Time for Common Sense

We present here the most ambitious Conservative programme for a
generation.

Its aim is to release the wisdom, decency and enterprise of British citizens.
We can achieve that by handing back to individuals and families the ability
to shape their own lives and communities.

We will free entrepreneurs to build businesses and to create prosperity, free
those who use public services to choose what is best for them and free those
who work in our schools and hospitals and police service from endless
political interference.

We want to set people free so that they have greater power over their own
lives. That is what I have always believed.

But there is something else too. I value those aspects of our national life

which are bigger than individuals and families. That is why we will nurture
our towns and cities, our countryside, our local institutions, our charities, our
democracy -- for they make us who we are as a nation.

Our programme is rooted in the instincts of millions of people whose beliefs
are mocked by Labour. It is rooted, in other words, in common sense.

It shouldn't be necessary to make an appeal to common sense. Yet the
common sense wisdom of the mainstream majority, on crime, or on taxes, or

the family, or on Europe, is under threat as never before.

Labour does not understand our country and cannot value what it cannot
understand.

This meddling and interfering Government is eroding our freedoms as well
as weakening the institutions that give us a sense of common purpose.

At this Election Britain has a choice between a Labour Party that trusts
government instead of people and a Conservative Party that trusts people
instead of government.

I trust the British people.

I trust their common sense.

It's time for common sense.

William Hague

Through our lives
Raising a family

Common sense means strengthening the family

¢ Less tax for families

¢ Support for marriage

¢ Freedom for headteachers and governors to run their own schools
¢ Power for parents to change management of failing schools

¢ Endowed universities and less onerous student loan repayments

Families feel more than ever that they are struggling to bring up their
children in an environment that is hostile.

They feel it is getting harder to make ends meet, especially when their
children are very young. They feel the Government only values childcare if
someone else is paid to provide it, and that it doesn't value marriage at all.
They feel that they are paying a fortune in tax, but they aren't getting the
education they want for their children.

They also worry that, however hard they try to bring up their children well,

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/2001/2001-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 37

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

the dangers of being drawn into crime and drug use are growing. And they
fear that passing our values on from one generation to the next is harder than
ever.

It's time for common sense.

Conservatives will help families bringing up children. We will let families
keep more of what they earn. We will support marriage. We will provide
choice and high standards in schools. And we will help parents who feel
they aren't getting enough help at the time they need it the most.

""We will introduce a new Married Couple's Allowance which will give a tax
cut worth £1,000 to many families when they need help most.

Cutting tax for families

The task of bringing up children is made much harder when families keep
less of what they earn, because the Government is taking more.

Labour have increased taxes on hardworking families. After four years of
Labour, a typical family was paying £670 more tax per year than when the
Government took office.

Despite all the evidence that marriage provides the best environment for
bringing up children, married couples do not fit into Labour's politically
correct agenda. That is why they have penalised millions of families by

abolishing the Married Couple's Tax Allowance.

Conservatives will give families a break.

We will cut taxes on families with children under 5 by increasing the
Children's Tax Credit by £200 a year. This means an extra £4 a week will be
taken off the tax bill of most families with young children, in addition to
what they receive in Child Benefit.

The arrival of children often puts a family under particular pressure. One
parent may give up work for a while, reducing the couple's income just when
their expenses are greatest.

A Conservative government will support families coping with these
pressures.

We will introduce a new Married Couple's Allowance which will give a tax
cut worth £1,000 to many families when they need help most. If someone is
not using all or part of their personal tax allowance they will be able to
transfer it to a working spouse if they have children under 11 or receive
Invalid Care Allowance in respect of a relative.

Mothers or fathers who stop working to care for children can sometimes find

it difficult to get back into paid work afterwards. This is where our Family
Scholarships scheme will help. Parents who have taken time out from their

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/2001/2001-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 37

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

careers in order to care for their children will be able to apply for a
scholarship to help them undertake vocational or professional training.

Widows and widowers find supporting children particularly difficult.
Conservatives will give extra help to all widows and widowers with
dependent children by removing tax on the Widowed Mother's Allowance
and the new Widowed Parent's Allowance. This will provide a valuable
increase of up to £20 per week in widowed parents'income.

It is right to boost the incomes of families with modest earnings. We will
reform the Working Families Tax Credit so it is once more paid as a benefit
direct to the caring parent. Up to 400,000 mothers will gain from this
reform.

More choice and higher standards in schools

The least parents should expect from all the taxes they pay is a decent school
for their children.

Labour promised much on education, but after four years in power they have
failed to deliver. That failure is no accident. It is because Labour have tried
to run the nation's schools from Whitehall.

Conservatives will pursue a very different policy.

Our objective is to give parents choice, and headteachers freedom. These
reforms will lead to schools of the sort parents want - schools with high
standards, schools which have their own traditions, a distinct ethos and
which wear their school uniform with pride.

Headteachers and their staff cannot command respect in their own schools if
they are treated as mere branch managers on the receiving end of
instructions from the council or from Whitehall. And teachers are leaving
the profession in droves because of all the pointless paperwork.

That is why it's time for common sense.

Conservatives will introduce ""Free Schools"". We will free every school in
the country from bureaucratic control and allow them to shape their own
character.

Heads and Governors will have complete responsibility for running their
schools. They will be able to choose how to reward excellence amongst their
teachers. And they will be able to use, as a criterion for admission, the
willingness of a pupil or parent to subscribe to a home-school agreement
which sets out the responsibilities of students and their school to each other.

We will abolish the nonsensical rules that make it difficult for Heads to
exclude disruptive pupils - we will not allow a few unruly pupils to damage
the education of everyone else.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/2001/2001-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 37

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

Instead, we will set up Progress Centres outside the schools. These Centres
will make sure disruptive pupils get specialist help to overcome their
problems so that where possible they may return to mainstream schools.

We plan to spend what the Government has planned. But with us more of the
money will actually get to the schools. We will save money currently wasted
on government and council bureaucracy, giving this money directly to
schools according to the number of pupils. By doing that each school would
have received, on average, an extra £540 per pupil in 1999/2000 to spend on
its own priorities.

Britain has some excellent schools. Often they are next door to mediocre
ones. Nothing is more frustrating for parents than to be told that they cannot
send their child to the school of their choice because its numbers are
artificially restricted in order to keep up numbers at a weaker school. So we
will abolish the rule that stops successful schools from expanding to take
more pupils. More parents will get their first choice of school for their
children.

Letting our best schools expand isn't enough. We want to see good new
schools springing up. We will allow churches and other faith communities,
groups of parents, charitable foundations and companies to set up new
schools. They will be entitled to per-pupil funding in the same way as
existing schools, and will be subject to the same standards and inspections.

The people who are most likely to realise that a school has problems are not
officials in a distant bureaucracy but the parents of children at the school.

Conservatives will give parents the right to call for a special Ofsted
inspection if they fear that their child's school is failing. If the inspectors
confirm their view, the school's management will have to be changed. This is
our Parent's Guarantee.

""We will let families keep more of what they earn. We will support marriage.
We will provide choice and high standards in schools.""

Reducing barriers for students

Students feel particularly aggrieved because Labour broke the promises they
made to them at the last election.

Good students are put off going to college because they will be burdened by
loans that must be repaid even when their income is relatively low.

Some are deterred from taking vital jobs, in teaching or in the health service,
because of the cost of their student loans.

Under Labour, student loans must be repaid as soon as a graduate's income
reaches £10,000 per year. With us, graduates will not have to pay anything
unless and until their income tops £20,000 per year. And we will not
introduce top-up fees.

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Freeing our universities

Our universities used to be the best in the world. Many of them still have a
formidable reputation, but they are under threat from interference by
politicians and uncertainty over their funding.

Conservatives want our universities to be free to shape their own character
and specialisms, competing with the world's best for students and research
funding.

To achieve their independence they need to have their own resources. We
will therefore create permanent endowment funds for Britain's universities.

Living safely

Common sense means having enough police to keep our streets safe and
a criminal justice system that reflects our values rather than
undermines them

¢ Increase police numbers

¢ Free police from bureaucracy so that they can get on with policing
e Take persistent young offenders off our streets

¢ Criminals to serve the sentence given by the court

¢ More rights for victim

We may have grown more prosperous as a nation, but the quality of our life
is still impoverished by crime.

Decent people, who work hard and who obey the law, are outraged that
criminals seem free to make their lives a misery.

Labour have talked tough on law and order but they have failed to deliver.
Police numbers have fallen, and violent crime is on the rise.

It's time for common sense.

Conservatives will trust the instincts of the mainstream majority on law and
order. That means more police and less bureaucracy holding them back. It
also means tougher sentences for some crimes and more honest sentencing
for all crimes.

""It's time to stop turning a blind eye to crimes committed by young offenders
and ensure instead that they are put back on the right track.""

Conservatives will increase the number of police officers on our streets by
reversing the cuts in police numbers that Labour have made.

We will free the police to get on with policing rather than paperwork.
Weighed down by regulations and under heavy political attack, police
morale has fallen to its lowest point for many years. We must raise police
morale. We will work with police forces to cut out bureaucracy, and to

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/2001/2001-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 37

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

devolve work that doesn't have to be carried out by the police to other
bodies.

People feel safer if they see police officers around.

So we will implement our ""cops in shops"" initiative - getting paperwork
done in visible places on the beat and not back in the station. And we will
encourage parish and town councils to create an additional new role, that of
the parish constable.

Under the Conservatives, the police will be encouraged to combat loutish
behaviour, graffiti, and vandalism which destroy the quality of every day life
for millions of people.

A hard core of persistent young offenders commit a disproportionate number
of crimes. They offend again and again, laughing at the law and making their
neighbours' lives a misery.

It's time to stop turning a blind eye to crimes committed by young offenders
and ensure instead that they are put back on the right track.

We will increase tenfold the number of places in Secure Training Centres -
taking persistent young menaces off our streets for at least 6 months. We will
link their release date to the attainment of objectives such as a recognised
qualification or standard of behaviour.

Drugs are now blighting even our rural communities, ruining lives and
causing a wave of other crimes like burglary and mugging. Conservatives
will give the police new powers to crack down on drug dealers.

Most evil of all are the drug dealers who try to lure children into addiction.
We will give a mandatory prison sentence to dealers convicted of selling
drugs to under-16s. And, in sentencing drug-pushers, judges will be allowed
to take into account, as an aggravating factor, any dealing done in the
vicinity of schools.

Conservatives will end the nonsense whereby criminals know full well they
will serve only a fraction of the prison sentence handed down by a judge.

We will introduce honesty in sentencing so that the sentence handed down in
court is the one served by the criminal. We will abolish Labour's special
early release scheme as well as automatic early release and ensure that any
discounts from the sentence are transparent, have to be earned and are
neither automatic nor substantial.

Prison life should not be a life of idleness. Under the Conservatives,
prisoners will be required to perform a proper day's work. The proceeds will
contribute to reparations for their victims and to the upkeep of their own
families. And prisoners will learn the habit of working, just as everyone else
has to do each day.

Sex offenders who have been released can now only be supervised for a

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/2001/2001-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 37

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

maximum of 10 years. Courts should be able to place sex offenders under
supervision for life. We will also introduce new laws to protect children
from paedophiles who use internet chat rooms.

Victims first

Too often criminals seem to enjoy more rights than their victims.
Conservatives will make sure that the justice system treats victims fairly.

A named police officer who is working on their case will be identified to
each victim, and they will have a similar continuous point of contact in the
Crown Prosecution Service. Both the police and the CPS will be required to
keep the victim informed as the investigation and prosecution progress and
written reasons must be given where charges are dropped or reduced.

We will also overhaul the law so that it is on the side of the victim not the
criminal. This will include the law on self defence and the double jeopardy
rule.

Earning a living
Common sense means less tax and regulation for people and businesses

¢ Lower taxes for businesses, families, savers, pensioners and motorists
¢ Public spending not to outstrip the growth of the economy

¢ No more stealth taxes - transparent economic policy

¢ Cut the cost of regulation on business every year

¢ Keep the pound

It is getting harder for people and businesses in Britain to earn a living.

It should be getting easier. The tough decisions and hard choices made by
the British people and Conservative

Governments in the 1980s and 1990s transformed our economic prospects,
and made Britain's businesses competitive.

But instead of advancing further we are slipping back. People who have to
watch every penny, see more and more of their money taken by the
Government. Businesses are spending too much time dealing with new
regulations, with too little time to focus on their customers.

It would be disastrous to re-elect a Government whose central economic
policy is to increase tax and regulation by stealth.

It's time for common sense.

We will cut taxes on people and businesses and cut government interference
and regulation in order to match the competition in the global marketplace.

Lower taxes

All over the world, governments of all political persuasions are cutting taxes
on people and businesses.

Yet Britain is going in the opposite direction. Labour promised not to raise
taxes. They have broken that promise. Experts have catalogued forty-five
separate tax increases since 1997.

Labour have said that, if they were re-elected, they would increase spending
each year faster than the growth of our national income. That inevitably

means even higher taxes.

Higher taxes come naturally to Labour, because they don't trust people to
spend their own money.

Conservatives do trust people to spend their own money, and we will

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/2001/2001-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 37

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

therefore pursue a very different policy.
We will be a tax-cutting government.

Each year, as the economy grows, we can spend more on vital public
services, but also allow people to keep more of their own money. We will
improve the performance of government and make policy changes so that
after two years we will be able to save £8 billion a year compared to
Labour's plans. These changes do not affect schools, the NHS, police or
defence.

We will return this £8 billion to people in tax cuts - set out throughout this
manifesto - targeted to help those who have been hit hardest by Labour's tax
increases.

Conservatives understand that our circumstances change through our lives -
most of us face financial pressures when we have young children, for
example, or find ourselves living on a fixed income in old age. So we will
carefully target tax cuts to help people at times in their lives when they need
it most, when they are struggling hard with difficult responsibilities.

This is not the end of our tax cutting ambitions. With proper control of
government spending in the second half of the next Parliament we can cut
taxes further. Among our priorities will be to raise the Inheritance Tax
threshold and to raise the threshold at which people begin to pay higher rate
income tax, because it currently catches people who are not, by any
definition, rich.

The tax burden has risen under Labour by 3 per cent of GDP from 35.2 per
cent in 1996/97 to 38.2 per cent in 2000/01 - that is the equivalent of 10p on
the basic rate of income tax.

Clearer and simpler taxes

Labour have tried to disguise their tax increases by introducing new stealth
taxes and making the tax system more complex. We want people to be able
to see how much they pay in tax, and to see it come down. We will run the
economy with discipline, and discipline requires transparency. So we will
send every taxpayer a clear statement of how the Government raises money
and then spends it.

We will create a National Accounts Commission to set standards of
transparency for the public accounts and stop politicians from meddling with
them for their own ends.

We need simpler taxes, too. Capital Gains Tax, for example, is exactly what
a tax ought not to be - at a high rate with lots of complicated exemptions.
Capital Gains Tax should be simplified, allowances removed and the rate
cut. The experience of the US and Ireland is that this stimulates enterprise
and tax revenues rise.

Conservatives will repeal the tax on IT consultants, the notorious IR35,

which has driven away from Britain some of our most productive workers.
We will replace it with targeted anti-avoidance measures.

Less regulation

Regulation is the new way Labour politicians control the economy.
Businesses they wouldn't dream of nationalising, they regulate.

It has the same consequences: the judgment of politicians and civil servants
is substituted for that of owners and entrepreneurs.

So a Conservative Government will cut the burden of regulation and free

businesses to serve their customers rather than serving their
regulators.Governments are held to account for the taxpayers' money they

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/2001/2001-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 37

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

spend. We think they should be similarly held responsible for the other costs
they impose on businesses. All new regulations will have to be scrutinised
by a new Deregulation Commission, which will have the power to send them
to Parliament for full debate. And the Commission will calculate, through an
independent audit, the cost of government regulations for business. It will
then set regulatory budgets for each government department alongside their
financial budgets. We will bring these regulatory budgets down, year after
year. The burden of regulation has ratcheted up for far too long. We will
reverse it.

Small businesses will be exempt from some regulations altogether.

Britain has been ahead of the field in the information economy because we
created an environment of low taxes and light regulation. But now we are
losing that advantage fast. We don't need more regulations, we need more
competition. The utility regulators must focus on competition and address
the market dominance of incumbents which stand in the way of competition.

We will abolish Labour's Climate Change Levy package. The necessary
carbon dioxide reduction can be achieved far more efficiently by other
means. We will also review the future of nuclear energy and its role in
contributing to reductions in CO, emissions.

Five disciplines for a sound economy

The next Conservative Government will operate within a sound and stable
financial framework based on five disciplines.

¢ We will keep the pound. Labour's plan for early entry into the euro is
the single biggest threat to our economic stability. By keeping the
pound we will keep control of our economic policy, including the
ability to set interest rates to suit British economic conditions.

¢ We will enhance the independence of the Bank of England's Monetary
Policy Committee.

¢ We will set up a Council of Economic Advisers, which will comment

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/2001/2001-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 37

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

publicly on whether the balance between spending and taxes
represents a prudent approach to the national finances, and is helping
secure low inflation and low interest rates.

¢ We will appoint a National Accounts Commission to draw up proper
national accounts, including a proper presentation of the Government's
long term liabilities.

¢ We will plot a course away from the direction in which the Chancellor
is leading us, and towards real annual increases in spending which are
within the trend rate of growth of the economy.

Staying healthy

Common sense means ending political interference in medical
judgments and giving choice to patients

e Increase funding for NHS

¢ Trust doctors and nurses, not politicians, to make medical decisions

¢ Give patients and GPs the right to choose in which hospital to be
treated

e Remove tax penalty on private medical insurance

¢ Guaranteed limits on waiting times for patients

The National Health Service is in a state of almost permanent crisis.

Too many of us experience a second-class system. People are waiting too
long to be treated; they are suffering shabby and unhygenic conditions in
hospitals; they have no choice in how, when or where they are looked after.
As people become used to choice and quality in other areas of their life, the
service they get from the NHS is increasingly unacceptable.

It's not just about money.

Ask anyone who works in the health service and they will tell you that the
NHS is now creaking under the strain of bureaucracy and Government
gimmicks. All the Government has done in four years is to substitute its own
political priorities and the pursuit of headlines for the clinical judgment of
doctors and nurses. Labour said they would cut waiting lists - so hospitals
have been forced to bring in waiting lists to get on the waiting list, and to
give priority to non-urgent operations over those in genuine medical need.

It's time for common sense. The next Conservative Government will match
the Government's plans for spending on the NHS but ensure the money goes
further.

We will take politicians out of the day-to-day management of the NHS,
putting in their place respect for clinical decisions and accountability to

patients.

We will also build a new partnership between the state and independent
sectors.

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

""The Conservative party is committed to a comprehensive NHS free to all its
users.""

The Patient's Guarantee

The NHS cannot succeed if those who work within it are not allowed to
succeed. Our National Health Service used to be an example to the world.
We still have first class doctors and nurses, and many of our hospitals have
international reputations for excellence. The clinical judgment of
professionals in the NHS is still among the best anywhere.

Yet, immediately on taking office, Labour introduced their Waiting List
Initiative which replaced clinical judgment with bogus political priorities.

Immediately on our taking office we will abolish the Waiting List initiative.
We will introduce a Patient's Guarantee instead.

The Patient's Guarantee will give patients a maximum waiting time in
defined clinical areas, starting with cardiac and cancer services, based on
their medical need as assessed by the patient's own consultant. The health
authority will be obliged either to treat the patient within that maximum
waiting time, or to arrange for the patient to have the choice of being treated
in another health authority or in a private hospital.

We will stop politicians interfering in clinical decisions and in the running of
hospitals.

The role of the Secretary of State will be to agree funding, and to regulate
standards of quality, not to micro-manage hospitals. We will create a
properly independent appointments body, and ensure that ministers cannot
interfere in its workings, so that people who work in the NHS are chosen
because of their expertise, not their politics.

The quality of the care people receive in hospital is determined as much by
standards on the ward as by their surgical procedures. Yet while Ward Sisters
are held responsible for the well-being of their patients, they do not have
authority over many of the activities, such as feeding and cleaning, that
determine the quality of the care they provide.

We will require hospitals to give back authority to Ward Sisters, so that they
can make sure that their patients get

the care they demand. And we want to bring back Matron so that someone is
responsible for overseeing and supporting the nursing staff.

Choice for GPs and patients

One of the best ways of improving the performance of the NHS is to give
patients choice.

When Labour were elected they limited GPs' freedom to refer patients to the
hospital of their choice.

We will give back to patients and their doctors the power to choose.

Patients will be able to be treated in the hospital which they and their GPs
choose, and will have full access to information on hospitals'waiting lists
and success rates to enable them to make that choice.

Hospitals will be rewarded for the operations they carry out, so that good
hospitals can attract more patients and more funding, and patients will be
able to choose to be treated in hospitals with world-class expertise in their
illness.

We will allow alternative and complementary therapies to be made available
through the NHS, provided they are of proven clinical effectiveness.

We will give doctors the right to decide how they organise themselves to
deliver the best care to their patients.

GPs have told us that they don't want a new upheaval in primary care: we
will follow their advice. Instead, we will give GPs the choice of whether to
operate as Primary Care Trusts if they think that is right for themselves and
their patients. And we will encourage GPs to specialise, so that GP teams
will be increasingly able to offer expert diagnosis and treatment to their
patients. That way, many patients will get expert opinions and care by
doctors they know, without the need to go to hospital.

Choice for patients extends to private healthcare.

Because of the problems in the health service many people with modest
incomes spend their hard-earned savings on paying privately for operations
or for medical insurance for themselves and their families. In doing so, they
free resources in the NHS and help reduce waiting times, but often at
considerable personal cost.

The Conservative Party is committed to a comprehensive NHS free to all its
users. There is no question of anyone being forced to take out private
insurance. But if people do choose to insure themselves privately they
should not be penalised for making this choice.

Labour imposes a tax penalty on employers who offer their employees
private medical insurance, and then taxes again any employee who has this
benefit. It doesn't make sense and, when affordable, we will abolish both
taxes.

""We will stop politicians from interfering in clinical decisions and in the
running of hospitals.""

We will ensure hospices are properly funded by increasing the state's
contribution from 32% to 40% for adult hospices and from 4% to 40% for

children's hospices.

More patients treated, more quickly

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/2001/2001-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 37

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Conservatives will unblock the bottlenecks that slow down treatment in the
NHS.

We will, for example, encourage the development of stand-lone surgical
units specialising in a particular type of standard operation, such as cataract
surgery or hip replacements. These units would be funded by the NHS and
be free of charge for patients, but could be operated by either NHS or private
providers. They would enable us to make rapid reductions in the waiting
times required for these procedures.

It doesn't take a doctor to take a patient's blood pressure. We will encourage
an expansion in the role of practice nurses to take on some of the tasks
carried out by GPs, allowing them more time to see more patients.

Some health authorities allow doctors to prescribe certain new drugs, and
some do not. Conservatives will end this lottery whereby the postcode you
live in determines the treatment you receive by introducing an Exceptional
Medicines Fund. Expensive new medicines - such as Beta Interferon for
multiple sclerosis - will be funded direct to doctors from a budget set by the
Secretary of State. Access to the funding will be decided by criteria laid
down by a panel of senior clinicians and academics.

Conservatives will ensure that important issues of medical ethics are
properly debated in Parliament.

Growing older

Common sense means respect and independence for older people

¢ Cut taxes for pensioners

¢ Increase the basic state pension

¢ Abolish compulsory annuities at age 75

e Allow younger workers to opt for properly funded private pensions
¢ Protect the savings and homes of those needing long term care

Older people are among our most responsible citizens and give a great deal
to their communities, but they have been demeaned and patronised by this
Government. They resent being seen as a burden. And they fear they do not
have a place in Blair's Cool Britannia.

To be able to have the standard of living to which they are entitled, Britain's
pensioners now have to apply to the Statefor special favours. When Labour
came into office, 37 per cent of pensioners had to take the means test in
order to get their benefit entitlement. On Labour's current plans, within two
years most pensioners - 57 per cent - will have to apply to the State for help
in this undignified and intrusive way.

Pensioners are proud of being able to take responsibility for themselves, but

Labour has denied them this dignity. Instead they have taxed pensioners
more heavily and driven them on to means-tested benefits.

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

It's time for common sense.

Conservatives will give pensioners greater independence from the State, by
cutting taxes, removing a million pensioners from income tax altogether, and
by increasing the basic state pension - with no strings attached.

""We will abolish the rule which currently forces pensioners to buy an annuity
when they reach 75.""

Freeing pensioners from tax

It is wrong that pensioners with modest incomes find themselves paying
income tax. It is particularly unfair that pensioners who have saved for their
retirement - from their salaries on which they have already paid tax - are
then taxed again on the interest their savings earn. We will abolish taxes on
savings for most savers - which will be of particular benefit to pensioners.

A Conservative Government will also raise the special age tax allowance for
pensioners by £2,000, from around £6,000 to over £8,000 per year. This will
take one million pensioners out of income tax altogether and many other
pensioners will pay £8.50 less tax per week.

A higher pension

Conservatives want to provide support to pensioners when they need it most.
This should not entail more and more pensioners facing the indignity and
bureaucracy of means tests.

So we will offer pensioners a substantial increase in the basic state pension.

At our first opportunity to uprate pensions, in April 2002, we will match the
Government's plans for an increase of £3 a week for a single pensioner under
75 and £4.80 for a married couple under 75.

But we will go further in helping older pensioners, who tend to be poorer.
Over-75s will have a bigger uprating of £4 for a single pensioner and £6.80
for a married couple. We will be helping poorer pensioners without more
means-testing.

Pensioners can carry on receiving the free TV licence, the Winter Fuel
Payment, and the Christmas bonus exactly as at present. But, if they prefer
it, we will give every pensioner the choice to opt for a higher basic pension,
which consolidates these individual payments, tax-free.

This option will be available to all pensioners who get their pension uprated,
including groups that Labour forgot - the 200,000 in nursing homes and

residential accommodation who do not receive the winter fuel payment and
360,000 pensioners living abroad.

Funded pensions

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

The best way to make sure that people have decent incomes in their
retirement is for them to invest during their lives in assets that will grow. But
the state takes people's national insurance contributions and then fails to
invest them, leaving pensioners with miserly pensions.

We need to make it easier for people to provide for a prosperous retirement.

But Labour have hit private and occupational pensions with higher taxes.
And many of the current generation of working people have expectations of
the pension they are likely to receive which are unfortunately way ahead of
the likely reality.

The best way to achieve higher pensions in the future is by more genuine
funding of pensions. We wish to enable young people to build up a funded
alternative to the basic pension for the future. No-one would be forced to
change. The basic state pension would continue to be paid as now, not
merely to current pensioners but to people of working age and new entrants
who want it in the future. We will consult on how best to offer this new
option of funded pensions for young people.

We will also abolish the rule which currently forces pensioners to buy an
annuity when they reach 75.

People with personal pensions will only need to ensure that they have
sufficient income to keep free of means-tested benefits.

The remaining capital in the pension fund will be theirs to keep and - if they
wish - to pass on to their children.

""We will abolish taxes on savings for most savers - which will be of
particular benefit to pensioners.""

Long term care

We also want to tackle another problem which preys on the minds of many
people as they become older - meeting the costs of long-term care. Our
proposed funding of the NHS matches Labour's plans and includes a
commitment that all nursing care will be free at the point of use. But we
need to go further to get at the source of the problem.

We will consider how people who have made prudent provision in advance
for the cost of long term care can be protected from having their assets taken
by the state if their actual care costs are more than could reasonably be
foreseen.

Britain is one of the world's most respected democracies, one of its most
influential leaders, one of its most prosperous nations and one of its greatest
military powers.

Our possession of all of these qualities, which we rightly value, depends
upon our ability to govern ourselves. And all of them are put at risk by the
threat that is now posed to our independence.

Labour have lost confidence in our ability to govern ourselves.

It's time for common sense.

The next Conservative Government will secure our independence and use
Britain's great strengths to help create a flexible Europe of nations, to

maintain the Atlantic Alliance and to develop the role of the
Commonwealth.

our national veto on European legislation.""

In Europe, not run by Europe

The guiding principle of Conservative policy towards the European Union is
to be in Europe, but not run by Europe. We will lead a debate in Europe
about its future, promoting our own clear and positive vision.

The European Union has, with the prospect of enlargement, reached a fork in
the road. Down one route lies a fully integrated superstate with nation states
and the national veto disappearing. The Government is taking us down this
route.

The alternative is a Europe of nations coming together in different
combinations for different purposes and to differing extents. In other words,
a network Europe. If Britain leads the debate, we can make this alternative a
reality.

We will insist on a Treaty 'flexibility' provision, so that outside the areas of
the single market and core elements of an open, free-trading and competitive
EU, countries need only participate in new legislative actions at a European
level if they see this as in their national interest.

At the same time, we are willing to support the principle of 'reinforced co-
operation’ in Europe, under which small groups of countries can become
more closely integrated if they wish to do so, providing it does not damage
Britain's national interest.

The next Conservative Government will keep the pound. We will maintain
our national veto on European legislation. Giving up either would put our
ability to govern ourselves at risk. We will not ratify the Nice Treaty but will
renegotiate it so that Britain does not lose its veto.

We also propose to amend our domestic law to include 'reserved powers'.
This will prevent EU law from overriding the will of Parliament in areas
which Parliament never intended to transfer to the EU.

This policy will be reinforced with a determination to veto further transfers
of power from Westminster to Brussels. Should any future Government wish
to surrender any more of Parliament's rights and power to Brussels they
should be required to secure approval for such a transfer in a referendum.

We intend to press for the single market to be completed and for competition
laws to be stronger so that British businesses which play by the rules are not
undercut by other companies that do not.

We will also press for Europe to tackle fraud and maladministration as a
matter of priority. If the EU reduced waste and abandoned ill-considered

programmes, it could make significant reductions in the overall size of the
European budget.

A military power and a staunch ally

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

One of the reasons that Britain is respected around the world is that it
remains a first-class military power.

The British way of life and freedom and democracy around the world are
made more secure by the professionalism of our armed forces and the
success of our long term military alliances.

Yet now all this is under threat.

The last four years have seen our armed forces come under increased
pressure. Overstretched and undermanned, they have also come under attack
from those more interested in political correctness than operational
effectiveness. At the same time, our primary alliance, NATO, is being
weakened by a concerted drive to create an independent military structure in
the EU. And for the first time, a British government is leading this attempt.

A Conservative Government would pursue a very different policy.

We think it is common sense to support institutions that work. Our armed
forces and NATO work very well.

So we will support our armed forces by setting out to match commitments to
capabilities, by making it a priority to achieve the armed forces' full manning
levels and by opposing political correctness. We will exempt the armed
forces from the European Convention on Human Rights, just as France,
Spain, Portugal and others have done.

We will seek greater flexibility to deal with unplanned commitments and to
reduce overstretch. We will reform the Territorial Army and enhance the role
of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and our other Reserve Forces.

Conservatives have always supported stronger European defence co-
operation, but always inside NATO. We will not participate in a structure
outside NATO, but will insist instead that any European initiative is under
the NATO umbrella.

We will also end this Government's equivocation over the development by
the US of ballistic missile defences. We believe our close ally deserves our
support in countering new threats from rogue states and terrorists equipped
with weapons of mass destruction. We will take a lead in building support

for ballistic missile defence against threats to Europe and America.

We remain fully committed to Britain's independent nuclear deterrent.
Coming to the aid of

We will do what we can to encourage responsible behaviour by aid
recipients, by focusing on good governance, and by strengthening civil
society, free markets, the rule of law and anti-corruption measures.

We will increase the involvement of charities and the voluntary sector. We
will double the proportion of our aid budget spent through aid charities, as
they are often better placed than governments to relieve suffering. We will
also establish a central information service, 'Aid Direct', that will build
strong direct links between aid donors and recipients.

Multilateral aid and development institutions are crying out for reform. In
particular, we are calling for the EU to set its house in order. Unless the
Commission reforms its management, we will propose a treaty amendment
allowing member states to deliver aid bilaterally instead.

We will press for more effective debt relief, action on HIV/AIDS and
conflict prevention and resolution.

We will appoint an Envoy for Religious Freedom.

""We want early enlargement of the European Union - the first wave,
including Cyprus, should be admitted by 2004.""

Taking a lead in the world

The world is changing. The old power blocs are declining in importance.
Nations, and networks between nations, are taking centre stage.

Conservatives will build on Britain's strengths, so Britain can be a force for
good. Britain has prospered when trade has been free. We will lead the
campaign for a trans-Atlantic free trade area, encompassing the EU and
NAFTA. This is a step towards our vision of global free trade by 2020.
Britain has an unrivalled diplomatic service. We will strengthen it further by
creating a new Foreign, Commonwealth and Trade Office to bring
diplomacy and free trade together, giving renewed impetus to trade and
commerce.

The Commonwealth has huge potential - as a force for stability, for
promoting the rule of law, democracy and the open economy, and potentially
as a means of focusing UK aid. We will consult with our partners on
implementing many of the recommendations of the Commonwealth
Commission.

We will use Britain's influence in the world for peace and stability, whether
in Kashmir or Cyprus or the Middle East.

Britain has vast global reach. In a world where geography matters less,
Britain is not on the periphery of anything. Uniquely, we have a central place
in the EU, NATO, the Commonwealth and the UN. A Conservative
government will be outward-looking, using our influence to the full.

A safe haven, not a soft touch, on asylum

Over the centuries Britain has welcomed people who have been persecuted
by oppressive regimes overseas.

But now our ability to be a safe haven for the genuinely oppressed is
severely hampered by the virtual collapse of our asylum system. This chaos
encourages unfounded asylum claims.

Britain has gained a reputation as a soft touch for bogus asylum seekers.

This Government has allowed a crisis to develop which has encouraged an
illegal trade in human misery, blighting many lives.

The problem here is worse than anywhere else in Europe because of
Labour's mismanagement. The Government has presided over massive
delays in processing applications and admits that thousands of those whose
cases are rejected simply disappear and never leave.

In four years, Labour has seen the cost of the asylum system double and put
a great strain on many communities. Our policy will be that all new asylum
applicants are housed in secure reception centres until their cases are
determined. This will speed up the process of establishing which claims are
well-founded. Asylum applications from safe countries will not normally be
accepted.

We will ensure that those whose claims are rejected are quickly deported by
a new Removals Agency.

Conservatives will restore common sense to Britain's asylum procedures.
A stronger society

Common sense means responsible citizens and a smaller state

¢ Create an Office of Civil Society to champion families, voluntary
organisations and faith communities

¢ Reform taxation for charities

e Pay independent groups to get people back to work and find them
lasting jobs

¢ Protect the savings of disabled people and help them find work

¢ Tackle welfare fraud

A strong society rests on responsible individuals and families. They need to
be able to turn to straightforward, reliable

help when times are bad. But that should not become dependence on the
state when times are good.

Labour promised to reform the welfare state, but they shirked the challenge.

It's time for common sense.

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

The next Conservative Government will help build a stronger society. We
will provide support for individuals and families when they need it. And we
will encourage people to take responsibility for themselves and their
families.

Tolerance is one of Britain's historic virtues. A strong society is built on
respect for all people - whatever their race, religion, gender or sexual
orientation.

Welfare without the state

Many of our poorest people are forced to struggle with a mess of
complicated and ill thought out government schemes. And at the same time,
the Government is squeezing out genuine voluntary groups, who are best
able to help people in real need.

Conservative policy will be very different.

A Conservative Government will tackle the problems of poverty and
disadvantage with the same vigour and inventiveness with which we tackle
Britain's economic problems. Central government will not try to do
everything by itself. Instead we will work with volunteers, charities and
local institutions to bring new life to our communities.

We will establish a new Office of Civil Society to give families, faith
communities and voluntary groups a voice at the heart of Government. The
Office will cut through the bureaucracy that stops the good neighbours of
Britain from helping those in need.

We hope to help charities by abolishing their irrecoverable VAT liabilities.
The Government refuses to be frank about the money that Whitehall
departments have set aside for preparations for converting to the euro, but
we believe they are substantial. We will divert this money to fund this major
reform of taxation for charities.

Effective help for unemployed people

It is a cruel trick on unemployed people to place them on training schemes
which often do little or nothing to improve their long-term employment
prospects.

Labour's New Deal raised people's hopes but has failed to deliver.
Unemployment has fallen more slowly under this Government than under
the last one.

The next Conservative Government will help unemployed people back into
work more effectively than ever before.

We will replace the New Deal with 'Britain Works'. Independent contractors
will be rewarded not just for their success in helping the unemployed to find
jobs but also for enabling them to keep those jobs.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/2001/2001-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 25 of 37

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

This will address one of the worst failures of this Government's employment
policies - the revolving door which takes people through a cycle of benefits,
training schemes, and temporary work, only to end up back on benefits.

The best way of helping unemployed people is to get them back into work as
quickly as possible. That is the basis of our Can Work, Must Work
Guarantee. Those who can work must do so or they will lose their
unemployment benefits.

Helping people into the labour market

There is evidence that it is in the best interests of children of a lone parent
for that parent to be working when the child is of secondary school age. It
increases the chances that the child will get good qualifications and go on
successfully to hold down a job.

We will therefore expect lone parents on income support with children over
11 to be actively seeking the sort of jobs which they can combine with their
family responsibilities.

Labour have treated people with disabilities appallingly - means-testing their
benefits and eroding their supported employment. It is time for them to have
a better deal.

The Government is treating the savings of disabled people on Income
Support less generously than pensioners in the same circumstances. This is
an indefensible and unprecedented discrimination against disabled people.
We will tackle it head-on. We will increase the amount of savings which a
disabled person can have before losing benefit, matching the entitlement of
pensioners.

Disabled people who have lost their jobs can become trapped on Incapacity
Benefit.

We will address this problem by creating a new agency which will pay
Incapacity Benefit on the basis of current entitlements.

But it will also have the funds to obtain the physiotherapy or the physical
aids which can help disabled people back to work as quickly as possible.

""Britain is made up of many ethnic communities. Conservatives believe that
we are richer and stronger for it.""

An effective attack on fraud

Instead of reforming welfare, Labour have made it even more complex.
Instead of encouraging self-reliance they have spread dependence on means
tests. Complicated means-tested benefits are not just demeaning, they are
also wide open to fraud and abuse. The Government itself has admitted that
there could be £7 billion of fraud. In 1998/99 there were 160,000 established
cases of Housing Benefit and Council Tax benefit fraud, but just 800

successful prosecutions - 99.5% of fraudsters are not successfully
prosecuted. We will introduce a tough anti-fraud package, including a single
integrated task force to tackle fraud nationwide. There are 80 million
National Insurance numbers which is rather more than the entire UK
population. Some of these numbers are fraudulent and we will clean them

up.
Town & Country

Common sense means valuing the distinctiveness of both town and
country

and rural businesses

¢ Establish Regeneration Companies to revitalise inner cities and
housing estates

¢ Cut business rates for rural shops, pubs, garages and village post

¢ Cut fuel tax to help motorists

Local communities are life's essential harbours. They provide us with a
strong sense of local identity. But too many are under enormous pressure.
Our countryside, ignored by the Government, has been devastated by the
Foot and Mouth crisis. There are too many urban and rural communities that
are not sharing in our country's prosperity and where deprivation passes
from generation to generation. There are other neighbourhoods where many
young people cannot afford to live, despite having grown up there.

It's time for common sense.

Conservatives will restore to communities a sense that they can shape their
neighbourhoods, influence local architecture and improve the quality of their
surroundings. And we will take effective action to help our rural
communities and businesses recover from the effects of Foot and Mouth.

""Farming and the countryside are in crisis. Foot and Mouth disease is but
the latest in a series of blows inflicted on our farmers.""

Recovering from Foot and Mouth

The Foot and Mouth crisis has been a disaster for our countryside. Farmers
have seen years of hard work destroyed in weeks. Rural businesses have
seen their turnover collapse. Animals have suffered welfare problems of a
kind we never expected to see in Britain. The tragedy is that the crisis need
not have been as widespread or so prolonged if the Government had acted
urgently and decisively from the beginning.

The priority now must to be help the countryside recover. Immediately upon
taking office, we will implement our Strategy for Recovery - practical steps

to stamp out Foot and Mouth once and for all; help for struggling tourism
and other rural business and firm action to prevent infection entering Britain
again.

Farming and the countryside

Foot and Mouth disease is but the latest in a series of blows inflicted on our
farmers.

The Common Agricultural Policy has damaged consumers, farmers, the
taxpayer and the environment. It must be reformed to cut the bill for
taxpayers and consumers, provide sustainable long term support for farming,
and protect the environment and the countryside. We will renegotiate the
CAP so that many decisions currently taken at EU level would be taken by
the governments of individual member states.

Farmers and other rural businesses spend too much time on form-filling and
red tape. The next Conservative Government will not enforce European
regulations any sooner or more zealously than other countries.

We will also fight for a fair deal for consumers, by introducing honesty in
labelling and requiring the country of origin and method of production of the
main ingredients to be stated on the label of all food products.

We will also renegotiate the Common Fisheries Policy. We will insist on
national or local controls being established over our own waters, whether
through zonal management, or coastal management, or in some other way.

We will improve animal protection and welfare by building on the successes
of the last Conservative Government to raise animal welfare standards in
Europe.

The Foot and Mouth crisis has not only badly damaged farming but has also
damaged the general rural economy and all that depends on it. Alongside the
farming crisis, rural communities are losing their post offices, pubs and
police stations at alarming rates.

Labour neither understands the needs of the countryside nor even cares
about its survival.
We need a new approach.

The next Conservative government will protect the liberty and livelihood of
rural communities. Our policies on transport, crime, planning and Europe
will all benefit the countryside.

We will cut business rates for rural shops, pubs, garages and village post
offices and change the rules so that they can provide new, much-needed local

services. We will encourage more passenger-friendly rural transport services
and give community transport schemes a tax rebate on their fuel cost.

Post offices round the country are closing in record numbers because the

Government has announced the ending of cash payment of pensions and
benefits at post offices. We recognise the essential part played by post offices
as a focus of community life.

We will remove Labour's threat and instead introduce a benefit card which
will cut fraud and bring large efficiency gains while continuing to bring
business into post offices.

We will abolish centrally-driven national or regional housebuilding targets.
Local councils accountable to local people should be responsible for meeting
local housing needs. Where there is rapid population growth, central
government should work in partnership with local councils to invest in
additional infrastructure.

As well as our Green Belts, we will take action to protect our rivers,
wetlands, lakes, canals and coastline from development by establishing
""Blue Belt"" areas.

The Conservatives will establish a new Select Committee on Rural Affairs to
monitor the impact on rural communities of all aspects of government
policy.

The regeneration of urban Britain

The future of the countryside is bound up with the future of our inner cities.
As long as people leave the cities to occupy new houses built on green fields
there can be no prospect of an urban revival.

We must start by making our cities places where families want to live and
put down roots. That means tackling the problems that drive many familes to
leave. First and foremost this means education and crime. In too many of our
inner cities families with young children feel they have to get out to get
educated. And until there is effective policing and the streets are safe, money
spent improving houses or encouraging enterprise will have little impact.

The next Conservative Government will establish new local Regeneration
Companies to drive the campaign to revitalise our inner cities and outer
urban estates.

Working with local councils, businesses and people they will be able to buy
extra policing strength, help set up Partner Schools, and tear down the worst
tower blocks. They will have statutory powers to accelerate the planning and
development of rundown areas.

We will support radical solutions to the long term decline of coastal towns -
bringing in new measures to help them support and market their heritage,
protect their coastline, improve transport links, and tackle the problems they
face in housing asylum-seekers.

We will also tackle the problem of 'neighbours from hell’. We will enable the
eviction of residents who break tenancy agreements, fail to pay their rent and

desecrate the neighbourhood. We will tackle the problems which undermine
the quality of life in these areas such as litter, graffiti, and dumped cars. We
will also tackle insensitive siting of mobile phone masts without adequate
consultation.

We will streamline planning procedures to make it easier for new houses to
be built on brownfield sites. We will give local councils power to declare
extra areas of local Green Belt.

And we will make Britain a nation of homeowners. We will increase the
right-to-buy discounts on council homes and introduce a new rent-to-
mortgage scheme. Homesteading grants will allow people to first repair, and
then own empty council housing.

Conservatives will give housing associations more freedom to compete in
the housing market. We will encourage greater involvement of tenants in
running their estates.

Foot and Mouth: A Strategy for Recovery

Conservatives have played a constructive role throughout the Foot and
Mouth crisis.We have put forward practical policies to speed up the
eradication of the disease,give real help to businesses hit by the crisis and to
ease the suffering of animals.

Immediately upon taking office we will implement a Strategy for Recovery
including action to:

¢ speed up disposal of slaughtered animals

e unblock delays in compensation for affected farms

¢ offer interest-free loans for affected businesses

¢ properly fund campaigns to promote the tourist industry

¢ block high risk food imports to prevent Foot and Mouth recurring

Transport

Labour promised 'immediate benefits' in transport. But public transport has
become worse, while our roads are more congested than ever. Britain has the
highest road user taxes in Europe and the worst traffic jams. Labour want to
force car drivers off the roads, without offering an alternative. They will tax
drivers who come into town centres, and tax those who need to park at work.

Last year, Labour took £36 billion from road users but they spent less than
£8 billion on transport. Conservatives are not anti-car, but we are anti-
pollution, and so we will cut taxes on cleaner fuels and cleaner vehicles.

We will set out long term investment plans for roads and public transport,
meeting the needs of commuters, cyclists, pedestrians, and elderly and
disabled people. We will establish a new Roads Standards Unit to champion
the interests of road users. It will aim to take through traffic out of towns and

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/2001/2001-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 30 of 37

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

villages and minimise the environmental effects of roads. It will set sensible
speed limits for each stretch of road, and make roads safer.

Unlike Labour, we will not ban people from driving if they marginally
exceed the 70mph limit on motorways. Instead we will look to improve the
traffic flow on motorways by increasing the speed limit to 80 mph where it is
safe to do so, and enforcing this speed limit rigorously. We will target the
hard core of bad drivers who are the main cause of accidents.

We will restore the competitiveness of the British haulage, shipping, and
aviation industries. We will charge foreign lorries for the use of British roads
with our Brit Disc scheme.

We will cut tax on petrol and diesel by 6p per litre. It is technology, not
taxation, that cuts pollution from vehicles.

We will revive the railway industry so it achieves airline standards of service
and safety. We will stop Labour's policy of blame and shame. We will
implement the Cullen Inquiry recommendations. Subject to a 'no strike' deal
we will work with Bob Kiley - who transformed the New York subway - and
support his ambitions to create a world class London Underground.

The wider environment

Conservatives believe that each of us should act as a steward preserving and
enhancing the natural world and the built environment for future
generations.

The biggest global environmental challenge is to prevent climate change
causing long-term damage through extreme weather conditions. We will
meet the commitments made by successive British governments by a
comprehensive package of emission permit trading, energy conservation
measures, tax incentives, greater encouragement of renewable energy and
cleaner energy generation.

A civilised country

Common sense means supporting the people that create a thriving
culture

e Free arts organisations from dependence on the state by giving them
endowments

¢ Back the tourism industry

¢ Privatise the commercially successful Channel Four

e Simplify regulation of British broadcasting and communications
¢ Support youth, grass roots and elite sport

Government policy towards the arts, sports and broadcasting has stumbled
from fiasco to disaster in the last four years.

The Government wasted millions of pounds on bailing out the Dome,
botched the development of Wembley stadium, dithered over the new UK
Sports Institute, and supervised a bizarre competition to run the National
Lottery only to end up handing it back to the existing firm.

This incompetence has been accompanied by a disdain for British traditions
and a modish contempt for our heritage. Labour even promoted a bogus new
culture - 'Cool Britannia' - in an attempt to supplant the culture and identity
which has shaped us.

It's time for common sense.

A Conservative Government will be optimistic about Britain's future because
we are comfortable with Britain's past.

""Tony Blair said that the Dome would be a vivid symbol of Labour’s Britain.
That is exactly what it was. Step inside and you could be anywhere - it was
banal, anonymous and rootless. It lacked a sense of Britain's history or
culture.""

Freeing our culture from political interference

The last Conservative Government transformed the funding of sport, the arts
and our historic environment by creating the National Lottery. We ensured
that money from this source was additional to Government spending, and
administered independently.

Labour have increasingly taken control of Lottery funds. The rules which
govern applications for Lottery funds are excessively complex. We will
reform them, so that they are more accessible to small community groups.

We will set about freeing the arts from Government interference.

Using the proceeds from the sale of Channel 4 and undistributed surpluses
from the Lottery, we will create a £3 billion endowment fund for cultural
organisations.

This will dramatically extend freedom from State dependency and political
control.

Conservatives recognise the role of the arts in developing the creative skills
which are essential to Britain's future prosperity.

We will undertake a radical review of the Arts Council of England and the
Regional Arts Boards. We want to create a less bureaucratic funding
structure which delivers more for the arts and for artists.

Britain's £65 billion tourist industry is a powerful force for urban and rural
regeneration. Under Labour, Britain's trade deficit in tourism has doubled,
and tourist businesses have been hit by a tide of new regulations. We will

back Britain around the world by increasing support for the British Tourist

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Authority and restoring a voice for English Tourism. This will be all the
more important in the light of the disastrous impact of Foot and Mouth
disease on the whole sector.

Championing sport

The success of our athletes in the Sydney Olympics showed how important
sport can be in creating a sense of national pride. The dedication and skill of
our Olympic team was supported by funds from the National Lottery,
established by the last Conservative Government. We will ensure that our
elite athletes get the funding they need to achieve excellence in the future.

But our future success is threatened because too few young people get the
chance to take part in sport at school.

Conservatives will give back to headteachers and governors the right to offer
adequate time for sport. We will also give further protection to playing
fields.

We will reform the law to enable local voluntary sports clubs to apply for
charitable status, strengthening their financial base and encouraging private
investment in grassroots sport, and helping to safeguard their assets for
future generations.

We will look to streamline the over-complex funding structures for sport,
reducing the number of quangoes and devolving more funds to a more

rationalised network of governing bodies.

""Conservatives recognise the role of the arts in developing the creative skills
which are essential to Britain's future prosperity.""

Freeing the media and communications industries

Our best media companies lead the world in quality and innovation.

Conservatives deregulated the telecommunications market and Britain was
well placed to benefit from the convergence of media and communications
technologies.

But we are throwing away our head start. Labour have stalled over
liberalising telecommunications. The numerous overlapping regulatory

authorities in the communications industries urgently need rationalising.

The next Conservative Government will make Britain once again a beacon
of competition in the communications industries.

We will privatise Channel 4, while maintaining its public service remit. The
State has no business owning a commercial TV company.

We will introduce early legislation to create a single regulator for the media
and communications industries charged with speeding up the introduction of

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/2001/2001-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 33 of 37

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

competition. We will liberate media companies from outdated ownership
rules and ensure that regulation is minimised, while protecting the
vulnerable from offensive material.

Our policy will deliver fair and independent regulation of the BBC. The
regulator will require the BBC to make the most of its assets for the benefit
of the licence fee payer but to rein in any expansion plans which are hostile
to competition.

We will ensure that religious broadcasters have fair and equal access to
future competitions for local, national, digital and programme service
licences.

A proud democracy

Common sense means fewer politicians and more local decision-making

e Transfer power from central government to effective local councils

¢ Local referendums before large increases in Council Tax

e Abolish artificial regional tiers of administration in England

¢ Reform Parliament so that only English and Welsh MPs vote on
exclusively English and Welsh matters

¢ Strengthen parliamentary scrutiny of the Government

Britain's democracy has always been one of our greatest strengths. It has
made our country what it is, and has embodied and defended our freedoms.

But after four years of Labour, the way we govern ourselves has been
abused. We have an arrogant and complacent Government which ignores
Parliament and people. We have the anomaly of MPs from Scotland and
Northern Ireland voting on laws that apply only to England and Wales. The
House of Lords, historically a source of balance and independence, has
suffered a botched reform.

People identify with their local communities. But under this Government
they are being marginalised by alien new regional bureaucracies that are

costly, unaccountable and unnecessary.

Our constitution is being perverted, and faith in politics and politicians is at
an all time low.

It's time for common sense.
A Conservative Government will revitalise our democracy by giving more
power to local people, and once more placing Parliament at the centre of our

national life.

People feel at home in their local communities, be they counties, towns,
villages or parishes.

But real communities are being weakened by too much government from

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/2001/2001-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 34 of 37

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Whitehall, and by the imposition of artificial new layers of government with
which people don't identify. The next Conservative Government will
revolutionise the attitude of central government to local government.

The best councils offer excellent value for money and serve their
communities well. Conservatives believe that councils that have such a track
record of success should be trusted with more power. They will be able to
become 'free councils'. We will devolve financial and administrative power
from central government to them, and establish a stronger link between the
money they raise and the money they spend.

We believe that local citizens should decide how much their council will
spend. The next Conservative Government will not use its powers to cap
local council budgets.

We will abolish many of the national targets and plans that local councils are
forced to follow by Whitehall.

Alongside this policy of granting greater freedom to the best councils must
come some protection from abuses by the worst. So we will look at ways in
which local councils proposing increases in their budgets significantly above
the rate of inflation can be obliged to hold a local referendum on the increase
in the Council Tax which this would entail. We will also retain Section 28 of
the Local Government Act.

Labour have introduced a new tier of regional bureaucracy. But almost no-
one identifies with the arbitrary regions into which the country has been
carved up - they owe nothing to where people feel they actually belong.

We will abolish the Regional Development Agencies that the Government
has introduced and scrap Labour's plans for new Regional Assemblies. We
will give responsibility for enterprise and development back to county
councils, and to unitary authorities where appropriate, and save the £70
million a year that the RDAs are spending in administration.

Britain's constitution has never been set in stone, but has evolved and
adapted to cope with the changing circumstances of different centuries.
Because Labour do not understand how the history and stability of our
democratic structures have underpinned our national life, they have altered
them in a crude, unthinking way, often for narrow party advantage.

As Conservatives have demonstrated in our constructive participation in the
Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, we will work to ensure devolution
is a success.

But we will restore balance to our vandalised democracy.

When Parliament is discussing something that affects the whole of the
United Kingdom, all MPs should vote. But only English and Welsh MPs will
be entitled to vote on Government Bills relating to England and Wales. And
English MPs alone will vote on the remaining laws which apply exclusively
to England.

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

In changing the way Parliament works our overriding objective will be to
strengthen the ability of the House of Lords and the House of Commons to
hold the Government to account. We will strengthen the independence of the
House of Lords as an effective revising chamber by requiring new members
to be approved by an independent appointments commission. We will set up
a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament in order to seek consensus
on lasting reform in the House of Lords. We would like to see a stronger
House of Lords in the future, including a substantial elected element.

Conservatives will support reforms of the House of Commons to make
ministers more accountable. As a first step we will once again require the
Prime Minister to appear before the House of Commons twice a week, and
make sure that Select Committees are independent of party managers.

We reaffirm our commitment to keeping Britain's voting system for general
elections.

As a Unionist party, we value the contribution that Northern Ireland makes
to the United Kingdom. Conservatives have always upheld the principle that
the future of Northern Ireland will be determined solely by democracy and
consent and never by violence. The next Conservative Government will
resolutely maintain Northern Ireland's position within the United Kingdom,
in accordance with the democratically expressed wishes of the greater
number of its people.

Conservatives continue to believe that the Belfast Agreement offers the best
chance for lasting peace and political stability. The key to progress is
maintaining confidence on all sides. So the next Conservative Government
will work tirelessly and constructively to bring about the full implementation
of all aspects of the Agreement, including the decommissioning of illegally-
held terrorist arms and explosives.

We remain unstinting in our praise for the work of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary and the armed forces in fighting terrorism. Improvements to
the overall security situation will inevitably bring about changes, but
reductions in security will only be made on the basis of the prevailing
terrorist threat. Conservatives will not countenance any measure that
weakens the ability of the police and army to uphold the rule of law and
protect the people of Northern Ireland against terrorism.

Restoring faith in politics

At a time when the Government has interfered as never before in everyone's
lives, they have abandoned any pretence of accountability. No wonder the
British people have become disillusioned with politicians.

We want to return to people responsibility for their lives by reducing the
level of political interference and regulation. And that involves reducing the
number of politicians.

We will abandon the Government's plans for a new tier of regional

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/2001/2001-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 36 of 37

2001 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

politicians in England. We will cut the number of government ministers and,
once we have strengthened parliamentary scrutiny, we will reduce the size of
the House of Commons.

And we will cut the number of political advisers and spin doctors employed,
at the taxpayer's expense, to serve government ministers.

Time To Deliver

Conservatives have a vision of what our country can be when it is true to its
own character.

We want strong families and enterprising business. We want a free and
responsible society. We want to govern ourselves, confident in a stable and
trusted constitution. This manifesto sets out the vision that will inspire the
next Conservative Government.

It's time for a Government that will deliver.

It's time to support marriage and the family; time for a war on crime; time to
cut taxes and regulation; time for our schools and hospitals to benefit from
choice and freedom; time to show respect to our pensioners; time for real
savings not welfare dependency; time to endow our universities; time to
rebuild our inner cities; time to end the crisis in the countryside; time to be
in Europe, but not run by it.

It's time for common sense.

1997 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

You can only be sure with the Conservatives

Foreword

The Conservative administrations elected since 1979 are among the most
successful in British peacetime history. A country once the sick man of
Europe has become its most successful economy. A country once brought to
its knees by over-mighty trade unions now has industrial peace. Abroad, the
cold war has been won; at home, the rule of law has been restored. The
enterprising virtues of the British people have been liberated from the dead
hand of the state. There can be no doubt that we have created a better
Britain.

Why, then, do we still need a Conservative Government? Because resting on
what we have achieved is not enough. To stand still is to fall back. Our goal
must be for Britain to be the best place in the world to live.

We live in a tougher, more uncertain world. A fast-moving global free
market is emerging. New economic powers are rising in the East. Family life
and social attitudes are changing. Europe is adjusting to the end of
communism. The European social model is failing. The nation state is under
threat. We must respond to these challenges.

We have turned around our economic fortunes. We have fewer people out of
work and more in work than any other major European economy. British
people now have the opportunity of a prosperous future. But that prosperity
cannot be taken for granted. We have to compete to win. That means a
constant fight to keep tight control over public spending and enable Britain
to remain the lowest taxed major economy in Europe. It means a continuing
fight to keep burdens off business, maintaining our opt-out of the European
Social Chapter. If we relax for one moment, our hard won success will slip
away again.

We have strengthened choice and personal ownership for families, and
rolled back the state from areas where it was interfering unnecessarily in our
lives. But we now have the opportunity to achieve a massive expansion in
wealth and ownership so that more families can enjoy the self-respect and
independence that comes with being self-sufficient from the state. Our far-
reaching proposals for personal pension funds are central to achieving this -
so too are our plans to increase support for the family in our tax system. Our

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

aim is to spread opportunity for all to succeed, whoever they are and
wherever they come from, provided they are prepared to work hard. To turn
the ""have nots"" into the ""haves"". To support the family in providing security
and stability.

We have modernised and reformed many of the areas where the state still
has a vital role. But we now have to build on these reforms to deliver even
better services. We must continue providing the resources to invest in our
modernised health service. We can now provide parents with a hard-edged
guarantee of standards in schools. We need also to widen choice in areas
where state bureaucracy has constrained it.

We have pioneered new ways of building partnerships that engage the
private sector in areas previously dependent on the public purse. We now
need to capture private sector investment on a massive scale to regenerate
our cities, transform our crumbling local authority housing estates and
modernise other public assets.

The only way to secure this future of opportunity is to stick with the
Conservative programme of continuing reform. Now would be the worst
possible moment to abandon the pathway to prosperity on which we are set.
We must keep up the momentum.

At the same time we must maintain the security that a stable nation provides
in an uncertain, fast-changing world. We must protect our constitution and
unity as a nation from those who threaten it with unnecessary and dangerous
change. And we must stand up for our interests in shaping a free-market
Europe of sovereign nation states.

There is, of course, an alternative on offer: to load costs on business while
calling it ""stakeholding""; to increase the role of the state, while calling it ""the
community""; to succumb to a centralised Europe while calling it ""not being
isolated""; to break up our country while calling it ""devolution"".

To risk this alternative would be a disaster for our country. We have come a
very long way. We must be sure that we do not throw away what we have
gained, or lose the opportunities we have earned.

Our Record

¢ The UK is on course to grow faster than both France and Germany for
the sixth successive year in 1998 - a post-war record.

¢ Inflation has now been below 4% for well over 4 years, the longest
period of low inflation for almost half a century.

¢ Mortgage rates are at their lowest levels for 30 years.

¢ Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level for 6 years. We now have

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

a lower unemployment rate than any other major European economy.
Youth unemployment in Britain has fallen to less than 15% whereas
by contrast, in France it has risen to 27% and in Italy to 33%.

¢ Ahigher proportion of our people are in work than in any other major
European economy - 68% against a Continental average of 57%.

¢ The UK is the favourite location for inward investment into Europe,
attracting around one third of inward investment into the European
Union.

e We have the lowest tax burden of any major European economy, with
the government taking almost 8% less of national income than the
European average.

e Public borrowing has averaged 3.4% of GDP since 1919 compared
with 6.8% (and a peak of 9.5%) under the last Labour Government.
Our level of public debt is now one of the lowest in the European
Union - whereas it was one of the highest in 1979.

e In 1994 the UK lost 300,000 working days through strikes, the lowest
figure ever recorded; in 1979 the figure was 29,500,000: nearly 100
times that figure.

¢ Britain ranks fifth in the world in international trade, and exports more
per head than America or Japan. Exports account for 28% of GDP as
against 9% for Japan, 11 % for USA and 24% for Germany and
France. Britain's current account is broadly in balance, reflecting our
increased competitiveness and improved trading.

1. Doubling Living Standards

The free market is winning the battle of ideas the world over. From Russia to
Vietnam, from China to Romania, people are realising that the socialist
model has failed. This is not just an economic triumph. It is a triumph for
human freedom. Britain helped to secure it. We should take pride in it.

The spread of the free market heralds a new age of global competition. That
means new markets for British goods and services, but new competitors for
British companies as well.

If we try to protect ourselves from these challenges with more regulations,
public subsidies and a cosy dependence on government then Britain will fail.
But if we boldly embrace these new opportunities by pushing forward the
economic revolution we began in 1979, then we will enter the next
millennium with boundless prospects for growth and prosperity.

That choice - between stagnation and dynamism - is the choice which faces
Britain at this election. It is a stark choice between the British way - of
trusting the people and unleashing enterprise - and the failing social model,
practised on the continent, which the Labour Party wants to impose on us
here under the guise of ""stakeholding"".

Hard economic evidence shows how great is the divide between these two
strategies. Britain is now in its fifth year of growing faster than France or
Germany. Unemployment in Britain has fallen to less than two million,
while it rises across Europe. Britain attracts nearly forty per cent of all the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

American and Japanese investment in Europe. Our aim now is to safeguard
these achievements and build on them, so Britain becomes the unrivalled
Enterprise Centre of Europe.

A Low Tax Economy

For enterprise to flourish, the state must get out of the way of the wealth
creators. We are the only party that can cut taxes because we are the only
party which is serious about controlling public spending. The choice
between the two economic philosophies is clean In the years before 1979,
public spending in Britain kept pace with the average for Europe as a whole.
Since then, it has continued rising on the continent, while we have restrained
public spending here. Now, public spending takes about 40% of our national
income as against an average of 50% on the continent. We have broken free
from a trend in which the rest of Europe is still trapped.

Conservative government will keep public spending under tight control and
ensure that it grows by less than the economy as a whole over the economic
cycle. At the same time we will continue to spend more on the services
which matter most to people - hospitals, schools and the police.

Over the next parliament, we will achieve our goal for the government to
spend less than 40% of our national income.

That means we can reduce the amount government borrows too, and meet
our aim of moving towards a balanced budget in the medium term. Our
plans show how we can virtually eliminate public borrowing by the year
2000.

Thanks to our success in controlling public spending, Britain is now
Europe's low tax economy. This is one of the reasons why we are becoming
the Enterprise Centre of Europe.

Our aim is to ensure Britain keeps the lowest tax burden of any major
European economy.

In the election manifesto of 1992, we promised that ""We will make further
progress towards a basic income tax rate of 20p"". Since then, we have cut
the basic rate of income tax from 25p to 23p, and extended the 20p band so
that over a quarter of all taxpayers now only pay income tax at the 20p rate.
Achieving our public expenditure goals will mean we can sustain
permanently low tax levels.

Over the next parliament, our aim will be to achieve our target of a 20p
basic rate of income tax, while maintaining a maximum tax rate of no more
than 40p.

Stable Prices

Inflation has to be kept firmly under control for an economy to thrive.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Britain is now enjoying the longest period of stable prices for almost fifty
years. We are on target to reach our goal of 2.5% inflation this year.

Low inflation has delivered lower interest rates whilst preserving the value
of people's savings. Homeowners are now enjoying mortgage rates at the
lowest levels for 30 years.

It has taken tough decisions to break free from our reputation as a high
inflation economy. No Conservative government will jeopardise this
achievement.

During the next parliament, we will maintain an inflation target of 2.5% or
less.

Rising Living Standards

The only secure base for rising living standards is a strongly growing
economy, low levels of public spending and taxation, and stable prices. That
is exactly what Britain is achieving. People are reaping the rewards of their
hard work as their take home pay increases. Between 1974 and 1979, the
take home pay for a family on average earnings rose, in real terms, by just
£1 a week in today's prices. Since 1979 it has increased by £100 a week; this
year alone it will increase by £7 a week.

The goal which we set ourselves in 1995 is to double living standards over
25 years.

We are on course to achieve our goal.

>2. Jobs and Business

Our priority is to create jobs. This is not just an economic priority, but also a
social and moral one. Jobs and enterprise are the best ways of tackling
poverty and deprivation.

Britain is succeeding. 900,000 jobs have been created over the past 4 years.
By contrast the European social model is stifling job creation on the
continent by imposing regulations and burdens on business. In the United
Kingdom unemployment is much lower than in the rest of Europe and
falling whereas in Germany, France, and Italy it has risen to its highest level
for a generation. This is no accident. It is because we have pursued very
different policies from those on the Continent.

Curbing the power of trade unions, opening up markets and cutting red tape,
have given us a low strike, low cost economy: and as a result Britain is the
number one location for foreign investment in Europe.

Never have such policies been so important. For the first time this century
we face a world full of capitalist competition. The only way Britain will be
able to compete and win in world markets is by sticking to the Conservative
policies that are delivering success. We can earn prosperity as one of the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

world's most successful global trading nations. We should not risk this
progress by adopting the very policies that have made the continent
uncompetitive and have increased unemployment in Europe by 4.5 million
over the past 5 years.

Small Businesses - Britain's Risk-takers

Governments do not create jobs. Businesses do. The source of tomorrow's
jobs will be small businesses, the seedcorn of Britain's prosperity. Over the
last 15 years, small businesses have created over 2 million jobs. By the year
2000, over half the workforce should be working in companies which
employ fewer than 50 people. Back in 1979 only a third of the workforce
did.

Entrepreneurs often risk everything when they set up their own business. We
have already helped them: raising the VAT threshold, cutting employer's
national insurance contributions, simplifying audit requirements and much
more besides. Now we intend to go further, tackling the remaining problems
they face.

High taxes and rates deter enterprise. Our low tax structure has been crucial
to our industrial revival. We already have the lowest corporation tax of any
major industrialised country. As we want small businesses to flourish, we
will go even further.

We will cut the small companies rate of corporation tax in line with personal
taxation as we move towards a 20p basic rate

Investment and enterprise are deterred if the taxman takes too much of the
capital that is built up by a successful business. Capital is ever more mobile,
flying around the world to places where the tax on it is low: Britain must be
one of those places.

We will continue to reduce the burden of capital gains tax and inheritance
tax as it is prudent to do so.

One of the heaviest burdens small businesses face is business rates. At the
moment, this bears more heavily upon small businesses than large ones.

In the next parliament, we will reform business rates to reduce the cost that
falls upon small businesses.

No businessman has time to fill out reams of forms. We will continue to
simplify the administration of NICs and PAYE for small firms, allowing
them to concentrate on satisfying customers not bureaucrats. We are also
tackling a problem that hits small businesses particularly hard - the late
payment of bills. On top of our programme to ensure government
departments and local authorities pay on time we have legislated to require
companies to publish their payment policy and to report their record on how
quickly they pay their bills to small businesses.

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We have already abolished over a thousand regulations. New regulations
must only be introduced if it is clear that their benefits exceed their costs and
they do not place an undue burden on a small firm.

We will introduce ""sunset"" requirements into new regulations whenever
appropriate so that they are automatically reviewed or dropped after a
specific period.

Many businessmen suffer regulatory burdens imposed by local government
and quangos.

We will therefore insist that the whole of the public sector adopts the same
stringent rules that we require of central government in justifying the
benefits of new regulations against their costs.

Reducing the Burden on Companies

Jobs depend on British firms winning orders: the difference between success
or failure can be wafer-thin. Any extra burden on business will destroy jobs.

Britain is enjoying more jobs and record investment, thanks to the
competitive edge we have over other European countries. We are a low cost
economy But that does not mean we are a low pay economy. Our
competitive advantage comes from the lower costs facing our businesses. It
can be measured by the social costs an employer has to pay on top of every
£100 of wages: in Germany it is £31, in France £41, but in Britain, it is only
£15.

Many countries in Europe have tried to cocoon themselves from global
competition behind layers of red tape and regulation - such as the Social
Chapter and a national minimum wage. This provides a false sense of
security, playing a cruel trick on working people. It also excludes the
unemployed from work. As companies in the rest of Europe have grown
more uncompetitive, employers have found it too expensive to employ new
workers, investment has gone elsewhere, and the dole queues have
lengthened. The European social model is not social and not a model for us
to follow. But if Britain signed up to the Social Chapter it would be used to
impose that model on us - destroying British jobs.

No Conservative government will sign up to the Social Chapter or introduce
a national minimum wage We will insist at the Intergovernmental
Conference in Amsterdam that our opt-out is honoured and that Britain is
exempted from the Working Time Directive: if old agreements are broken, we
do not see how new ones can be made

We will resist the imposition of other social burdens on the work place
through a new European employment chapter.

Welfare into Work

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Although governments cannot create jobs, they can help people train and
find work. We now have in place a battery of schemes working with
Training and Enterprise Councils to provide targeted help and training,
including remedial education in literacy and numeracy. We are also
developing new incentives, alongside Family Credit, to help people move off
benefit into work.

We will always help those in genuine need: in return, the unemployed have a
responsibility to look for work and accept a reasonable offer That belief
underpins our new Jobseeker's Allowance which ensures that no-one can
refuse reasonable work opportunities and remain on benefit.

As unemployment falls, we want to focus on those who have been
unemployed for some time. At present, Project Work is helping 100,000
people who have been unemployed for more than 2 years in cities around
Britain. They are first given help in finding a job - which includes giving
employers incentives to take them on. Those who do not find jobs are then
required to work for a specific period on a community project. This helps
them regain work habits and ensures they are available for work.

As Project Work succeeds and demonstrates that its costs can be met by the
savings from getting people into work, we will extend the programme to
cover the long-term unemployed nationwide

We will also develop an innovative ""Britain Works"" scheme which uses the
experience and ingenuity of private and voluntary sectors to get people off
welfare into work.

Britain has one of the most mobile economies in Europe. People move on,
and up, into better paid jobs more easily than on the continent.

The Information Society

Britain is at the forefront of creating tomorrow's information society Already
we have exposed domestic telecommunications to competition and
stimulated investment in cable and satellite entertainment systems. And by
opening up international telecommunications we will continue to encourage
companies worldwide to base their global operations here. We will make
sure that the digital revolution comes to Britain first.

We are launching an ambitious programme with industry to spread ""IT for
All"", giving every adult the opportunity to try out and learn about new IT
services. We will work with industry to ensure that all schools are connected
to the information superhighway.

We will use the Millennium Lottery Fund to transform the computer facilities
and information links available in schools, libraries, museums, voluntary

organisations and other public places after the turn of the century.

This will give the public much wider access to information services in the
years ahead. We will also take advantage of information technology to

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

transform the way government provides services to the public.

We will keep Britain in the vanguard of new mobile service development -
including mobile telephone and information services - by introducing a
pricing system for the radio spectrum to achieve more efficient allocation of
radio frequencies.

We will maintain a strong, free and competitive broadcasting and press
environment at both national and local level, while continuing to be vigilant
in monitoring whether action is needed to curb breaches of standards, and
prevent unacceptable press intrusion.

Science

British science enjoys a worldwide reputation for excellence and cost-
effectiveness, which makes Britain an attractive base for many domestic and
overseas companies. We will continue to invest in science and target funds at
basic research, which would not otherwise be funded by industry. At the
same time we will provide an enterprising environment which encourages
firms to invest with confidence in applied science.

2020 Vision

There is no part of the globe which has not been reached by British
enterprise and British culture. We have always looked out beyond these
shores, beyond this continent. Our language, our heritage of international
trading links, our foreign investments - second only to America's - are
historic strengths which mean we are ideally placed to seize the
opportunities of the global economy.

Thanks to Conservative policies of liberalisation and privatisation we are
strong in industries of the future such as telecommunications, financial
services, and information technology. These are the industries that will
benefit from opening up trade around the world. We will push for
completion of the European Single Market and continue to pursue the
objective of transatlantic free trade against the background of world trade
liberalisation.

Our aim is nothing less than tariff free trade across the globe by the year
2020

Free competition is important for free markets. Companies should not make
agreements that restrict competition and hence result in poor value for
consumers. We have set out proposals to give companies greater protection
against price fixing, dumping, and other restrictive practices by larger
competitors.

We will introduce a Competition Bill to take forward these proposals in the
first session of the next parliament

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We are committed to pushing forward our competitiveness agenda which is
making Britain the Enterprise Centre of Europe.

Opportunity and Ownership for Individuals
and Families

Our Record - Opportunity

¢ The right to buy has allowed 1.5 million council tenants to become
homeowners. There are over 4 million more homeowners today than
in 1979.

¢ The Government has spent £6 billion through housing associations to
provide homes for rent. Between 1992 and 1995 housing associations
provided 178,000 new lettings - 25,000 more than promised in the
1992 Manifesto.

¢ There are now around 10 million private shareholders, up from about
3 million at the time of the last Labour government. 2.5 million people
now have tax free savings in PEP accounts, and 4.5 million in
TESSAs.

¢ Since 1979, the success of private pension provision has raised the
average income of pensioners by 60% more than inflation. Almost
90% of recently retired pensioners now have incomes over and above
state benefits.

¢ Savings in private pension funds have increased to £650 billion - more
than 4 times the level in 1979. Their value is greater than the pension
funds in all other EU countries added together.

¢ Over the period 1979 to 1995, education spending per pupil rose from
£515 to £1,890 - an increase in real terms of 48%. Real spending on
books and equipment per pupil rose 56%. Teachers' real pay rose 57%:
from £270 per week in 1979 to £420 in 1995.

¢ In 1979, 40% of three and four year olds attended nursery school; in
1995 the figure was 59%. Our nursery vouchers now give this
opportunity to every child.

¢ The proportion of sixteen year olds staying on in full-time education
rose from 4 out of 10 in 1979 to 7 out of 10 in 1995.

¢ Almost 1 in 3 young people now go on to university, compared with |
in 8 in 1979.

¢ The proportion of adults with no academic qualifications has halved
since 1979 and the proportion of adults with a degree or equivalent
has more than doubled rising from 5% to 12%.

3. Choice and Security for Families

The family is the most important institution in our lives. It offers security
and stability in a fast-changing world. But the family is undermined if
governments take decisions which families ought to take for themselves.
Self-reliance underpins freedom and choice.

Families are stronger if they have the money to look after themselves: that is

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

why we are shifting power and wealth back to working families and away
from the state. We have already achieved much - the average family's
disposable income has gone up by 40% since 1979. But we want to go
further. The next Conservative government intends to reform the tax system
so that it gives substantially more help to families.

We also want to encourage people to save so they have the security and self-
respect that comes from being able to rely on their own resources rather than
immediately turning to the state. We have already made much progress here
too with widening ownership of homes, pensions, and the new PEPs and
TESSAs. We now propose further radical measures for more saving for
retirement.

Families and Tax

We believe families should be left with as much of their own money as
possible. They know better than politicians how to spend it. We have already
cut the basic rate of income tax from 33p to 23p, and our aim is to get it
down to 20p, benefitting 18 million taxpayers. We intend to do even more to
help families in particular.

At the moment, if one spouse does not take paid work in order to look after
children or dependent relatives, they not only give up earnings but may also
be unable to benefit from their personal tax allowance. Yet this is the time at
which their income is often most stretched.

We believe our tax system should recognise and support the crucial role of
families in their caring responsibilities. We will give them that support.

We will give priority to future reductions in personal taxation that help
families looking after dependent children or relatives by allowing one
partner's unused personal allowance to be transferred to a working spouse
where they have these responsibilities.

This will provide a targeted reduction in the tax bill to those families who
need it most. Around 2 million one-taxpayer couples with dependent
children, or looking after elderly relatives and others needing care, would
gain up to £17.50 a week - around £900 a year.

Family Savings

In the old days people just depended on the weekly pay packet or money
from the state. But no job can be secure and the state cannot provide for
every eventuality. It is ownership which brings true security and genuine
independence from the state. That is why Conservatives have long dreamed
of a property-owning democracy. Now we are delivering it in practice.
Home ownership is up by 4.7 million. 10 million people own a direct
personal stake in our economy. 16 million are gaining shares in their
building societies thanks to our deregulation of them. We intend to carry
forward our vision of a people's share. This is a significant increase in

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

personal security. It is the Conservative vision of security through personal
savings - not a socialist vision of security through the state.

We want people to enjoy Britain's success - especially by owning shares in
the companies for which they work. We have already introduced a number
of schemes to encourage employee share ownership. To encourage a further
expansion of worker shares, our new Share Match Scheme will allow
employees to be rewarded with additional free shares if they acquire a stake
in their company.

Our goal is that by 2000, more than half of the employees of Britain's
larger companies will own shares in those companies.

Four and a half million people now benefit from tax free TESSAs and 2.5
million from PEP schemes to encourage the accumulation of long term
saving. We will continue to build on this success by exploring ways in which
existing tax exemptions for savings can be developed - allowing individuals
to secure their future and protect their families against unexpected
contingencies.

We will continue to raise the threshold for inheritance tax as it is prudent
to do so.

People are not just saving for themselves but for their children and grand-
children. These savings should not be penalised by the tax system.

For many people their biggest asset is their pension. Thanks to the steps we
have already taken to encourage occupational and personal pensions, we
now have £650 billion invested in private pensions - more than the rest of
the European Union put together We now plan to build further on this
achievement.

We will make it easier for small employers to set up personal pension plans
for groups of employees.

We will create more flexibility for people who save in personal pension
plans to continue investing in those schemes if they subsequently move to
Jobs with company pension schemes.

We will also create flexibility for employees with savings in Additional
Voluntary Contributions (AVC) schemes to take part of that pension earlier
or later than their main company pension.

But we believe the time has now come to plan for another important step in
improving Britain's pension provision. Britain is already much better placed
than many other countries to afford state pensions in the future, but we want
even more people to be able to look forward to properly funded pension that
grows with the economy and is free from dependence on taxes paid by future
generations. We now propose a practical way of achieving a gradual
transformation of the state pension scheme.

At the start of the next parliament we will set out proposals to provide all

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

young people entering the workforce with a personal pension fund paid for
through a rebate on their national insurance contributions. At retirement
they would be entitled to the full pension earned by this accumulated
investment. This could give them a pension significantly higher than they
would currently receive from the state. But they will be guaranteed a
pension at least equal to the current bask state pension, increased in line
with inflation.

This will be one of the most significant improvements in the state pension
system since it was introduced.

Older people currently in the workforce would be unaffected - they will
continue to contribute as now and receive the normal state pension when
they retire.

This policy would come into effect early in the new millennium. Gradual
phasing in of the new system over 40 years will make the impact on public
finances affordable. Even at its peak, the net revenue forgone will be only a
fraction of the savings from the recent Pensions Act. And eventually, the
new policy will produce massive public expenditure savings.

This far-sighted idea is in the best Conservative tradition. The growing
wealth of the nation will provide for the next generation through private
funding, underpinned by a state guarantee. British people will be able to
look forward to retirement with even greater confidence. And our young
people will have a pensions opportunity unrivalled in the world.

Support for Families

Conservatives believe that a healthy society encourages people to accept
responsibility for their own lives. A heavy-handed and intrusive state can do
enormous damage.

Some families need help to cope with their responsibilities. For them, Social
Services play a vital role. They help with children where parental care has
failed. They deliver an ever wider range of services to people with learning
difficulties or who are mentally ill. Our community care reforms have given
them a central role ensuring that elderly people get care of the highest
quality: and in their own homes where possible. We need to ensure that role
is properly fulfilled.

Early in the next Parliament we will introduce a Social Services Reform Bill
which will create a new statutory framework for social services. The Bill
will provide for greater openness and accountability in social services.

We will provide new guidance to ensure social workers properly reflect the
values of the community - focusing their efforts on those families who
most need support, and minimising unnecessary interference. Social
workers working with children will receive special training to cope with
the often heart-rending cases they face.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We will raise standards through a new regulatory framework which will
apply the same standards in both the public and private sector.

We will also remove the power of local authorities to operate care homes
where this is in the best interests of the people for whom they are
responsible.

We believe that families who use social services should be able to exercise
choice wherever practicable. We have given cash payments to disabled
people to purchase the services they need directly.

We also want new ways of reinforcing individual choice where possible. We
will therefore ensure no barriers stand in the way of local authorities wanting
to issue their users with vouchers to buy certain services.

We will review the direct payment scheme, and provided it has been cost
effective, we will extend it to other users of social services.

Above all, we want to help families to help themselves. Caring for older - or
disabled - relatives is one of the most natural human instincts. We recognise
the crucial and often demanding role carers play, and will help them more.

We will introduce a Respite Care Programme. This will enable family
members with heavy responsibilities caring for a relative to take a much
needed break. We will also offer more practical advice for carers who want
to go back to paid work.

But in some cases, elderly people need more care than their friends or
relatives can provide. Financing long term care worries many families. We
will create an imaginative, fair partnership between individuals and the
public sector to resolve this problem.

In the first session of the next Parliament we will implement our
partnership scheme for long term care, making it easier for people to
afford the cost of care in old age without giving up their lifetime savings.

Good preparation for marriage can be an important aid to a successful
family, while timely help in meeting difficulties can often avoid family
breakdown. These are matters for voluntary effort, not the state, but we will
continue to support such effort.

We need to make sure efforts to help struggling families does not turn into
unnecessary meddling.

When the state goes too far, it is often the children who suffer They become
victims of the worst sort of political correctness.

We will introduce legislation to remove unnecessary barriers to adoption
and introduce new rules to make adoption from abroad more
straightforward.

We will also monitor the workings of the Children Act, and act if necessary

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 14 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

to ensure it maintains a proper balance between the rights of children and
the responsibilities of adults.

Social Services departments are now the fourth arm of the welfare state.
Most people will need them at some point in their lives. We will ensure that
the Conservative revolution in public services now reaches Social Services.

Disabled People

We have quadrupled real spending on long term sick and disabled people
since 1979, to £22 billion.

We have introduced the Disability Discrimination Act. This is the first
legislation of its kind anywhere in Europe and it provides positive proof of
our commitment to disabled people. We will monitor it to ensure it continues
to meet its objectives.

We are also providing a continuing fund to enable the most severely disabled
people to stay in their own homes.

Security in Retirement

Pensioners continue to make a positive contribution to society in retirement.
They give more of their time in charitable work than any other age group.
They lift some of the pressures on their own families. They help keep our
nation's history and traditions alive.

They have paid their National Insurance contributions and taxes and rightly
expect us to continue to protect the value of the basic state pension against
price rises. We will do so. We will also ensure that less well off pensioners
continue to get extra help on top of the b asic pension.

At the same time as protecting the state pension, our encouragement of
private pensions is already transforming the living standards of pensioners.
The average net income of pensioners has risen by 60% since 1979. This has
been achieved by our encouragement of saving for retirement.

The tax system must help pensioners who have saved. Our new lower 20p
rate on income from savings directly helps 1.7 million pensioners and the
special age allowances raise the point at which pensioners start to pay
income tax.

A Better Social Security System

People in need can rely on our continuing support. To ensure that taxpayers
are willing to go on paying for that support, we have shaped a social security
system we can afford, taking a steadily declining share of our national
income. We are doing this by focusing benefits on those most in need,
helping people off welfare and into work, and curbing welfare fraud. These
policies are underpinned by our measures to help families help themselves.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 15 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Social Security must be there to help families, pensioners and people in
need. We will protect the value of Child Benefit and Family Credit which
help with the cost of bringing up children. This is our Family Benefits
Guarantee.

We will bring the structure of benefits for lone parents into line with that for
two-parent families. We will continue to help lone parents obtain
maintenance, and assist with childcare in work: both these measures help
lone parents obtain work. We will pilot our ""Parent Plus"" Scheme that gives
special help to lone parents who want to work, and extend it if it proves
successful.

Social Security fraud must be stamped out.

We will intensify our current initiatives of inspections and checks,
including more home visits, to crack down further on benefit cheats. We
will introduce benefit cards across the country. We will establish a Benefit
Fraud inspectorate to monitor local authorities' performance. We will also
improve the sharing of information between government departments to
catch more fraudulent claims.

To ensure as much of the Social Security budget as possible goes into
benefits, we will continue to improve the efficiency of administration, using
the best mix of public and private sector operations.

Housing

Owning one's own home is an aim shared by millions of people. Over the
last 18 years, the number of homeowners has increased by 4.7 million -
including 1.7 million who have bought their home under the right to buy
scheme. Over the next 10 years, we expect to see another one and a half
million people buying their own homes - some 3,000 every week. To meet
that demand, we will continue to allow local authority and housing
association tenants to buy their homes, or move to houses which they buy.

We will also carry through our draft Bill, creating the option for those
buying flats to choose a new form of commonhold ownership.

For those who wish to rent their home, we are encouraging a thriving private
rental market, building on the success of housing investment trusts and
protecting assured tenancies.

Easier renting will help us meet our target of reducing the proportion of
empty homes below 3%. The number of empty houses has fallen in each of
the last 3 years. But nothing is more frustrating for people who need social
housing, than the sight of a suitable property owned by the public sector
boarded up and empty. We will stop that.

Public landlords will have to sell houses which are available for

occupation yet have been left empty without a good reason for more than
12 months.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Housing associations and housing companies will continue to receive help in
building new homes, and we will encourage more public-private
partnerships. Together, these policies will help meet the demand for new
public housing and make sure that there are decent homes for those in need.

Opportunities for Women

Women are succeeding in Britain. More women have jobs in Britain than in
almost any other European country. Women have a better education, more
financial independence and more opportunities than at any other time in
Britain's history.

This success reflects the efforts and determination of many women.
Government's role has been simpler - to level up the playing field, whether
in education, where girls are now doing better than boys, or in the
workplace, where opportunities for women are the best in Europe.

But we know our job is not yet done. Some women still face barriers to
doing well. Some still do not have the financial security they deserve. And
crime, and the fear of crime, often affect women more than men.

We will ensure women have equal opportunities in education and the
workplace. This can best be achieved by keeping our economy buoyant and
our labour markets flexible. And our proposals to bring crime rates down
further will help women especially.

But many women - and some men - face a particular problem: how to juggle
job and family. For those who need or want to work, we will seek further
ways to minimise the barriers to affordable, high quality childcare. For those
who wish to be full-time parents, our proposals to enable them to transfer
their unused personal allowance to their spouse will be worth up to an extra
£17.50 a week.

We also want to give women more financial independence, particularly when
they retire. We propose, as explained elsewhere, to improve flexibility in
saving for retirement and to allow courts to split pensions on divorce.

Looking Outwards

The spread of share ownership, the transformation of pension provision, and
the sale of council houses are revolutionising our nation. Personal prosperity
and property ownership are not selfish or inward-looking.

People who are secure at home can look out for others in their community.
Over two thirds of adults engage in some form of voluntary activity. By the
end of 1997 all young people aged between 15 and 25 who want to volunteer
will be helped to find an opportunity to do so.

We will make it easier for those receiving incapacity benefit to volunteer by
removing the 16 hour weekly limit on their voluntary work.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We will encourage voluntary work by others living on benefit while
continuing to insist that those who are capable of work should actively seek
employment. We will also develop accreditation for voluntary work to
encourage employers to see it as preparation for a paid job.

It is wrong to imagine that compassion must be nationalised and that we can
only help our fellow man through state action.

4. Education and Opportunity

All children dream of what they might do when they grow up. Our task is to
help them turn those dreams into reality whatever their background may be.
It is an exciting world, full of new opportunities for inquiring minds: it
should be open to every child. Their future - and Britain's prosperity -
depends on the quality of their education.

Our Education Guarantee

A good education is the birthright of every child. Literacy is the building
block of all future learning: English is the global language of commerce and,
much more, a thing of beauty. Without basic science and mathematics, the
modern world is incomprehensible. Every child therefore must be taught to
read, write and add up from an early age.

Years of mistaken, progressive education in the 1960s and 1970s denied
these precious skills to too many children. We have worked ceaselessly since
1979 to put that right. Our decision to test children and publish the results
has allowed standards to be measured and exposed. We have reformed the
curriculum, toughened inspections, and given more information and power
to parents. Our many excellent teachers now know what is expected of them,
and already standards in schools are rising. But they are still not good
enough. We must do more.

Building on what we have done, we can now offer a new pledge to parents -
a guarantee of education standards.

First, we will set national targets for school performance that reflect our
objective of ensuring that Britain is in the top league of international
standards across the whole spectrum of education.

Second, we will require every school to plan how to improve its
performance, and to set targets which relate to similar schools and
national standards.

Third, we will give all parents full information on the performance of their
child's school

Fourth, to underwrite our pledge, we will ensure action is taken to bring
any under-performing school up to the mark.

We will meet this pledge by using the full set of levers for improved

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 18 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

standards that we have put in place.

We are revising and simplifying the National Curriculum in primary schools
to emphasise high standards in the basic skills.

Parents and teachers must have an overview of not just how much a child
has learnt while at school, but how the school performs against others. Poor
schooling must not be protected by a veil of secrecy. Parent power is a vital
force for higher standards.

Regular tests and exams are essential if teachers are to discover how much
their pupils have learnt, and parents are to know how much progress their
children are making against national standards. That is why children are
already being tested at 7, 11 and 14.

We will publish all school test results, including the results of tests of 7 and
14 year olds.

We propose also to assess every child at five.

This will give teachers and parents a benchmark against which they can
measure future progress. To give a better measure of pupil's performance,
marks out of 100 will be made available to parents as well as the broad-
brush levels.

We will also introduce a new test for 14 year old children that covers the
whole National Curriculum - assessing progress before they choose
subjects for GCSE.

Tests and exams need to be rigorous and demanding. We will insist that they
establish children's command of spelling, punctuation, and grammar in
English tests. Children will sit arithmetic tests without calculators. We will
not allow such extensive use of open books in tests and in GCSE exams. We
will establish an English Language GCSE. We will continue to uphold the
gold standard of A-levels, and ensure that the great classics of our literature
are studied at A-level. At the same time students should have the chance to
study more subjects in the sixth form.

Rigorous tests show how individual children and schools are performing and
expose schools that are not giving children the education they deserve. To
underwrite our guarantee, we will then take action to improve standards. We
cannot tolerate schools that fail their pupils.

By this summer every secondary school in the country will have been
inspected by independent inspectors, and by summer 1998, every primary
school will have been inspected as well. We have the power to take over
failing schools directly and close them if necessary We will now go further
and require every school to set, and publish, regular targets, and plans for
improving their academic results. Independent inspectors will monitor the
results of weaker schools and their plans for improvement at regular
intervals.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 19 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Sometimes, though, schools are failing because the local education authority
which runs them is failing. The authorities with the worst GCSE results and
the worst results at Key Stage 2 (11 year olds) are run by Labour. Those
children need our help.

We will allow for on independent inspection of education authorities and
intervene directly to raise standards where education authorities are letting
children down.

Failing authorities will be required to set out their plans to raise standards,
and work with education teams - directed by independent inspectors - to
implement those plans.

The vast majority of teachers do an outstanding job. They have played a key
part in implementing the reforms that we have introduced. A few, though, let
their pupils down.

We will establish a more rigorous and effective system of appraising
teachers, which reflects how well their pupils perform in tests and exams:
this will identify which teachers need more help and, where necessary,
which teachers need to be replaced.

Many feel that the professional standing of teachers would be strengthened
by the creation of a single body which could speak with authority on
professional standards. We will consult with teachers and other interested
parties about the possible role of such a body.

The school should be a place of stability and stimulation for children,
especially if they come from a hostile or turbulent environment. To improve
standards in future our new teacher training curriculum will stress traditional
teaching methods - including whole class teaching and learning to read by
the sounds of letters. We will also encourage more teachers to enter the
profession through practical training schemes focused on classroom
experience such as the Graduate Teacher Scheme. A child is likely to learn
more in a well-ordered school. Teachers must have the powers they need to
maintain discipline. We will give teachers greater power to set detentions, to
exclude disruptive pupils and to use reasonable physical restraint where
necessary.

Schools also have an important role to play in spiritual and moral education.

We will take steps to ensure that every school fulfils its role of providing
religious education and collective worship.

Choice and Diversity

When we came to power in 1979 the school system was totally dominated
by one type of school - the monolithic comprehensive. The system failed our
children. It treated every child the same. It told parents where to send their

children. It did not give schools the freedom to run their own affairs.

Since 1979 we have created a rich diversity of schools, to serve the varied

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 20 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

talents of all children and give parents choice within that diversity, because
we believe that parents know what is best for their children.

That is why we - and only we - are committed to giving the parent of every
four year old child a voucher for nursery education so they can choose the
pre-school education they want for their child, whether in a play-group, a
reception class, or a nursery school in the private or state sector.

We will give more talented children, from less well-off backgrounds, the
opportunity to go to fee-paying schools by expanding the Assisted Places
Scheme to cover all ages of compulsory education, in line with our current
spending plans. We propose to develop it further into a wider scholarship
scheme covering additional educational opportunities. The freedoms and
status of fee-paying schools will be protected.

Grant-maintained schools have been popular with parents across the country
- whatever their politics. We will encourage more schools to become grant-
maintained and will allow new grant-maintained schools to be set up where
there is sufficient local demand. We will give all grant-maintained schools
greater freedoms to expand and to select their pupils.

Grant-maintained schools are leading the way. Local authority schools are
also benefitting from our policy of local management of schools. Our
ultimate objective is that all schools should take full responsibility for the
management of their own affairs. In the next parliament we will take another
step towards giving them that freedom.

We will extend the benefits of greater self-governance to all LEA schools.
We will require local authorities to delegate more of schools' budgets to the
schools themselves. We will give them more freedom over the employment
of their staff and over admissions. And, where they want it, we will allow
them to take over ownership of their assets, so they can make best use of
the resources.

Local authorities will continue to be responsible for their schools' standards.
They will provide funds, and compete with other organisations to provide
services to schools. We would expect the increased responsibility of head-
teachers, and their role in achieving efficiency-savings, to be recognised by
their pay review body.

Schools are stronger and more effective where head-teachers and governors
can shape their own distinctive character Sometimes that means developing
a speciality in some subjects. Sometimes it means selecting children by their
aptitudes: where parents want this we should not stand in their way. Special
abilities should be recognised and encouraged.

We will continue to encourage the establishment of more specialist schools
in technology, arts, languages and sport. We aim to help one in five
schools become specialist schools by 2001.

We will allow all schools to select some of their pupils.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 21 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We will help schools to became grammar schools in every major town
where parents want that choke.

The high standards, real choice and genuine diversity which we have
introduced will produce the best results for all our children.

Lifetime Learning

Lifetime learning is a reality in Britain today. Over a half of all students in
universities, and seventy per cent of those in further education colleges, are
adults who have returned to education later in life. We will continue to create
new opportunities for more people to participate. There has been a
revolution in further and higher education. Three and a half million people
are in further education - up from just half a million in 1979. The number of
young people going to university has risen from one in eight to one in three
over the same period.

We will ensure consistently high standards and will consult on the
development of higher education when we receive the results of the Dearing
Review. We have world class research in British universities which we will
continue to support.

Every young person should have the opportunity to continue in education or
training.

We will give students between 14 and 21 a learning credit which will
enable them to choose suitable education or training leading to recognised
qualifications up to A levels or their equivalents.

We will also introduce National Traineeships and encourage employers to
offer more work-based Modern Apprenticeships to young people. Objective
external assessments of a proper syllabus will be made a part of all National
Vocational Qualifications.

We will continue to support the network of Training and Enterprise
Councils, which have created a valuable partnership between business and
government. We will encourage more employers to become involved in
""Investors in People"", with the public sector matching the performance of
the private sector.

Competitive markets demand high skills. If Britain is to win, we need to
encourage learning and give people the opportunity to go where their
interests and inquiring minds take them.

World Class Health and Public Services

Our Record - Health and Public Services

¢ Government spending has concentrated on priorities, not wasteful
bureaucracy and overmanning. Despite tough overall public spending

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 22 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

plans, real spending on the NHS has risen nearly 75% since 1979, on
schools by 50% and on the police by more than 100%.

¢ The Health Service is treating over 1 million more patients each year
than before our reforms.

¢ The number of people waiting over 12 months for hospital treatment
has fallen from over 200,000 in 1990 to 22,000 last year. The average
wait has fallen from nearly 9 months to 4 months.

¢ The Government has set up the Citizen's Charter to provide first class
public services for all citizens. Nearly 650 organisations have received
a Charter Mark for meeting demanding standards of performance,
customer satisfaction and value for money.

e There are now 55,000 more nurses and midwives and 22,500 more
doctors and dentists than in 1979. For every senior NHS manager, 77
people are providing direct patient care.

e Nurses average earnings have grown 70% in real terms: from £68 a
week in 1979 to £325 in 1995. Doctor's pay has risen by a third. Under
Labour both were cut.

¢ Infant mortality has fallen from 13.2 to 6.2 per thousand over the last
18 years.

¢ Deaths through road accidents are now the lowest since records began
in 1926. Since 1979 road deaths and serious casualties have fallen by
43% despite an 85% increase in motor traffic.

e The government has invested record amounts on transport - more than
£26 billion since 1979 in investment on motorways and trunk roads;
£16 billion in investment on railways; and £8 billion in investment on
London Transport.

¢ Privatisation is delivering better services at lower costs. BT's main
prices are down by more than 40% in real terms. Average household
bills for gas and electricity have also fallen in real terms since 1990.

5. Security in Health

We have been the guardians of the NHS for most of its life, improving its
services and securing its funding. The benefits can be seen in our rising
standards of health. 1993 was for example the first year in which no child in
this country died of measles. Between 1979 and 1995 life expectancy at birth
in England has increased from 70.4 years to 74.3 years for men and from
76.4 years to 79.6 years for women. We are getting healthier and we are
better looked after when we are sick.

Growing Resources for a Modern Health Service

This progress has been possible because we have increased spending since
1979 by nearly 75% more than inflation, to almost £43 billion. And we are
not stopping there. The next Conservative Government will honour a firm
guarantee to the NHS.

We will continue, year by year; to increase the real resources committed to
the NHS, so NHS spending will continue to share in a growing economy

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 23 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Under Labour there have been years when resources for the NHS actually
shrank - something that would be inconceivable with the Conservatives.

Money is only really a means to an end: better patient care. Now we are
treating 9.2 million hospital in-patients and day cases as against 6.9 million
in 1992 and 5.1 million in 1979.

Investing in Skilled Staff

We are committed to expanding the medical staff of the NHS. We shall
therefore increase medical school intakes to 5,000 a year by the year 2000
and are ahead of schedule in reaching the target.

Good nursing is the bedrock of the NHS. In particular we will increase the
number of nurses with specialist qualifications in paediatric intensive
care,emergency care, and cancer care. The number of nurses qualifying each
year will increase by 2,500 within the next 5 years as we continue to expand
Project 2000 training.

Higher Standards of Service

We are tackling the problem of long waiting times which can cause so much
worry; distress, and pain. We have set tough targets under the Patient's
Charter and as a result average waiting times for in-patient hospital
treatments have fallen from more than 6 months 5 years ago to 4 months last
year.

Patients no longer put up with being kept in ignorance. They want to know
more.

We will publish more information on how successfully hospitals are
treating patients so that they and their GPs can make more informed
choices between services in different hospitals and help stimulate better
performance

Better Primary Care

Our vision of the NHS is one in which hospitals and family doctors gain
greater power to run their own affairs. That is why we will continue to
encourage the spread of fundholding among GPs. Labour by contrast would
destroy the new freedoms that fundholding doctors enjoy by imposing a new
layer of bureaucracy on top of them.

However, we do not want the benefits of better healthcare to be confined to
patients of GP fundholders. Our proposals to shift more healthcare towards
family doctors are open to all.

We shall implement the new Primary Care Act which will enable all family

doctors to provide a broader range of patient services within their
surgeries. This will include (""super surgeries"" and practice-based cottage

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 24 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

hospitals that can offer faster and more local treatment.

We expect to see the number of nurses working in GP practices continue to
grow, as will the number of GPs.

We will extend nationwide our plans to enable more nurses to prescribe a
wider range of drugs for patients, recognising their contribution to
primary care.

Mental Health

The last decade has also seen major changes in the care of mentally ill
people. We will continue to develop a full range of services - including 24-
hour nursed hostels and secure units - that can care for them in a way which
is most appropriate to them and the interests of the wider community.

We will not dose any long-stay mental hospitals unless it can be shown that
adequate care services exist in the community.

We will strengthen co-operation between health and social services in the
delivery of mental health services. Our recent Green Paper showed how this
can be done. And we will monitor the progress of Health Authorities in
developing proper mental health care plans.

Health of the Nation

A modern health service is not just about treating illness, it is also about
keeping people healthy. This is why we launched the Health of the Nation
strategy in 1992 - the first time England has had a strategy for health. Its aim
is to reduce illness and premature death by identifying common causes of ill
health, like excessive smoking and obesity. Different groups in and outside
the health service then work together to tackle the problems.

We are already seeing progress. Between 1990 and 1994, deaths from
coronary heart disease among the over-65s, the suicide rate, and the number
of teenage pregnancies fell substantially. And last year we announced that
environmental targets would be added to Health of the Nation.

Improved general health means fewer people requiring attention in hospitals
and GP surgeries - and more resources available for patients who need them.
Our Health of the Nation strategy is a vital part of our vision for creating a
health service fit for the 21st Century.

A Modern Health Service
Healthcare is changing fast. Modern technology is constantly increasing the
range of treatments which are available. Conservatives believe that the

benefits of these advances should be made available to patients on the basis
of their clinical need, without regard to their ability to pay.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 25 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Furthermore we also believe that the NHS must have access to sufficient
resources to allow it to invest in the facilities required to deliver up-to-date
healthcare. Since 1979 capital investment in the NHS has proceeded at an
unprecedented rate. In the future we believe these requirements will be best
met in a partnership with the private sector which allows the private sector to
improve the facilities in which NHS healthcare is delivered.

We will promote the Private Finance Initiative which will unleash a new
flow of investment funds into the modernisation of the NHS.

The NHS is a British success story. It commands universal support in
Britain. It is widely admired all over the world. Conservatives are proud of
the part we are playing in improving the NHS still further.

6. Better Public Services

The public sector is being transformed the world over. Britain is in the
vanguard. Everyone else wants to learn from our vision of a smaller state
doing fewer things and doing them better.

Old style public services were centrally planned with little information or
choice for the public who used the service. Our reforms have made these
services more responsive to the public by breaking up cumbersome
bureaucratic structures and shifting power to small responsive local
institutions and the people who work in them. The schools, hospitals and
police have all been transformed in this way. We support the people who do,
not the people who plan.

In order to get better standards we are liberating services from centralised
control over capital. We will push forward our Private Finance Initiative to
break down these old barriers.

We have made public services genuinely accountable, with useful
information and real choices for the people who use them. We set tough
standards and they will get tougher. The Citizen's Charter has raised
standards of customer service. When these high standards are reached we
recognise and reward excellence through our Charter Mark initiative. There
are now 647 Chartermarks and we will aim for more than 2000
Chartermarks by the year 2000.

We will require all government agencies to apply for Chartermarks.

The days of the bureaucratic paperchase are behind us. The future is
""government direct"". We will harness the latest information technology to
place the public sector directly at the service of the citizen. People will be
able to use simple computer terminals to enter information directly. This will
transform time-consuming transactions like completing a tax return or
registering a new business.

Privatisation and Competition

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 26 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

In 20 years, privatisation has gone from the dream of a few Conservative
visionaries to the big idea which is transforming decaying public sector
industries in almost every country in the world. Britain has led the way with
this new industrial revolution: we can be proud of what we have achieved.

In 1979 the Government inherited a range of businesses which had come
into the public sector for different reasons. Many were known for their poor
standards of service, and most were making large losses.

Over the past eighteen years that situation has changed substantially.
Privatisation has enhanced productivity, improved customer services, raised
safety and environmental standards and substantially reduced prices.

Telephone, gas and electricity bills to the customer have fallen as never
before. Telephone waiting lists are unknown, and water, gas and electricity
disconnections have fallen dramatically. Nearly £40 billion in private sector
funding has been committed to a major investment programme to meet
higher quality water standards. We can now look forward to water prices
falling over the years ahead.

Service standards have improved substantially. Before privatisation
published service standards did not exist. Now industry regulators monitor
legal requirements to provide quality services in a competitive environment.
Refunds may be made when performance standards are not met.

Privatisation has benefitted - and will continue to benefit - consumers,
shareholders, employees, and taxpayers. In 1979 the then-nationalised
industries required a £50 million per week subsidy from the taxpayer In
1996 those now privatised companies paid taxes of £60 million per week.

We will ensure private ownership, competition and regulation continue to
deliver lower prices and better services for consumers.

We will extend competition for domestic gas users, and introduce
competition in the water industry, starting with large users.

The Post Office occupies an important part in national life. It comprises
Counter Services, the Royal Mail and Parcelforce. The network of sub-post
offices is vital and most are already run as private businesses. The Royal
Mail provides a universal service at a standard price in every part of the
United Kingdom. No one can imagine a stamp that does not bear the Queen's
head. These characteristics must continue, but reforms are needed to allow
the services to develop. The Royal Mail must face up to the challenges and
opportunities that are arising from increasing competition and the
international liberalisation of services.

We will guarantee to preserve the national identity, universal service and
distinctive characteristics of the Royal Mail, while considering options -
including different forms of privatisation - to introduce private capital and
management skills into its operations.

We will transfer Parcelforce to the private sector whilst ensuring that every

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 12:38

Page 27 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Post Office in the land continues to provide a full parcel service at an
economical price.

Privatisation works. We will therefore continue to pass government activities
into private ownership where this can bring benefits to consumers and
taxpayers.

Local Government

We are developing a new vision for local government.

We believe local government should take a lead in the planning and
development of their communities. To achieve that, we have encouraged
them to work in partnership with central government, with private
enterprise, and other organisations in their community. The impact of local
government is multiplied when they work in this way.

To encourage this partnership, we have developed the new approach of
Challenge Funding. We set up a fund to meet a particular objective and then
invite competing bids for the money. Those who form effective partnerships
are far more likely to win those bids. The Single Regeneration Budget Fund,
for example, has stimulated many working partnerships that are bringing
new life to their communities.

We will push Challenge Funding further to reward effective local
government.

This innovation has the potential to transform the financing of the public
sector.

In addition, we are encouraging higher standards and more cost-effective
provision of local services. Local authorities can enable things to happen
rather than necessarily running them themselves. They must look after the
interests of users of their services - and that is often best done by being a
purchaser, not an employer.

Standards of service are rising in many local authorities. There are, however,
still great disparities between the best and worst performers, as the Audit

Commission shows in their thought-provoking reports.

We will keep up the pressure for higher standards and improved value for
money by insisting on compulsory competitive tendering.

The development of Challenge Funding and the shift in the role of local
authorities from direct employers to purchasers of services will transform

local authorities over the coming years. In the meantime we will, for so long
as is necessary, retain the power to cap local authorities to protect taxpayers.

Strikes in Essential Services

Industrial relations in this country have been transformed. In so far as there

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 28 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

is a still a problem it is concentrated in a few essential services where the
public has no easy alternative and strikers are able to impose massive costs
and inconvenience out of all proportion to the issues at stake. We will protect
ordinary members of the public from this abuse of power.

We will legislate to remove legal immunity from industrial action which
has disproportionate or excessive effect Members of the public and
employers will be able to seek injunctions to prevent industrial action in
these circumstances. Any strike action will also have to be approved by a
majority of all members eligible to vote and ballots will have to be repeated
at regular intervals if negotiations are extended.

Transport

Our railways are already improving now they have been liberated into the
private sector. Passenger numbers are up: more people are using the railways
every day. Investment is up: Railtrack plans to spend £4 million each day on
improving stations and maintaining and renewing the network. The new
train operators are committed to investing £1.5 billion in new and
refurbished rolling stock. And key fares are set to fall in real terms for the
first time in a generation, with guaranteed price controls keeping fare
increases below the level of inflation until at least 2003. We intend to build
on this growing success story to create a thriving railway network for the
new century.

We will complete the successful transfer of British Rail into the
commercial sector.

We now want to draw in private investment to modernise London
Underground and improve services to passengers.

We will bring forward plans to privatise London Underground. Proceeds
from privatisation will be recycled in order to modernise the network
within 5 years - creating an underground system to serve the capital in the
21st Century. We will regulate fares so they rise by no more than inflation
for at least 4 years after privatisation. We will also protect services -
including the Travel Card and concessionary fares.

After completing the modernisation of the network, the majority of the
remaining surplus from privatisation will be channelled into additional
support for transport investment in London and elsewhere in the country.

We will continue to encourage public transport. In particular, we will use the
existing funding for local authorities to promote developments which make
it easier to interchange between bus and rail.

We recognise the needs of road users, and will continue to work with the
private sector to sustain our road building and maintenance programme.
Already under the Private Finance Initiative the private sector is contributing
some £1 billion to investment in roads and achieving significant savings in
construction costs. We will also tackle road congestion by introducing new

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 29 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

regional traffic control centres, by extending the use of variable speed limits,
and by ensuring that local authorities have the necessary powers to act. We
will promote a cleaner environment by supporting a Europe-wide reduction
in vehicle emissions, and encouraging the manufacture of more fuel-efficient
vehicles.

We will continue to build on our record of improving safety on roll-on roll-
off ferries and cargo ships through higher standards of survivability and the
measures in the Merchant Shipping Act.

We will continue to make it easier for people to travel by air. Already over
the last 5 years opening up the market in Europe has led to more services
and lower fares. We will build on that success in negotiations with the
United States and other countries. We will also continue to encourage the
development of regional airports offering new direct services to the rest of
the world in the same way that we have already opened up new regional
links with Europe and the United States. We will privatise the National Air
Traffic Service because it will be run better in the private sector.

Competition and enterprise are the best way to improve our transport
system.

A Safe and Civil Society

Our Record - A Safe and Civil Society

e Spending on the police has doubled since 1979 after allowing for
inflation. There are now about 16,000 more police officers than when
we took office. 2,360 more constables have been recruited since the
last election and the Government is giving Chief Officers the
resources to recruit 5,000 police constables over the 3 years to 1999.

¢ Recorded crime has dropped in each of the last 4 years. It is now over
10% down on 1992 levels - more than half a million fewer offences -
the biggest drop since records were first kept.

¢ There are now 153,000 Neighbourhood Watch schemes in England
and Wales - 38,000 more than in 1992 - covering 5.5 million homes.
We have helped fund over 4,000 closed circuit TV schemes over the
last 2 years for additional security.

¢ Our national DNA database - the first in the world - now has over
112,000 samples on it. 3,300 matches have so far been made between
suspects and crime stains.

e The Government has increased the maximum penalty for taking a gun
to a crime and for attempted rape to life imprisonment. Since 1985 the
average sentence for violence against the person has risen by a third
and for sexual offences by nearly 40%.

¢ The number of cars stolen has fallen by nearly 20% in the last four
years - that is about 100,000 fewer cars stolen.

e We have built 22 new prisons since 1980. Slopping out has ended. No
prisoners now sleep three to a cell designed for one. Prison escapes
have fallen by 80% since the last election.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 30 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

e Mandatory drug testing has been introduced throughout the Prison
Service. Home leave has been cut back - down by half in two years.

e We have made witness intimidation a crime. 500 people were charged
with that offence in 1995 alone.

e We have stepped up the fight against drugs and organised crime,
giving the Security Service powers to support the police and Customs
and Excise in tracking down the serious criminals.

7. Law, Order and Security

People have a right to sleep safely in their homes and walk safely on the
streets. Governments have a duty to maintain that security.

Our reforms are aimed at ensuring that crime does not pay. And they are
working - the pessimists and the scoffers are wrong. Recorded crime has
fallen every year for the last 4 years. It is now 10% lower than it was in
1992. That is over half a million fewer crimes - the biggest drop since
records were first kept in the middle of the 19th century.

But crime is still too high. We must do more. Our aim is to keep crime
falling over the lifetime of the next parliament. This is what we will do.

Safer Communities

Anti-social behaviour and petty crime disrupt communities and spread
human misery. The police are rightly now vigorously tackling problems such
as graffiti vandalism and drunkenness. Where such behaviour goes
unchecked more serious crimes will follow.

We will support chief constables who develop local schemes to crack down
on petty crime and improve public order.

Closed circuit television has proved enormously successful in increasing
public safety.

We will fulfil the Prime Minister's pledge to support the installation of
10,000 CCTV cameras in town centres and public places in the 3 years to
1999. We will provide £75 million over the lifetime of the next parliament
to continue extending CCTV to town centres, villages and housing estates
up and down the country that want to bid for support.

We will also continue to take other steps to improve the safety of our streets
and communities. In this parliament we have given the police power to seize
alcohol from under-18s caught drinking in public. The police have been
given the power to stop and search in a specified area for up to 48 hours if
they reasonably believe people to be carrying knives.

Identity Cards can also make a contribution to safer communities.

We will introduce a voluntary identity card scheme based on the new
photographic driving licence it will, for example, enable retailers to

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

identify youngsters trying to buy alcohol and cigarettes or rent classified
videos when they are under age.

Tackling Juvenile Crime

A fifth of all crime is committed by under-18s. We are encouraging schools
to reduce truancy through the publication of league tables and by supporting
local projects to tackle the problem. We are developing a network of local
teams to identify children who are at risk of turning to crime and to take
early steps to address the factors which put them at risk.

We will encourage these local child crime teams to refer children from
primary school age upwards who are at risk of, or who are actually,
offending to programmes to tackle their behaviour and fully involve their
parents.

The courts would be able to impose an order - a Parental Control Order -
on the parents of children whom they believed could keep control of their
children but were refusing to do so.

Courts will be given the power to attach conditions to Parental Control
Orders. Conditions might include a requirement to keep their children in at
night, taking their children to and from school, attending a drug
rehabilitation clinic or going to sessions to improve their skills as parents.
Parents who breached these conditions - in defiance of the court - would face
a range of possible sanctions.

Appearing before a youth court should be a daunting experience for the
juvenile concerned. All too often it is not. At the moment about a third of all
juveniles appearing before the youth courts are discharged without any
punishment at all This sends all the wrong signals to youngsters -
particularly first time offenders - who then feel they can get away with
crime.

We will give the courts the power to impose speedy sanctions on
youngsters, involving wherever possible an element of reparation to the
victim. The probation service - rather than social services - will be
responsible for enforcing community punishments for under-16s.

Persistent juvenile offenders need to be properly punished. We are piloting a
tough new regime, with a heavy emphasis on discipline, at a young offenders
institution and at the military prison in Colchester In 1994 we doubled the
maximum sentence for 15-17 year olds to 2 years detention in a young
offenders institution. We have given the courts the freedom to allow the
publication of the names of convicted juveniles. We will give the courts the
power to detain persistent 12-14 year old offenders in secure training centres
once the places become available.

We have given the courts the power to impose electronically monitored
curfews on 10 to 15 year old offenders. We will introduce pilots to test their
effectiveness. If successful we will consider extending them nationwide.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 32 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM
Catching, Convicting and Punishing

We back the police every inch of the way. There are now about 16,000 more
police officers - and over 18,000 more civilians helping them - than when we
took office. We are providing chief constables with the resources to recruit
5,000 extra police constables in the three years to 1999.

We support police initiatives to target the hard core of persistent criminals.
Intelligence is crucial for this.

We will establish a national crime squad to provide on improved nationally
coordinated approach to organised crime.

Once caught, criminals must be convicted and then properly punished. The
public needs to be protected. We have reformed the right to silence, despite
opposition from Labour. The number of suspects refusing to answer police
questions has nearly halved as a result.

We have piloted curfew orders for adult offenders. They have been shown to
keep criminals indoors - curbing their freedom as a punishment - and
keeping them out of trouble in the meantime.

We will extend electronically monitored curfew orders nationwide for
those aged 16 and over.

Persistent offenders account for a high proportion of all crime. Prison works
- not only as a deterrent, but in keeping these criminals off the street. Those
sent to prison are less likely to re-offend on release than those given a
community punishment. We will provide another 8,500 prison places by the
year 2000.

We will introduce minimum sentences for violent and persistent criminals to
help protect the public more effectively, reversing Labour's wrecking

amendments to our tough Crime Bill.

Anyone convicted of a second serious sexual or violent crime, like rape or
armed robbery, will get an automatic life sentence.

Persistent house burglars and dealers in hard drugs will receive
mandatory minimum prison sentences of 3 and 7 years respectively.

We will restore honesty in sentencing by abolishing automatic early
release.

Support for Victims
Concern for the victim must be at the heart of our entire approach to the

criminal justice system. We will continue to give strong backing to Victim
Support.

We will give courts in all cases the discretion to allow witnesses to give

13/06/2024, 12:38

evidence anonymously if they believe them to be at risk from reprisal.

We will also take action to allow a judge to stop a defendant from
personally questioning the victim in rape cases and other cases where the
victim is particularly vulnerable.

Conservatives are on the side of the victims not the criminal.
Strengthening the Fight Against City Crime

Crime that takes place through manipulation of financial accounts and
markets is as serious as crime on the street.

The City's unchallenged position as Europe's most dynamic and successful
financial centre owes a great deal to its reputation for honesty and fair
dealing. We will help ensure that this reputation is maintained.

We will bring forward in the next parliament a package of measures
designed to modernise the current systems for dealing with City fraud.

This will include legislation to allow the Inland Revenue to pass confidential
information to the police, the Serious Fraud Office and the financial
regulators to assist in the investigation of cases involving serious financial
fraud. We will also remove the remaining legal obstacles to the controlled
exchange of confidential information between the police and the regulators
in this kind of case.

Faster Justice

Justice delayed is justice denied. It is wrong that people who are innocent
should face an excessive wait before the start of their trial. The guilty must
be held to account for their actions promptly. And victims should be given
the chance to draw a line under their experience as quickly as possible. We
are determined to speed up justice without diminishing the genuine rights of
every citizen to a fair trial.

Last October the government set up a review of delays in the criminal justice
system. It made a series of detailed recommendations. We see merit in those
recommendations and will seek the views of interested parties. We believe
that taken together they could dramatically speed up the prosecution process,
bringing the guilty to justice and acquitting the innocent more quickly.

All defendants would appear in court the next working day after they were
charged. At least half of them would be convicted the next day compared

with just 3 per cent at the moment. And the time taken to bring juveniles to
court would be cut from 10 weeks to a matter of days.

Civil Justice
The civil justice system of this country is a vital part of its competitive

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 34 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

economy and has a high international reputation. The commercial courts
attract substantial litigation from all over the world, generating significant
foreign earnings. We will work to maintain the high standing of these courts.

We have greatly improved the service the civil courts provide for the
aggrieved citizen. The simple procedure for small claims has been extended
to claims up to £3,000. For large claims the county court now provides an
efficient local service with specialised courts in many locations around the
country leaving the High Court to deal with the more complex and difficult
issues.

We will push ahead with the major reforms now under way which will
greatly speed up the process and improve the delivery of justice without
imposing additional burdens on the taxpayer.

The Legal Profession

We will ensure that the framework in which the legal profession operates is
responsive to the changing needs of our people and is one in which
unjustified restrictions have no place. We have, for example, given most
solicitors rights of audience in the higher courts under appropriate
conditions.

Legal Aid

People are rightly concerned about the rising costs of legal aid. We have
taken many steps to control the burden and to deny access to legal aid to the
""apparently wealthy"" - those who qualified technically, but whose lifestyles
suggested they should not.

But more is required:

We will change the structure of legal aid to ensure that it, like other vital
public services, functions within defined cash limits.

This will enable us to identify priorities and serve them much more
efficiently than the present system.

Drugs

Drugs are a menace to the very fabric of our society They ruin the lives of
addicts and their families. They can destroy whole neighbourhoods. The
promising youth of today can too easily become the sad dropouts of
tomorrow turning to crime and violence.

The Conservative Government has a comprehensive strategy, launched in
1995, committed to fighting drugs in communities and in schools. It is tough
on criminals and vigilant at our ports. It is respected throughout the world.
We spend over £500m every year in tackling all aspects of drug problems.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 35 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We will continue the fight against drugs through a coordinated approach:
being tough on pushers; reducing demand by educating young people;
tackling drug abuse at local level through Drug Action Teams; saying
""No"" to legalising drugs; and working with international agencies and
foreign governments to resist the menace spreading.

This pernicious evil has to be fought by all of us.
A Confident, United and Sovereign Nation

Our Record - The Nation

¢ Many of our old cities have been rejuvenated through a partnership of
public and private investment.

e The area of green belt has doubled since 1979.

e Water and air quality in the UK have improved significantly.

e We are one of only a few nations on course to meet our commitment
to return emissions of all greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2000.

¢ The Lottery has been established as the most successful in the world -
raising £3 billion for good causes in a little over 2 years.

¢ More support is now given to arts and heritage than at any time in our
nation's history. We now provide nearly 20% more for the arts than the
last Labour Government, over and above inflation.

¢ British talent was this year nominated for 30 Oscars. British music is
again receiving international acclaim. The industry is worth £2.5
billion, more than shipbuilding or electric components: one in 5 CDs
and records sold anywhere has a British connection.

e There is record investment in our sports facilities. Already the Lottery
has provided £480 million for sport, including the planned British
Academy of Sport, English National Stadium and, for the first time,
direct funding for British athletes.

« We have continued to stand up for British interests in Europe,
protecting our opt-out from the Social Chapter, maintaining our border
controls, and preserving our budget rebate - worth £18 billion since it
was introduced.

e We have the most professional armed forces in the world. We have
modernised our nuclear deterrent by replacing Polaris with Trident.

8. The Best Place in the World to Live

Britain is admired the world oven Every year, millions of tourists travel here
to enjoy our heritage and culture, our cities and countryside, our way of life.
Our nation's history is an anchor in a sea of change. We need to protect,
cherish and build upon what is great about our country so our children grow
up in a better Britain. We also must make sure that everyone, wherever they
live, has the support of a strong, tolerant and civilised community.

Our aim is for this generation and future generations to take pride in Britain
as the best place in the world to live.

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38
Britain's Cities

London is one of the world's greatest cities. It is livelier than even Our vision
of its future is set out in a separate manifesto.

Many of our cities have undergone a complete transformation over the last
decade. We have promoted partnerships - through schemes such as Urban
Development Corporations, the Single Regeneration Budget and City Pride -
to attract private enterprise and investment back to inner-cities. These
initiatives are bringing hope, opportunity and prosperity to what were once
wastelands of urban decline.

As the country thrives and becomes more prosperous, one of our central
tasks is to apply the same approach in transforming the legacy of soulless,
decaying public housing estates. They are places that suffer from the very
worst kind of poverty - poverty of aspiration.

We have already made a start - spending more than £2bn over the last 10
years on improving 500 of the worst estates. And we have shown how it is
possible to tackle the economic and social problems alongside new
investment in buildings - where possible, bringing in a greater mix of public
tenants and private housing to recreate a more balanced community. Now we
will extend this approach, focusing the Single Regeneration Budget to
launch a combined attack on crime, unemployment and under-achievement,
and developing the government's partnership with the private sector to help
fund the massive investment that will be required.

Over the next decade, we aim to raise some £25bn of new private
investment in housing estates by encouraging tenants in more than half of
the remaining public sector housing stock to opt for transferring their
homes to new landlords. These transfers will only occur where tenants
choose this mute to improve theft estates.

We will use this approach to regenerate the worst housing estates and
transform the lives of those who live in them - targeting support for
programmes to improve education standards, employment and crime
prevention alongside new private sector investment.

As well as this attack on poor housing, we will continue to help the
homeless. We will carry through our planned extension of the Rough Sleeper
Initiative from London to other big cities.

We will provide sufficient hostel places to ensure that no-one need sleep
out on the streets.

Rural Communities

Britain is blessed with some of the most beautiful countryside in Europe.

We need to protect the best of the countryside whilst ensuring good jobs
and living conditions for people who live there.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 37 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We have to strike a balance: our rural communities must not become rural
museums, but remain vibrant places to live and work. We will make sure
government departments work together to ensure that balance is kept.

We will continue to protect the green belt from development, making sure
that derelict and under-used urban land is developed in preference to
greenfield sites.

We will use the planning system to ensure that more new homes are built
on reclaimed sites in our towns and cities. We will aim for more than 60
per cent of all new homes to be built on derelict sites.

This will reduce the pressure to build in our countryside and expand choice
where it is needed most.

We will support our rural communities, by giving special rate support to
small village shops and post offices. The planning system can do more to
help too.

We will introduce a new Rural Business Use Class to encourage job
creation in the countryside.

We will increase support for schemes which promote care for the
countryside - like Countryside Stewardship.

We believe participation in traditional country pursuits, including fishing, is
a matter for individuals. A Conservative Government will not introduce
legislation that interferes with the rights of people to take part in these
activities.

We will also encourage managed public access to private land - in agreement
with farmers and landowners - but strongly resist a general right to roam,
which would damage the countryside and violate the right to private

property.

We aim to double Britain's forest cover over the next fifty years. We will
continue to encourage tree planting by targeting grants, encouraging
investment in wood processing, and using new freedoms with the reform of
the Common Agricultural Policy.

Agriculture and Fisheries

We will continue to provide robust support to the British beef industry
through the BSE crisis until its long term strength is restored. We will
vigorously pursue the eradication of BSE in the United Kingdom, as we
have been doing successfully for the last eight years. We will spare no
efforts in our fight against the unwarranted ban on British beef exports.

Public health and food safety have been the government's top priorities
throughout the BSE crisis.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 38 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We will tighten up control over food safety by appointing a powerful and
independent Chief Food Safety Adviser and Food Safety Council to advise
government

We will continue to push for fundamental reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy, moving away from production support to measures that
will give our farmers the opportunity to compete while safeguarding the
rural environment. We will ensure that no change to the Common
Agricultural Policy unfairly disadvantages British farmers.

Fishing is a vital industry in many parts of coastal Britain. We will continue
our fight to secure a prosperous long term future for the industry and
sustainable management of our fish stocks.

We will insist at the IGC and elsewhere on measures to stop quota hopping
and prevent the vessels of other countries from using UK fishing quotas.

The integrity of our 6 and 12 mile fishing limits is not negotiable. We reject
any idea of a single European fishing fleet.

We believe that fishermen should have more say in decisions affecting their
industry We will press the European Commission to establish regional
committees to give fishermen a direct influence in fishing policy. We will use
these committees to develop new ways of managing quotas and regulating
fisheries which are more sensitive to the industry's needs.

Animal Welfare

A civilised society respects animals. Britain will continue to take the lead in
improving standards of animal welfare in Europe. In 1995 we secured a
major breakthrough in the treatment of animals in transport; in 1996 we won
victory in our campaign to ban veal crates throughout the EU. We are
determined that standards should continue to rise and that all EU countries
should have to meet them.

We will seek to ensure that all European countries have to raise animal
welfare standards.

We are not going to take any risks with rabies. There may however be ways
other than quarantine which maintain or increase protection for public
health, while improving the welfare of pets and reducing the costs to
travellers.

We will publish a Green Paper on rabies protection, setting out all the
options including the existing controls, early in the new parliament.

Britain's Environment
Britain has an enviable track record in protecting our environment. Our

rivers, beaches and water are cleaner and we are using our energy more
efficiently. We are leading the world in reducing the level of the ""greenhouse

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 39 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

gases"" that cause global warming and pressing for policies that will enable
the world to sustain development without long-term damage to the
environment. Our Green Manifesto is published separately.

We have clear objectives to build on this record. We will set tough, but
affordable targets, with published environmental strategies to improve air
quality and banish city smog - with tighter standards on vehicle emissions
and pollution crackdowns around the country We aim for sustained
improvements in water quality, at a pace which industry and consumers can
afford. We will develop labelling of products that gives consumers
information to show the environmental impact of how they were made.

In addition, we will continue to use the tax system and other incentives to
encourage the use of vehicles and fuel which do not pollute the environment.
And we will continue to explore policies based on the principle of polluter
pays:

those who contaminate land, pollute the environment or produce harmful
waste should be made responsible for their actions and pay for the
consequences.

Britain - A Tolerant Country

Tolerance, civility and respect have always been hallmarks of our nation. It
is thanks to them that we have an excellent record in race relations.

Everybody, regardless of colour or creed, has the right to go about his or her
life free from the threat of intimidation. We are taking tough action to tackle
harassment. Under proposals in the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, it
will be a crime to behave in a way which causes someone else to be
harassed. The maximum penalty will be 6 months in prison.

Firm, but fair, immigration controls underpin good race relations. We will
ensure that, while genuine asylum seekers are treated sympathetically,
people do not abuse these provisions to avoid normal immigration controls.

A World Leader In Sports, Arts and Culture

Britain is enjoying a cultural renaissance. British music, films, television,
fashion, art and food are winning plaudits the world oven They add
excitement, fun and enjoyment to our lives. Our success brings pride to
everyone.

The National Lottery, which John Major set up, will pump billions of pounds
into Britain's good causes. Its proceeds will weave a new, rich thread of
opportunity and charity into the tapestry of British life. In addition to
benefitting major national institutions, about half of the awards are for
amounts under £25 000 - benefitting local communities up and down the
country. We will encourage new ways of distributing awards to support the
performing arts - through support for amateur productions and community

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 40 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

events, providing more musical instruments, and helping productions tour
round the country.

The National Lottery will also help us train and promote British sporting
talent. The English National Stadium and British Academy of Sport, funded
by the Lottery, will be new focal points for sporting events and excellence.
We will encourage more young people to play sport by ensuring every
school plays a minimum level of sport, including competitive sports, and
developing a network of Sporting Ambassadors - sporting celebrities who
will visit schools to inspire young people. We will also encourage the Sports
Council to use Lottery money to employ over 1000 additional community
sports coaches to assist in schools.

We will encourage the use of Lottery money to train young athletes and
artists, with revenue funding for bursaries, concessionary tickets to
professional performances and support for young people's organisations
and productions.

The development of young talent is important in all fields.

The Lottery will also fund our Millennium celebrations. They will be
inspirational as well as enjoyable. We want these be a showcase of British
excellence. Britain will be able to look back on past achievements with
pride, and look forward with confidence.

9. Europe and the World

Britain is a world leader as well as a European nation. Our economic
strength, our history and our language make us a global trading nation with
links right around the world. Only the United Kingdom is a member of the
European Union, the United Nations Security Council, the Commonwealth,
NATO and the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. In the Gulf,
Bosnia, Cyprus and Northern Iraq, John Major has shown how our nation
can contribute to world peace.

We will continue to work with international partners to secure peace and
stability in areas of tension such as former Yugoslavia; in Kashmir; in
Cyprus; and in the Middle East. We will promote reform of the United
Nations to make it a more effective organisation for securing international
stability. Britain will continue to deploy our outstanding Armed Forces as
peacekeepers under the United Nations. And we will support the aspirations
of the Poles, Czechs, Hungarians and others to join the European Union and
NATO.

After the transfer of Hong Kong, we will work under the terms of the Joint
Declaration to help sustain the prosperity and way of life of the people of
Hong Kong and build on the substantial British interests that will remain.

We will continue to support the Commonwealth, our unique global network,

to encourage the spread of democracy; as set out in the Harare Declaration.
We will focus our aid programme to encourage sustainable development in

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 41 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

countries that are growing towards self sufficiency under democratic
government. We have taken the lead in alleviating the burden of debt for the
world's poorest countries. We also have significant flows of private
investment to developing economies. We are more than achieving the long
term UN target of 1% of GDP for the transfer of wealth to less developed
countries. We will continue to maintain a significant bilateral and
multilateral aid programme reflecting the aspiration of meeting the UN's
target of 0.7% of GDP for aid as a long-term objective.

We will also continue to provide leadership in Europe and internationally on
environmental issues, building on the Rio Conference to encourage
sustainable development - meeting our commitment to reduce Carbon
Dioxide (CO) emissions by 10% on 1990 levels by 2010 to prevent climate
change. The Prime Minister has committed himself to attending the next UN
Environmental Conference in June.

Britain and the European Union

We believe that in an uncertain, competitive world, the nation state is a rock
of security. A nation's common heritage, culture, values and outlook are a
precious source of stability. Nationhood gives people a sense of belonging.

The government has a positive vision for the European Union as a
partnership of nations. We want to be in Europe but not run by Europe. We
have much to gain from our membership of the European Union - in trade, in
co-operation between governments, and in preserving European peace. We
benefit from the huge trade opportunities that have opened up since Britain
led the way in developing Europe's single market. We want to see the rest of
Europe follow the same deregulated, enterprise policies that have
transformed our economic prospects in Britain.

However, in June, the nations of the European Union will gather in
Amsterdam to negotiate possible amendments to the Treaty of Rome. It is a
moment of truth, setting the direction in which the European Union will go.
It will also be crucial in ensuring that we have a relationship with the rest of
Europe with which we can be comfortable.

A Conservative Government will seek a partnership of nation states. Some
others would like to build a federal Europe. A British Conservative
Government will not allow Britain to be part of a federal European state.

The diversity of Europe's nations is its strength. As more nations join the
European Union, it needs to become flexible not more rigid We must also
ensure that any developments which only include some members do not
work to the disadvantage of others.

Our priorities for Europe's development will be enlargement of the
Community, completion of the single market, reform of the European Court
of Justice, and further strengthening of the role of national parliaments. We
will seek more co-operation between national governments on areas of
common interest - defence, foreign policy and the fight against international

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 42 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

crime and drugs. We also believe the European Union itself should do less,
but do it better. So we have proposed incorporating the principle of
subsidiarity - that the European Union should only do that which cannot be
done by member states acting alone - into the Treaty. This is how we are
approaching the Inter-Governmental Conference.

We will argue for a flexible Europe which fully accommodates the interests
and aspirations of all its member states and where any new proposals have
to be open to all and agreed by all. We will not accept other changes to the
Treaty that would further centralise decision-making, reduce national
sovereignty, or remove our right to permanent opt-outs.

We will retain Britain's veto and oppose further extension of qualified
majority voting in order to ensure we can prevent policies that would be
harmful to the national interest. We will defend the rights of national
parliaments and oppose more powers being given to the European
Parliament at the expense of national parliaments.

We will take whatever steps are necessary to keep our frontier controls. We
will resist attempts to change the inter-governmental nature of co-
operation in justice and home affairs. We will not accept the development
of new legal rights that extend the concept of European citizenship.

Britain's rebate has so far saved British taxpayers £18bn and we will protect
it.

One of the greatest challenges Europe faces is to cut unemployment and
make its businesses competitive. Here Britain is leading the way. We will
continue to argue for deregulation and lower costs on Europe's businesses,
the policies that have helped give Britain one of the strongest economies in
Europe. We will not put that achievement at risk by signing up to the Social
Chapter, which would open the door to imposing the high costs of the
European social model on British business. Once Britain accepted the Social
Chapter we could not stop many of these damaging policies being imposed
on us by qualified majority voting.

We will insist that any new Treaty recognises that our opt-out from the
Social Chapter enables Britain to be exempt from the Working Time
Directive, and prevents any abuse of our opt-out. And we will not accept a
new employment chapter in any revised Treaty, which would expose British
businesses to new costs.

We made it clear in the previous chapter that we will continue to work for
further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the lifting of the
worldwide ban on British beet and will insist on measures to stop quota
hopping by foreign fishing vessels.

Protecting Britain's interests demands tough, experienced negotiation. John
Major has proved he has these qualities - including the resolve to say no
when necessary even if that means being isolated. Labour have said they
would never let Britain be isolated in Europe: they would damage Britain's

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 43 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

success by undermining our veto, signing up to the Social Chapter and
following in others' footsteps - even where they lead in the wrong direction.
They support policies that would fragment the United Kingdom's influence
within a Europe of Regions. The Liberal Democrats welcome the end of the
nation state. Only the Conservatives can be trusted to stand up for Britain in
Europe: our national interest must be protected.

A Single Currency: Our Referendum Guarantee

The creation of a European single currency would be of enormous
significance for all European states whether they are members or not. We
must take account of all the consequences for Britain of such a major
development of policy.

John Major secured for us at Maastricht an opt-out from the commitment to
enter a single currency. It is only because of this opt-out that we have the
right to negotiate and then decide whether it is in Britain's interest to join.

It is in our national interest to take part in the negotiations. Not to do so
would be an abdication of responsibility. A single currency would affect us
whether we were in or out. We need to participate in discussions in order to
ensure the rules are not fixed against our interests. The national interest is
not served by exercising our option - one way or the other - before we have
to.

For a single currency to come into effect, European economies will have to
meet crucial criteria. On the information currently available, we believe that
it is very unlikely that there will be sufficient convergence of economic
conditions across Europe for a single currency to proceed safely on the target
date of January Ist 1999. We will not include legislation on the single
currency in the first Queen's Speech. If it cannot proceed safely, we believe it
would be better for Europe to delay any introduction of a single currency
rather than rush ahead to meet an artificial timetable. We will argue this case
in the negotiations that lie ahead.

We believe it is in our national interest to keep our options open to take a
decision on a single currency when all the facts are before us. If a single
currency is created, without sustainable convergence, a British
Conservative government will not be part of it.

If, during the course of the next parliament, a Conservative government
were to conclude that it was in our national interest to join a single
currency, we have given a guarantee that no such decision would be
implemented unless the British people gave their express approval in a
referendum.

Defence in an Unstable World

The old rivalries of the Cold War have been replaced by new tensions.
Britain must be able to react rapidly to protect our security and interests

around the globe.

Our armed forces are the most professional in the world. We have cut
unnecessary bureaucracy and increased efficiency, and directed money to
support our Services in the frontline. We have made the changes necessary
to adapt our Services to the threats which we might now face. We have set
out defence plans based on stable levels of funding. There is no need for a
defence review, which would raise fear and uncertainty about the future.

We will continue to ensure the Services have the modern weapons they need
to guarantee their superiority against potential aggressors. We will make sure
we can conduct military operations throughout the world, and develop our
capability to deploy the three services together and rapidly, including the
ability to transport heavy equipment into an operational zone. We will take
part in ballistic missile defence research so we can decide whether we
should procure any such system for the United Kingdom.

We will continue to target our efforts on recruiting for the armed forces. We
will set up an Army Foundation College, which will provide 1,300 places for
16 and 17 year olds who want to join the Army. We will also enable the
reserve forces to play a more active role in operations. We appreciate the
enormous value of cadet forces, and our current plans include resources to
encourage their further development.

We will continue to support Britain's defence industry, and we will work
with companies to identify the technologies of the future.

NATO will remain the cornerstone of our security. We will resist attempts to
bring the Western European Union under the control of the European Union,
and ensure that defence policy remains a matter for sovereign nations.

10. The Constitution

Alone in Europe, the history of the United Kingdom has been one of
stability and security; We owe much of that to the strength and stability of
our constitution - the institutions, laws and traditions that bind us together as
a nation.

Our constitution has been stable, but not static. It has been woven over the
centuries - the product of hundreds of years of knowledge, experience and
history.

Radical changes that alter the whole character of our constitutional balance
could unravel what generations of our predecessors have created. To
preserve that stability in future - and the freedoms and rights of our citizens -
we need to continue a process of evolution, not revolution.

Conservatives embrace evolutionary change that solves real problems and
improves the way our constitution works. In recent years we have opened up
government, devolved power and accountability, and introduced reforms to
make parliament work more effectively. It is that evolutionary process that

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 45 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38
we are committed to continue.
Open, Accountable Government

In recent years we have taken significant steps to open up government to
public scrutiny, and give individuals more information to hold government
and public services to account.

We have introduced a code on access to government information, policed by
the Ombudsman. We have published information on the workings of
government previously held secret -including the composition of cabinet
committees, and the structure of the security and intelligence services. We
have introduced a new civil service code, and reformed the process for
public appointments. We are pledged to legislate on the commitments in our
1993 White Paper on Open Government, including a statutory right of
access by citizens to personal records held about them by the government
and other public authorities. And we have set up the Nolan Committee and
have implemented its proposals to ensure that the highest standards are
maintained in public life.

But our reforms go even wider than that. We have transferred power from
central bureaucracies to local organisations such as school governors and
hospital trusts. We have introduced the Citizen's Charter We have also
required them to publish information on their performance - information
which enables the local community to keep a check on standards and apply
pressure where needed. Wherever possible, we are widening competition
and choice in public services. We showed in Chapter 6 how we wished to
push this agenda forward.

Regional government would be a dangerously centralising measure - taking
power away from elected local authorities. We wish to go in the opposite
direction, shifting power to the local neighbourhood - for example, by giving
more power to parish councils.

Parliament

Parliament - alongside the Crown and our legal system - is one of the three
key institutions that uphold our constitution. The supremacy of parliament is
fundamental to our democracy, and the guarantee of our freedoms. The last
17 years have seen many changes to strengthen parliament and make it more
effective - the flourishing of select committees, new procedures to scrutinise
European legislation, reform of parliament's working day, and a budget that
brings together tax and spending.

We have therefore already done much to improve the way parliament works
and will do more. We have accepted the proposal from the Public Service
Select Committee and put before the House of Commons a clear new
statement of the principles underlying ministerial accountability to
parliament.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 46 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

All these developments have made parliament open to the citizen, and the
government more accountable. In the next session of parliament we will
continue this careful reform.

To give parliament more time to consider legislation thoroughly we will
extend the Queen's Speech to cover not only legislation for the immediate
year but also provisional plans for legislation in the year after that

This will mean that more draft bills will be subject to public scrutiny before
they reach the floor of the House of Commons. It will give select committees
more time to take evidence and report. And this should also mean better
legislation.

We do not believe there is a case for more radical reform that would
undermine the House of Commons. A new Bill of Rights, for example,
would risk transferring power away from parliament to legal courts -
undermining the democratic supremacy of parliament as representatives of
the people. Whilst this may be a necessary check in other countries which
depend upon more formalised written constitutions, we do not believe it is
appropriate to the UK.

Nor do we favour changes in the system of voting in parliamentary elections
that would break the link between an individual member of parliament and
his constituents. A system of proportional representation would be more
likely to produce unstable, coalition governments that are unable to provide
effective leadership - with crucial decisions being dependent on compromise
deals hammered out behind closed doors. This is not the British way.

We have demonstrated we are not against change where it is practical and
beneficial. But fundamental changes which have not been fully thought
through - such as opposition proposals on the House of Lords - would be
extremely damaging. We will oppose change for change's sake.

The Union

The Union between Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England
underpins our nation's stability. The Conservative commitment to the United
Kingdom does not mean ignoring the distinctive individuality of the
different nations. On the contrary, we have gone further in recognising that
diversity than any previous government. We are publishing separate
manifestos for Wales and Scotland.

While preserving the role of parliament at the centre of the Union, we have
given new powers to the Scottish Grand Committee and Welsh Grand
Committee - enabling Scottish and Welsh MPs to call Ministers to account
and debate legislation which affects those countries - something that would
be impossible with separate Assemblies. For the first time, Welsh members
of parliament can ask their questions to Ministers in Welsh in Wales. Most
recently we have similarly extended the basic powers of the Northern Ireland
Grand Committee.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 47 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We believe this is the right way to go. By contrast, the development of new
assemblies in Scotland and Wales would create strains which could well pull
apart the Union. That would create a new layer of government which would
be hungry for power. It would risk rivalry and conflict between these
parliaments or assemblies and the parliament at Westminster. And it would
raise serious questions about whether the representation of Scottish and
Welsh MPs at Westminster - and their role in matters affecting English
affairs - could remain unchanged.

Nor do we believe it would be in the interests of the Scottish or Welsh
people. A Scottish tax-raising parliament, for example, could well affect the
choice of where new investment locates in the United Kingdom.

In a world where people want security, nothing would be more dangerous
than to unravel a constitution that binds our nation together and the
institutions that bring us stability. We will continue to fight for the strength
and diversity that benefits all of us as a proud union of nations.

Northern Ireland

While we cherish the Union and Northern Ireland's place within it, we
recognise that there exist within the Province special circumstances which
require further action to be taken.

After a quarter of a century we wish to see the unique and originally
temporary system of direct rule ended and a successful restoration of local
accountable democracy achieved. We want to see this brought about in a
form which carries the broadest agreement possible. And we want to see the
rights, traditions and interests of all parts of the community recognised
within any such agreement.

We will accordingly continue to pursue a policy of dialogue and negotiation
with and between the democratic Northern Ireland parties. We will continue
to underpin such negotiations with the guarantee that the constitutional
position of Northern Ireland cannot and will not be changed without the
broad consent of the people of Northern Ireland. At the same time we will
continue to take whatever security measures are required to protect the
people of Northern Ireland from those who seek to achieve their political
goals by violent means.

We seek peace. But we will never be swayed by terrorist violence nor will

we ever compromise our principles with those who seek to overthrow the
tule of law by force.

A Choice of Two Futures

At this election the British people face a stark choice. A choice of two
futures.

They can elect to continue down the road of success and achievement. An

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1997/1997-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 48 of 51

1997 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

opportunity that has been hard won by the efforts and sacrifices of the
British people. An opportunity that has only come about because successive
Conservative governments have been determined to face up to the long term
problems facing Britain, and take the tough steps needed to arrest our slow
decline.

Or they can elect to take a huge risk with that future - the future of
themselves, their children, their nation - by handing over the government of
the country to politicians who have fought, opposed and denigrated every
step that has been taken to restore Britain's economic health and standing in
the world. Politicians whose own declared policies would burden the United
Kingdom with new spending and taxation, new regulations, and new threats
to the stability and sovereignty of the nation itself.

You can only be sure with the Conservatives.

1992 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

The Best Future for Britain

Foreword

At the end of this Parliament a new Millennium will be in view We must
raise our sights high. This Manifesto is about making our country respected
and secure, and helping you achieve a better; safer and more prosperous
future. For I believe - strongly - that you, and not the Government, should be
in charge of your life. That's what Conservatism stands for. That principle
underlies all the policies in this Manifesto.

I believe in a responsible society Government's duties are clear: to protect
Britain in a dangerous world; to look after those who cannot look after
themselves; to protect law-abiding people from crime and disorder; and to
protect the value of our currency - without which all spending pledges are
worthless and all savings at risk.

But I believe also in a society in which government doesn't try to take
responsibility away from people. Politicians must never make the mistake of
thinking the state always knows best, or that it is entitled to the lion's share
of people's money I believe in low taxes not just because they ignite
enterprise - the spark of economic growth - but because they put power and
choice where it belongs: in your hands.

So when you compare what the politicians are saying in this election, ask
yourself these questions. Whom do you trust to take responsibility for
Britain's defence; to keep us safe and strengthen our influence for good? And
who, at the same time, wants to give you the opportunity to do your best for
yourself and your family?

Who will give you the power to choose - to say for yourself what you want?
And who will give you the personal prosperity that comes from low taxes -
from your own savings, your own pension, your own home? Who will let
you build up your own stake in Britain's success - and pass it on to your
children?

Only Conservatives can truly claim to be the party of opportunity; choice;
ownership and responsibility. Socialists like to keep people under the
government's thumb. Conservatives want to give them independence. But we
also want to put government at your service, giving you what you've paid for

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38
- good public services, responsible to you.

I do not believe the answer to every problem is simply for government to dig
deeper in your pocket. I believe it often lies in changing the way government
works; in making it respond to you. Government should look outwards. It
should listen. It should put you in the know not keep you in the dark.

We have made quite a start, under the seal of the Citizen's Charter People in
schools, hospitals, public offices of all kinds are rising to the challenge. I
knew they would. They just needed encouragement, incentive and a system
that is outward-looking too.

It is all part of a revolution in quality in Britain. British goods are once more
winning in the toughest markets abroad. There is new vigour in the
businesses liberated from state ownership; better management and better
industrial relations. These are the firm foundations of economic recovery.

We are raising the quality of our education and training. We are raising the
standard of our housing, as more people own and improve their own homes.
We are concerned for the quality of our environment. And in government,
we are leading a drive for quality throughout our public services.

That, I believe, is the way we all want to live - a decent life in a civilised
community. That is the way we can live: celebrating our achievements, not
nurturing old grudges; enjoying our successes, not talking Britain down. We
can be free of old prejudices and class bafflers. We can encourage diversity,
not division; achievement, not antagonism. We can all make our own
contribution to the success of the United Kingdom; and we must keep that
kingdom united.

You know I believe in choice. And in this election, as always, there is
another choice. You can vote for our opponents, and watch them take Britain
back to the 1970s. Back to socialism. Back to strikes. Back to strife. Back to
the world's pity, or worse still, contempt. I don't believe Britain wants that. I
know the world doesn't want that for Britain.

I hope you will choose a different path - to go forward, not back; to go for
the best, knowing that Britain can be the best and do it best. My belief is
clean only the best is good enough for Britain.

Taking Responsibility for Britain

The world has been transformed in recent years. Communism has collapsed
in Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union has fallen apart. Everywhere
Socialism is in retreat and democracy, human rights and market economics
are advancing. The authority of the UN has been bolstered and Iraqi
aggression seen off. Talks are under way in the Middle East and South
Africa. It is a time of great opportunity, but also of new dangers.

Britain needs firm leadership at this time. We must be represented by a team
of quality and experience. A team which can help shape the world for the
next century. A Conservative team.

Under the Conservatives, Britain has regained her rightful influence in the
world. We have stood up for the values our country has always represented.
We have defended Britain's interests with vigour and with success.

The respect with which Britain is regarded in the world has rarely been
higher. We play a central part in world affairs as a member of the European
Community, NATO, the Commonwealth and the Group of 7 leading
industrial countries, and as a Permanent Member of the UN Security
Council. No other country holds all these positions.

We are taking a leading role in recasting all the main international
institutions to which we belong: the United Nations, the European
Community, NATO, and the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister convened
the first ever meeting of the UN Security Council at Heads of Government
level. Between now and the end of 1992 there will be seven Summits where
issues of critical importance to our future will be determined: two EC

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Councils, at Lisbon and Edinburgh, the G7 Summit, the CSCE Summit, EC
Summits with the US and Japan, and the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro.
Britain will be at the centre of these negotiations.

The Need for Leadership

The end of the Cold War has enabled the UN to act with new unity and
authority. Under the authority of the UN, British forces played a leading and
courageous part in the Gulf War and the liberation of Kuwait. At the Prime
Minister's instigation, the UN also backed the operation to protect the Kurds.

Britain has led the world in helping the reforms in the former Soviet Union.
The Prime Minister gave full and immediate support to President Yeltsin in
the August coup attempt, and was the first Western leader to visit Moscow
after the coup failed. Britain has led the way in building up relations with the
republics of the new Commonwealth of Independent States. We have
provided valuable economic and humanitarian aid to ease the transition to a
market economy.

We will support an enhanced role for the UN in peace-keeping and
combating state-sponsored terrorism.

We are determined that Iraq should comply with the terms of the
Guff War cease-fire agreement, and in particular that it should co-
operate with the UN in dismantling its weapons of mass
destruction.

We support early Russian membership of the IMF and World
Bank, as well as a stabilisation fund for the rouble.

We are co-operating with our partners to provide urgent help to
the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to upgrade the safety
of their nuclear power stations.

We strongly support the peace process in the Middle East. The
outcome of the talks must safeguard the security of Israel and
achieve self-determination for the people of the occupied
territories.

We will safeguard the prosperity of Hong Kong, nurture
democratic institutions and work with the Chinese Government
within the terms of the Joint Declaration.

We seek a solution to the dispute which has divided Cyprus since
1974. A settlement must recognise that Cyprus is indivisible and
that the rights of both communities must be assured. We will
support the UN's efforts to secure a fair and lasting solution.

The problems of Kashmir cannot be resolved by violence. We urge
both India and Pakistan to address and resolve the issue, and we
stand ready to help.

Our Influence for Good

All over the world countries are turning to democracy and free markets. Last
October in Harare, the Commonwealth took on a new role as a promoter of
democracy the rule of law, and respect for individual freedoms. Already the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Commonwealth is monitoring elections to ensure that they are free and fair.
Britain is taking the lead in encouraging these trends.

We give substantial aid to the relief of poverty and to help the struggling
economies of the developing world. Our aid programme next year
(excluding aid to Eastern Europe and the CIS) will reach £1,800 million.
Britain also makes more direct private investment in the developing world
than any other EC country - some £2,400 million in 1989. We are urging the
international community to take decisive action on debt relief, the
liberalisation of world trade and support for good government.

We continue to accept the long term UN target for aid of 0.7 per cent of
GNP, although we cannot set a timetable for its achievement. The quality of
Britain's overseas aid programme is second to none. It is well targeted and
highly effective. Eighty per cent of our bilateral aid goes to the poorest
countries. New aid to the poorest is given as grants, not loans.

We are supporting projects designed to build efficient institutions and
accountable government. We are helping to improve public administration
and the legal system in a number of countries.

The English language is one of our nation's greatest assets - culturally
politically and commercially The BBC World Service has unrivalled
standing around the globe. The British Council acts as a cultural ambassador
for Britain and for the English language.

e We will use overseas aid to promote good government, sensible
economic policies, the rooting out of corruption, and - crucially -
respect for human rights and the rule of law.

e We will press creditor countries to accept the Prime Minister's
proposal - the 'Trinidad Terms' - for a two-thirds reduction in the
official debt of the poorest countries.

e We will promote the development of multi- party systems through
the new Westminster Foundation for Democracy.

e We will promote the English language by strengthening both the
British Council and the BBC World Service. We will encourage
both to become more entrepreneurial in order to finance their
activities in developing markets.

The Risks We Face Now

The collapse of the old Soviet Union has dramatically vindicated
Conservative defence policy. We have always put the security of our country
first. We have kept the peace by staying strong.

Today the threat of a massive surprise attack from Eastern Europe has gone.
But we still face grave risks to our security. We cannot drop our guard.
Under the Conservatives, Britain will never do so.

Within the former Soviet Union there remains a huge military force.
Democracy and the rule of law are yet to be firmly established. Control over

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

these armed forces and the massive nuclear capability is uncertain. The
events in Yugoslavia show what can happen when Communism collapses in
disorder.

Increasingly threats come from outside Europe - as we saw so clearly in the
Gulf. Many more countries are acquiring large stocks of modern arms. Some
are trying to obtain nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Britain must
be able to respond to any unexpected danger.

The Conservatives are the only party who recognise both the opportunities
and the threats of the new world.

For over forty years, our security has been based firmly on NATO, the most
successful defensive alliance ever. We will work with our allies to ensure
that NATO remains the cornerstone of our defence. Britain will command a
new NATO Rapid Reaction Corps ready to deploy quickly to counter any
sudden threat. As Europeans we must accept a greater role in safeguarding
the peace in our continent.

We will promote arms control and reduction initiatives. On Britain's
initiative, the UN is establishing a register of arms transfers in order to
monitor any dangerous arsenals of weapons.

Britain has always been strongly opposed to nuclear proliferation. We will
back an enhanced role for the International Atomic Energy Agency in
inspecting nuclear sites and for the UN Security Council in acting against
those nations which break their non proliferation obligations.

¢ We will work to strengthen the Western European Union as the
European pillar of NATO. We will press for a European reaction
force.

¢ We will intensify the co-ordination of security policies within the
Twelve.

e We will work through the CSCE to safeguard the security of
Europe.

e We will support a comprehensive and verifiable ban on chemical
weapons, and further controls on the export of items which could
be used in making biological weapons.

¢ We will help Russia in her efforts to dismantle nuclear weapons.

Our Armed Forces

Only the Conservatives can be trusted to maintain the quality and capability
of our Armed Forces. We are proud of the skill, courage and professionalism
which they displayed in the Gulf and which they show daily in Northern
Ireland.

We are the only party unambiguously committed to the preservation and
modernisation of our independent nuclear deterrent.

Our defence would be unsafe in the hands of the opposition parties. Labour

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

have opposed our defence policies at every turn. They have twisted and
turned in their attitude to our nuclear deterrent. They would devastate our
conventional forces by cuts of at least 27 per cent, which would lead to huge
job losses in the defence industries.

The Liberal Democrats would cause even more damage to Britain's
defences. Their aim is to cut our defence spending by half by the end of the
decade.

We insist that our forces have the modern, effective equipment that they
need. The Gulf War showed that the Services must have the latest
technology to give them maximum flexibility and mobility. That is why we
have ordered the new Challenger II tank for the Army, the Merlin helicopter
for the Navy, the ASRAAM air defence missile for the RAF and a wide
range of other new equipment for our Forces.

Our reappraisal of Britain's defence needs will result an a major restructuring
of our Armed Forces to take account of the changing world situation. In
future our Forces will be smaller, but better equipped. Our Services deserve
the excellent pay and conditions which we have secured for them and will
maintain.

e We will complete the deployment of the next generation of
Britain's minimum nuclear deterrent. We will order and complete
the fourth Trident submarine.

e We will ensure the Forces have the best and most modern
equipment.

e We will improve the quality and management of service housing
and help those in the Forces save towards buying a home of their
own.

¢ The Reserves will play an even more important role and we will
introduce legislation to allow their more flexible use.

The European Community

The Conservatives have been the party of Britain in Europe for 30 years. We
have argued when argument was necessary; but we have not wavered nor
changed our views. We have ensured that Britain is at the heart of Europe; a
strong and respected partner.

We have played a decisive part in the development of the Community over
the past decade. It was a British initiative which launched the Single Market
programme and our insistence which reformed the Community's finances.
Britain has promoted co-operation on foreign policy and in combating
terrorism. Britain has also persuaded our partners to welcome new countries
who apply for Community membership.

The Maastricht Treaty was a success both for Britain and for the rest of
Europe. British proposals helped to shape the key provisions of the Treaty
including those strengthening the enforcement of Community law defence,
subsidiarity and law and order. But Britain refused to accept the damaging

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Social Chapter proposed by other Europeans, and it was excluded from the
Maastricht treaty.

All Member States must live up to their obligations under Community law.
At Maastricht, we secured agreement that the European Court will be able to
fine any Member State which fails to do so.

e We will work closely with our partners in foreign policy and in the
war on international crime.

¢ We will continue to resist changes to the Treaty of Rome that
would damage British business.

© We will resist Commission initiatives which run counter to the
principle that issues should be dealt with on a national basis
wherever possible.

¢ Britain is a great trading nation. We prosper through the
maintenance of an open trading system. We will work for a
successful outcome to the GATT negotiations.

¢ We will redouble our efforts to reform the Common Agricultural
Policy and will stoutly defend the interests of British farmers and
consumers.

e We will insist on more effective control over Community spending
and will resist pressure to extend Community competence to new
areas.

¢ We will work to strengthen the external frontiers of the
Community whilst maintaining the checks needed at our own
borders against illegal immigration, drugs, terrorism and disease.

The British Presidency

In the second half of 1992 Britain will take the Chair of the Council of
Ministers. The British Presidency comes at a turning point in the
Community's history. It gives us the opportunity to shape the direction of the
Community and to establish its priorities. We shall use it to promote our
vision of an outward looking Community based on free enterprise.

Our Presidency will reach its climax at the Edinburgh meeting of the
European Council, which we will hold in the historic palace of Holyrood
House. While the attention of Europe is focused on Edinburgh, the strength
of our Union will be visible to all.

Our priorities will be:

¢ To start negotiations with those EFTA countries who want to join
the Community so that they can join by 1995.

¢ To build on the EC's Association Agreements with
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland so that we can welcome
them to full membership by the year 2000.

¢ To conclude EC trade and co-operation agreements with the main
republics of the former Soviet Union.

¢ To complete the single market and extend it to the seven countries
of EFTA - Over half our trade is with the rest of the Community.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

The single market will create an open market of 350 million
customers for British goods and services. To complete the single
market we shall aim to:
© open up the market for life insurance to free competition;
o liberalise air travel to bring down air fares in Europe closer
to those in America;
o free up the shipping and road transport markets so that
British operators can carry freely within the EC;
o increase competition in the European energy sector.

e We will provide guidance and help to any British company
encountering a trade barrier illegal under European law.

e We will press for progress on the environment, including the Fifth
Environment Action Programme.

e We will chair the negotiations on the future spending priorities of
the Community to ensure value for money. We will safeguard the
abatement negotiated by Mrs Thatcher which has so far brought
some £12,000 million in budget rebates to Britain.

Wealth and Ownership

The 1990s present a great economic opportunity for Britain. We have got the
scourge of inflation under control. We have cut direct tax rates. And a stable
currency gives industry a chance to realise the potential released by the
reforms of the 1980s.

We have extended ownership more widely - of homes, savings and shares -
with millions more sharing directly in Britain's success. We will promote
enterprise through low taxes, sound money and a stable currency.

When the Exchange Rate Mechanism was being created, during the final
days of the last Labour Government, the then Prime Minister decided Britain
could not take part.

It was easy to see why The economy was too weak. Inflation was too high.
In 1974-79, the inflation rate averaged over 15 per cent. It peaked at 27 per
cent. Public borrowing rose to nearly 10 per cent of national income -
equivalent to £55,000 million today Penal taxes blunted enterprise. Britain
was a byword for strikes.

The Conservatives have changed all that. Since 1979, our inflation rate has
averaged 7/4 per cent. Now it is only just over 4 per cent - below the average
for the European Community In the 1960s and 1970s, Britain had the
slowest growth rate in the European Community. But in the 1980s, we grew
faster than either France or Germany Industrial disputes became rare events.
And in 1990, a Conservative Government joined the ERM.

Penal taxes have been abolished. A man on average earnings, with a wife
and two children, has an income today which after tax and inflation is 39 per
cent higher than it was in Labour's last year. That great advance in the
standard of living is at risk in this election.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Since the war, living standards have always risen faster under Conservative
Governments than under Labour. Now we are pledged to cut tax rates again -
and have made a start on the road to 20p Income Tax.

Corporate tax rates have been cut, too. Our business investment has
increased more rapidly than in any other major economy except Japan.
Britain attracts by far the biggest share of Japanese and American
investment in Europe. That, too, is at risk in this election.

Britain's Opportunity

We are now members of:

¢ The biggest free market in the world. British industry is again
respected in Europe.
¢ Azone of low inflation, in which we can compete with the best.

Britain must not throw this opportunity away by electing a Labour
government. The world recession has been tough for all of us, at home and
abroad. Unemployment has risen. But in Britain we have laid the
foundations for recovery What is needed to trigger confidence and growth is
a Conservative victory with a decisive majority. What would postpone
recovery, and turn this promise of growth into the certainty of hard times, is
the election of our opponents whose policies would mean higher taxes,
higher inflation, higher interest rates, more bureaucratic regulation and more
strikes.

In the 1990s, the Government's task will be to provide an economic
environment which encourages enterprise - the mainspring of
prosperity. Our aims must be:

e To achieve price stability.

e To keep firm control over public spending.

e To continue to reduce taxes as fast as we prudently can.

¢ To make sure that market mechanisms and incentives are allowed
to do their job.

Price stability does not mean a frozen economy in which no price ever
moves. But we must drive inflation down so low that it no longer affects the
decisions made by ordinary people, businesses and government.

When inflation rises, so do bankruptcies. When inflation falls, industry can
plan again for a profitable future. Inflation creates strife, as different groups
in society struggle to restore their living standards. It destroys jobs. It erodes
savings and social benefits and threatens our currency.

Inflation and Europe
Membership of the ERM is now central to our counter-inflation discipline.

But the ERM is not a magic wand. It would not protect Labour; it would
merely expose the folly of Labour policies. Some Labour politicians know

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

that all too well - others simply don't. They - and some of the unions - would
put irresistible spending pressure on a Labour government.

Some members of the European Community are anxious to hurry on from
the ERM to Economic and Monetary Union. Others have doubts. Quite apart
from the constitutional issues, they do not want to take risks with what is
being achieved in the ERM.

The Treaty negotiated at Maastricht laid down the process under which the
Community can, if its members meet certain economic conditions, create a
monetary union with a single currency for some or all of them. Together
with Germany we fought for tough criteria. We believe a monetary union
would collapse, with damaging consequences, if it were imposed on
economies that were too diverse.

A union will only come about by 1997 if a substantial majority of
Community members agree it should. It would only include those members
who were judged to have met specified conditions. And it would only come
about if a majority of members were judged to have done so.

But the Treaty goes on to say that monetary union will come about
automatically in 1999, for all who meet the conditions. We did not want to
exclude ourselves from membership; but we could not accept such an
automatic commitment. By the end of this decade the EC's membership will
have changed; the economic performance of man of its members may have
changed. We cannot tell who the members of such a union might be.

We therefore secured the freedom to make a proper judgement on events. We
are as free to join if we wish as an other member. We would have to meet the
same conditions - no more, no less. We will play our full part in the
discussions of the monetary institutions Europe may create in the 1990s. But
we are not obliged to join in a single currency if we do not want to.

e In due course, we will move to the narrow bands of the ERM.

¢ We will play our full part in the design and discussion of monetary
institutions for Europe.

e When or if other members of the EC move to a monetary union
with a single currency, we will take our own unfettered decision on
whether to join. That decision will be taken by the United
Kingdom Parliament.

The Route of Lower Taxes

Economic growth is created by people's hard work, ingenuity thrift and
willingness to take risks. An enterprise economy rewards the industrious and
thrifty We believe that government should not gobble up all the proceeds of
growth, and that those who create prosperity should enjoy it, through lower
taxes and more opportunity to build up personal wealth.

Our policy is therefore to reduce the share of national income taken by the
public sector. In the mid-1970s, public spending peaked at over 49 per cent

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

of our gross national product. In the early 1980s, it peaked at over 47 per
cent. In this recession, it is peaking at only 43 per cent. We aim to reduce
this steadily as the recovery gets under way.

Keeping control of public spending will enable us to cut taxes while
bringing the Government's Budget back towards balance in the years ahead.
Excessive government borrowing can lead to inflation. Government should
always be on guard against that danger. However, when demand in the
economy is weak, public borrowing will tend to rise.

Because companies pay taxes according to how well they did the previous
year, the deficit tends to be deepest just as we come out of recession. We
must make sure that as the economy grows, borrowing slows.

By bringing tax and spending decisions together in a unified Budget from
next year, we will make the choices clearer. But lower taxes and a prudent
approach to borrowing do not mean public spending must fall; quite the
reverse. A lightly-taxed economy generates more economic growth, and
more revenue. High taxes kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. In the
course of its last five years in office, Labour was forced to cut public
spending, in real terms. By contrast, the Conservatives have been able to
raise public spending by nearly a quarter in real terms.

Higher tax rates do not always bring in more money In practice, they can
bring in less. The Conservative Government has more than halved the top
rate of tax. Yet top rate taxpayers today provide a bigger share of our tax
revenues than they did before. Lower taxes have encouraged more people to
work harder - not to spend their time working out how to avoid penal taxes.

During the past 13 years we have cut, simplified or abolished a whole range
of direct taxes.

e We have cut the basic rate of Income Tax from 33p to 25p, and the top
rate from 83p to 40p.

e We have now announced a new starting Income Tax rate of 20p.

e We have raised the basic single person's tax allowance by 27 per cent
more than would be needed to keep pace with inflation.

e We have simplified and reduced the burden of taxation on capital.

e We have cut Corporation Tax from 52 per cent to 33 per cent (and
from 42 per cent to 25 per cent for small companies).

e We have reduced the burden of National Insurance on low earners.

e We have introduced independent taxation of husbands and wives,
giving married women full eligibility for tax allowances.

e We have introduced new tax incentives for savings.

e We have abolished several taxes completely including the surcharge
on income from savings, the National Insurance Surcharge,
Development Land Tax, and Capital Transfer Tax.

We are the only party that understands the need for low taxation. Labour and

the Liberals openly advocate increased taxation. Yet lower taxes clearly
create a more productive economy. They also achieve another prime

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

objective of Conservative Governments, which is to transfer power from the
state to the people.

Labour would:

¢ Reverse our cut in the starting rate of Income Tax to 20p.
¢ Raise the top rate.

¢ Abolish the National Insurance ceiling.

e Introduce a new savings surcharge.

e We announced in the Budget an important first step towards a
basic Income Tax rate of 20p. By applying a 20p rate to the first
£2,000 of taxable income, we have cut taxes for all 25 million
taxpayers, and taken the four million on lowest incomes out of 25p
tax altogether.

e We will make further progress towards a basic Income Tax rate of
20p.

e We will reduce the share of national income taken by the public
sector. We will see the budget return towards balance as the
economy recovers.

The Right To Own

Since 1979, wealth has been spread more widely through the community
Home ownership, share ownership and the build-up of personal pensions
have all contributed. Over two-thirds of people live in homes that they own,
10 million people own shares, 6 million of them in newly-privatised
industries. About 2.5 million have benefited from tax incentives to
encourage employee share schemes. And over 4% million people are now
building up their own personal pensions.

But these freedoms are at risk.
Labour would:

¢ Halt the privatisation programme and threaten the value of shares in
privatised industries with renationalisation and new Government
controls.

¢ Bring back credit rationing, leading to mortgage queues.

¢ Turn the pensions market on its head, making pension provision costly
and difficult.

These changes would drive savings overseas and make wealth again the
prerogative of the few.

By contrast, we want to do more to encourage the wider distribution of
wealth throughout society Sustaining not just a home-owning but a capital
owning democracy is crucial to our vision for the 1990s. We intend to spread
the ownership of shares, homes, pensions and savings. We will do so
through future privatisations, help for would-be home owners in council
tenancies and further encouragement for the spread of personal pensions. We

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 14 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

intend to lighten the burden of capital taxes and reform the taxation of
savings.

We believe Inheritance Tax is particularly inequitable. It falls only on those
who do not dispose of their assets seven years or more before their death. It
is inevitably the case that these tend to be people who are not rich enough to
engage in high-powered tax planning, or who, for lack of knowledge or
advice, fail to take the necessary precautionary action. In the Budget, we
announced that we would take most family businesses out of Inheritance Tax
altogether. During the new Parliament, we will aim to lessen the burden on
families to whom home ownership has brought the threat of this erratic tax.

¢ As detailed later in this Manifesto, we will aim to bring home
ownership, share ownership and personal pensions within the
reach of more families.

¢ We will continue to reform the taxation of savings, building on the
success of PEPs and TESSAs.

e We will raise the tax threshold for Inheritance Tax so that the
homes and savings of an increasing number of our citizens can
pass unencumbered from one generation to another.

e Whenever possible, we will ensure that future privatisations offer
opportunities to employees to secure a stake in the ownership of
their business.

e We will encourage companies to make dealing in their own shares
easier, especially for small shareholders, and encourage wider
share ownership, through, for example, the establishment of
‘Share Shops'.

e We will abolish Stamp Duty on share transactions.

Setting the Economy Free

Starting with the abolition of exchange controls in 1979, the Government
has created new incentives for every part of our economy.

Manufacturing industry suffered particularly badly from the harm inflicted
on the British economy by Labour Governments in the 1960s and 1970s. To
a far greater extent than service industries, it was the victim of militant
trades unionism, restrictive practices, nationalisation, state intervention, tax
distortion, planning controls and over-regulation.

We believe strongly that a vigorous manufacturing sector is essential to a
healthy British economy Over the past 13 years, we have steadily dismantled
barriers to its growth.

The competitiveness and performance of British manufacturing have been
transformed. Its impressive recovery was recognised by the Confederation of
British Industry, in its report aptly titled Competing with the World's Best’.
Manufacturing productivity has risen by more than half since 1979 - faster
than in any other major industrial country. Over the past 10 years, British
manufactured exports have grown faster than those of France, Germany the
United States or even Japan.

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

The British motor industry has achieved an astonishing revival. By 1996,
Britain should again be exporting more cars than we import - for the first
time since 1974. We have given the industry yet more encouragement in the
Budget, by halving the special tax paid on new cars.

The British Standard for Quality management has effectively become the
international standard. But that is only the beginning. We have set up a team
of senior business people to pursue the idea of a new British Quality Award.

The City is Europe's greatest financial centre. It contributes £11,000 million
net to our balance of payments. Financial services employ 12 per cent of our
workforce. London's capital markets and financial services have grown
vigorously because they are innovative and highly competitive. We will
continue our efforts to break down the barriers that prevent them from
competing freely throughout Europe and in the wider world.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is now based in
London. It puts us in the forefront of encouraging investment in the
developing markets of Central and Eastern Europe.

Service industries make a vital contribution to our economy and to our
balance of payments. Tourism, for example, today employs /.5 million
people, 20% more than in 1980. It is an industry which boasts many famous
companies - but it is also driven by the dynamism of many small firms. We
will continue to help them by simplifying rules and regulations on business
and through the DTI Enterprise Initiative and a range of other schemes.

e We will continue to reduce tax burdens on business, as we have
done this year for the motor industry, whenever it is possible to do
so.

e We will abolish unnecessary licences and reduce the need for
specific approvals for product design.

e We will back British companies encountering any discrimination,
trade barriers or state subsidies that should no longer exist within
the Single Market.

e We will back the regulators of the financial services industry in
their efforts to achieve high standards while keeping the rule
books down to manageable size.

Privitisation

Competition and private ownership are the most powerful engines of
economic efficiency, innovation and choice. They lead to the creation of
world-class companies.

We have returned to private enterprise two-thirds of the companies once
owned by the state: 46 businesses employing about 900,000 people. This

programme has been the model for governments across the whole world.

The work of liberalising markets which were once monopolised goes on. In
1984 we privatised British Telecom but only Mercury was given a licence to

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

carry services over fixed links. In 1991 we decided to end this duopoly The
UK now has one of the most open and dynamic telecommunications markets
in the world.

But much greater economic efficiency is not the only gain. Employees have
been able to take a direct stake in the newly privatised companies. Millions
of people have been given the same chance to own a real share in the
nation's assets. Companies which looked inwards to Whitehall are now
listening to their customers and shareholders.

Some activities of government must always be provided in the public sector.
But in central government, Next Steps Agencies and local government,
management is increasingly buying-in services from the private sector. Our
proposals for developing this policy have been set out in the White Papers
on ‘Competing for Quality' in central and local government.

e We will continue our privatisation programme. British Coal will
be returned to the private sector. So will local authority bus
companies. We will encourage local authorities to sell their
airports. We will end British Rail's monopoly. We will sell certain
rail services and franchise others. These proposals are set out later
in this Manifesto.

¢ The Ports Act 1991 has paved the way for the privatisation of the
Trust Ports by competitive tender. Tees and Hartlepool, Tilbury,
Medway, Forth and Clyde have already been privatised.

¢ We are privatising Northern Ireland Electricity and will privatise
the Northern Ireland water and sewage services. We will look for
ways of bringing private sector skills into the management of
Northern Ireland Railways.

¢ We will bring private sector enterprise into the public services by
encouraging contracting out and competitive tendering
throughout government.

¢ We will require all government departments to report annually on
their plans for market-testing, and progress in achieving it, in
their own services and in those of their associated agencies.

e We will maintain our programme of compulsory competitive
tendering of local authority services. We will ensure that unfair
terms are excluded and will discourage investment to protect in-
house services when better, more cost effective services are
available through the private sector.

e We will ensure that competitive tendering is extended to white
collar local authority services, such as those offered by lawyers,
accountants, architects and surveyors.

¢ We will tackle all anti-competitive and restrictive practices with
vigour. We will introduce new legislation giving stronger powers to
deal with cartels.

Deregulation

We are concerned that at every level of government - in Europe, in Whitehall

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

and in local authorities - some regulations may have been adopted in answer
to legitimate concerns, but without proper regard to their overall impact on
businesses and individuals. A proper balance needs to be struck between
essential protection for the public, and over-zealous and intrusive controls
aimed at the elimination of all conceivable risk. It is wrong that new
regulations, designed to deal with isolated problems, should interfere with
the private arrangements of citizens or with reasonable commercial practices
that have earned broad public acceptance.

¢ The compliance costs of new UK and EC regulations must be
assessed properly. Existing regulations which are outmoded and
burdensome must be simplified or removed. We will give priority
to the work of the DTI Deregulation Unit in these areas.

¢ We will examine ways in which the uniform scope of regulation
could be eased to safeguard traditional local products or practices.

e We will examine whether certain regulations affecting individual
citizens within their own homes could be made advisory, rather
than mandatory.

Energy

Our energy policies have brought the consumer both lower prices and better
service. We have privatised British Gas and the electricity industry in a way
that has opened these markets to competition. These policies are now being
seized upon in Europe as essential extensions of the Single Market.

Domestic customers are now protected by a price formula, and high
standards of service are enforced by the independent regulators. For
instance, electricity disconnections for debt have fallen by 43 per cent since
the launch of privatisation.

We have ensured that the safety of employees comes first, and have given
thousands the opportunity of acquiring a stake in their industry.

The future of the coal industry depends crucially on the competitiveness of
coal as a fuel for electricity generation. British Coal has made enormous
progress in increasing productivity since the end of the 1985 strike - but
there is still further to go. We will support the efforts of British Coal and its
workforce to improve the industry's performance. The long term future of
the industry lies in the private sector.

We have invested in clean coal technology to safeguard the environment.
Renewable energy projects have received unprecedented support. North Sea
oil and gas are enjoying a record expansion thanks to our policies of
deregulation and low taxation.

¢ Safety will remain our highest priority throughout the energy
sector.

¢ We will continue to encourage competition in energy markets. We
will progressively reduce British Gas' monopoly of the retail gas
market, to give small users the same rights as big firms.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 18 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

e We will privatise British Coal in a way that enables employees to
enjoy a stake in the industry.

e We will increase our support for British Coal Enterprise which
promotes economic regeneration in areas affected by the closure
of mines, and has successfully assisted 76,000 people in finding
new jobs.

e We will review the future of the nuclear industry in 1994. We are
committed to safe and economical nuclear power. The existing
strict arrangements for nuclear waste will be maintained.

e We will maintain a guaranteed market for renewable energy
projects and fluid research in this area.

¢ We will consult on new building regulations to improve energy
use. Together with British Gas and some of the Regional
Electricity Companies, we will establish an independent Energy
Savings Trust to promote energy efficiency. Our grants scheme for
low income households will receive record funding next year.

Science and Innovation

British science has an unrivalled reputation for ground-breaking research.
We believe in investing in scientific research because it enriches the quality
of our lives and provides the feedstock of industrial innovation. The science
budget has grown by 24 per cent in real terms since 1978-9. Increasingly
funding will reflect the quality of the research output so that the best centres
can truly be world leaders.

The Government spends nearly £3,000 million a year on civil research and
development - at least as high a proportion of national income as the
Japanese or Americans. And since 1978, British industry's spending on R&D
has increased by 37 per cent in real terms.

¢ We will continue to support our science base to maintain the
excellence of our science and to ensure that we produce the skilled
technical people we need.

e We will encourage the transfer of people and technology from
universities to businesses and upgrade the LINK scheme, which
funds joint research.

¢ We will encourage the establishment of centres of technological
excellence linking industrial research organisations with
universities and polytechnics.

¢ We will continue to develop new innovation schemes for small and
medium-sized businesses, including the highly-regarded SPUR
programme to provide help with the development of new products
and processes.

Regional Policies

In recent years, the United Kingdom has attracted five times as much
Japanese investment as Germany or France, which powerfully demonstrates
that we have created the most attractive environment in Europe for investors.

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Our positive policy towards inward investment will be maintained, in
contrast to that of the TUC and the Labour Party.

The Government will continue to invest in a strong infrastructure, and boost
technology expertise in the regions.

e We will ensure that regional policy is well targeted.

e We will continue to support all parts of the United Kingdom in
their campaigns to attract inward investment.

e We will give additional emphasis to upgrading skills and
technology when allocating funds.

Small Businesses

Small businesses are the seedcorn of the economy Their numbers have
grown by more than a third since 1979, while the number of self-employed
people has grown to over 12 per cent of the workforce. We will continue to
recognise the special needs of small and medium-sized companies, and to
ensure that Government delivers useful services to them.

Our tax regime for small businesses is one of the most favourable in Europe.
We have raised the VAT threshold every year since 1979 and reduced the
small companies rate of Corporation Tax from 42 per cent to 25 per cent.

Training and Enterprise Councils (and Local Enterprise Companies in
Scotland) have developed a wide range of services for business and
enterprise which assist over 150,000 small companies each year. We have
developed the popular Enterprise Initiative, under which 40,000 companies
have been helped to buy in outside expertise offering key management skills.
We now propose to develop this initiative further.

We also propose to help businesses by easing the transfer of commercial
tenancies.

e We announced in the Budget new measures to help small
businesses, including full relief against Inheritance Tax on most
business assets, reductions in business rates and proposals to
speed up the payment of outstanding bills.

¢ During the new Parliament, we will develop a new Enterprise
Service to give small and medium-sized companies help in
diagnosing their most important strategic needs. A new
Consultancy Brokerage Service will supply information to small
companies. We will also develop a Technology Audit which will
provide small firms with a plan for change. And we will continue
to support Total Quality Management consultancies.

¢ TECs and LECs will be closely involved in developing and
implementing this new initiative.

The independent Law Commission has recommended that a commercial

tenant should in general be freed from any future liability under a lease when
he assigns away his interest under it. We will consider how this principle

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 20 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

could be put into effect for new commercial leases.

Consumer Affairs

Consumers want choice, quality and value for money Competition only
works effectively if consumers have the information they need to make
sensible decisions.

Our food safety policy promotes consumer choice and consumer safety. We
introduced the 1990 Food Safety Act to ensure the highest standards of food

hygiene.

We will introduce legislation designed to give consumers
confidence that what they purchase is properly described - and
that adequate compensation is offered where these requirements
are not met.

We will enable the courts to override unfair terms in contracts
and improve our powers to deal with rogue traders.

We will ensure that guarantees mean what they say, and that
manufacturers or importers share responsibility with the people
who sell their goods.

We will tighten up the rules on holiday brochures and contracts,
and introduce a 'cooling-off' period into timeshare contracts.
We will introduce legislation to simplify trade mark registration
and extend the rights they confer.

We will enforce science-based controls on the use of chemicals in
food production, and will maintain our policy of open access to
information on pesticide safety.

We will improve standards of food labelling in close consultation
with consumer representatives.

Choice and The Charter

The Citizen's Charter is the most far-reaching programme ever devised to
improve quality in public services. It addresses the needs of those who use
public services, extends people's rights, requires services to set clear
standards - and to tell the public how far those standards are met.

The Citizen's Charter:

widens popular choice;

helps people to exercise that choice in a properly informed way;
expects all public services to put the customer first;

promotes the challenge of competition within the public sector;
requires clear performance standards to be set and for services to be
measured against them;

insists on a proper response to complaints and on action to set right the

problems behind them.

The Charter will be at the centre of government's decision-making

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 12:38

Page 21 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

throughout the 1990s. No one doubts the professionalism of the vast
majority of public servants. But too often the system's outdated working
methods and attitudes prevent them from giving their best. The Charter's
commitment to modern, open services will help them to win the respect that
good service deserves.

In less than a year since the White Paper, 18 detailed Charters have been
published. Each sets out tough new standards and gives new information and
rights to the public. Each will be revised regularly to check on progress, and
raise standards higher. But, already results are clear.

¢ In hospitals, from April, every out-patient will have a fixed
appointment time and our guarantee of maximum waiting times for
operations will be steadily improved.

¢ On council estates every tenant will have the right to call in a private
contractor if the council fails to do a minor repair.

¢ In schools, all parents will have the right to a report on their child's
performance and details on that of the school.

Rights such as these should not have been denied to the public. The Citizen's
Charter, steadily but surely, is changing all that.

KNOWLEDGE, STANDARDS, CHOICE

The next Conservative Government will carry the Charter still further. There
will be more information about standards and performance; clear standards
set within public services which are still shrouded in mystery; more choice
built into public services and proper complaints procedures introduced.
Many of these are outlined later in the Manifesto under Education, Health,
Local Government and Transport. Here are a few examples from the
programme for the next two years:

e¢ The Audit Commission will be able to publish league tables of
performance including each local council and health authority so
that people can compare the quality of service.

e We will ensure that inspection reports are published and widely
available. All councils will have to respond in public to criticism
from auditors.

e We will introduce a new 'Charterline' that people with questions
or problems with a public service will be able to ring.

¢ We will require British Rail to tighten its targets for reliability and
punctuality on all lines, and report monthly to passengers on how
it is doing. London Underground will publish its own Charter.

¢ We will expect Post Offices and Job Centres to set out standards of
service and levels of achievement.

¢ Anew Charter Mark award will give recognition to those parts of
the public service that best meet Charter standards.

¢ British Rail and London Underground are introducing
compensation systems for travellers.

¢ We will review the powers of the Local Government Ombudsman

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 22 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

to ensure that findings of maladministration are properly dealt
with by all local authorities. We will consult on a new Lay
Adjudicators scheme to help the public resolve difficulties and
disputes.

We will extend competition and accountability in public services. Those who
provide public services will have to prove they can give the right quality at
the right cost.

We will extend compulsory competitive tendering to local
authority housing management, and examine how to apply it to
white-collar services. We will act to ensure that private firms
bidding to improve local authority public services are not
obstructed by unscrupulous practices in councils or by unfair
contracts. We will pursue more competitive tendering for central
government services.

We will encourage the wider use of performance pay inside the
Civil Service and in other parts of the public service. A link
between a person's effort and his or her pay is a powerful means
of improving performance.

Civil servants dealing with the public will normally identify
themselves by name.

We will toughen inspection of key public services where choice
and competition must inevitably be limited. We will introduce, for
the first time, regular independent inspection of all schools.

We will act to ensure that the inspectorates of police, fire,
probation, and social services, together with any new inspectorates
that are established, will be truly independent of the service which
they inspect.

We will ensure that the reports from these systematic regular
inspections are published. More lay inspectors, drawn from other
professions and from the general public, will bring fresh insights
into service improvement.

We will publish later this year new proposals for the inspection of
social work in England, setting up arrangements for systematic
independent inspection of all care services and every local
authority social services department.

Inspections of local authority homes will be carried out by teams
that contain lay inspectors and are independent of the influence of
the management of the homes.

All of the privatised utilities have a specialist regulator who is responsible
for promoting competition, reviewing prices and protecting the public
interest. We have introduced legislation to increase the powers of these
regulators to the level of the strongest.

We are ensuring that the regulators have the powers they need to
promote competition and safeguard the interests of the customer

by controlling price increases. We will increase competition in the
gas and water markets.

We are giving the regulators powers to set standards of service,

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 23 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

covering such matters as fixed appointment times for service calls.

?
THE POST OFFICE

The Post Office is among the best in Europe for speed and reliability of its
letter services. Traffic has grown by 50 per cent in a decade in which it has
operated without a subsidy Last year the first-class letter service achieved
record improvements in reliability The local post office is a vital and valued
feature of the rural community.

In 1981 we introduced private competition for deliveries costing over £1.
This led to the rapid growth of the private courier industry with substantial
benefits to business users. We believe that further benefits to consumers
would flow from additional competition.

We are committed to maintaining a nation wide letter service with
delivery to every address in the United Kingdom, within a
uniform structure of prices, and with a nation-wide network of
post offices.

We will legislate to set up a new independent regulator to advise
on issues affecting Post Office customers, and on the progressive
introduction of competition.

We will set performance targets for the Post Office and ensure
they are published in all offices, together with results achieved.
We will ensure there is effective redress for customers where
services fail.

We will lower the limit on the Post Office monopoly much closer to
the level of the first class stamp.

We will provide improved scope for contractors to carry mail to
final delivery offices.

We will consider requests to license limited specialist services to
compete within the Post Office monopoly.

WHITEHALL & WESTMINSTER

Whitehall must move with the times. It is over a decade since the last major
restructuring of the departments of government. Since then:

Two-thirds of the state industrial sector has been privatised,
transferring about 900,000 jobs to the private sector.

Government has reduced the burden of regulation and the need for
central bureaucracy

Civil Service manpower has been reduced by almost a quarter.
Many of the functions of government have been devolved from
Whitehall.

The Citizen's Charter programme is bringing new quality to public
services.

We will continue to reorganise central government in tune with its modern

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 24 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

role, while devolving and contracting-out executive functions. We want to
ensure that the drive to save money to reduce bureaucracy and raise quality
is powerfully led from the centre of government.

We will give a Cabinet Minister responsibility for the Citizen's
Charter programme and reforming the Civil Service, taking
charge of the Citizen's Charter Unit, Efficiency Unit, the
programme for creating Agencies and the Public Competition and
Purchasing Unit. This will make it easier to raise quality and
efficiency in government and see that contracting-out and market-
testing are energetically pursued.

We intend to create a new department, under a Cabinet Minister,
with responsibility for broadcasting, arts, sport, tourism, the
national heritage and the film industry. This department will aim
to encourage private sector enterprise in all these fields. The
National Lottery and the Millennium Fund (detailed later in this
Manifesto) will also bring new responsibilities to government in
these areas.

We will transfer the core responsibilities of the Department of
Energy to the Department of Trade and Industry and
responsibilities for energy efficiency to the Department of the
Environment, ending the need for a separate department

Small businesses are the seedcorn of our future prosperity We
believe the Department of Trade and Industry should take over
responsibility for them. We also want to strengthen the links
between the DTI and the highly successful Training and
Enterprise Councils.

Responsibility for overseeing all financial services will be brought
together in the Treasury, in line with the practice adopted in most
other advanced countries.

New programmes for regenerating our inner cities are outlined in
this Manifesto. Responsibilities will be brought together in the
Department of the Environment.

We are determined to ensure that women in the work-force realise
their full potential. We will transfer from the Home Office to the
Department of Employment the lead responsibility for co-
ordinating government policy on issues of particular concern to
women.

?
OPEN GOVERNMENT

Government has traditionally been far too reluctant to provide information.
This secrecy extends from the processes of Cabinet Government to schools
which refuse to release exam results. Under the Citizen's Charter, a great
deal more information is now being made available on the services provided
by government.

We have also:

replaced the catch-all provisions of the 1911 Official Secrets Act with

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 25 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

narrower offences depending on specific tests of the harm likely to be
caused by disclosure, while giving special protection to vital
information relating to our national security;

¢ introduced rights to check certain personal records held on computer,
and supported new rights of access to a range of government records;

* committed ourselves to a public right of access to information about
the environment, including water supply, air quality dumping at sea
and radioactive substances;

¢ made available more reports on matters of public concern such as food
safety and industrial risks.

We intend to carry forward this move towards greater openness.

¢ We will review the 80 or so statutory restrictions which exist on
the disclosure of information - retaining only those needed to
protect privacy and essential confidentiality.

¢ We will seek to provide greater access to personal records held by
government.

¢ We will be less secretive about the workings of government. For
example, when the Committees of the Cabinet are reconstituted
after the election we will, for the first time, set out their names and
membership. We will update and - for the first time - publish the
guidance for Ministers on procedure.

THE WORKINGS OF PARLIAMENT

It is not just Whitehall that must change. Parliament, too, has to keep its
working methods under review to make sure it attracts the best people to the
service of their country and uses their talents to best effect.

¢ We will propose appropriate Parliamentary reforms to ensure that
the House of Commons conducts its business more efficiently and
effectively, taking into account the benefits of modern technology,
the increasing constituency demands upon Members of
Parliament and the need to attract more women to stand for
election.

OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL

Conservatives believe that high standards in education and training are the
key to personal opportunity and national success. We believe in partnership
with parents, choice in schools and a good grounding in the basic skills all
children need to make a success of their lives. We are committed to
widening opportunities without compromising academic standards. We will
continue to expand higher education and training. We will reinforce the
rights of the individual in the world of work, and break down artificial
barriers to advancement. By extending opportunity and arming people with
the power to choose, we will give valuable freedoms and a powerful spur to
achievement.

?
SCHOOLS, PUPILS & PARENTS

We are now seeing real improvements in our education system. One in four
young people goes on to higher education; at the beginning of the 1980s, it
was only one in eight. Sixty per cent of 16 year-olds stay on in full-time
education, up from only 40 per cent in 1979. And we have embarked on the
most important and wide-ranging reforms since the 1940s.

For the first time in our history, we will soon have a National Curriculum
which will require all the main school subjects to be covered thoroughly The
testing of 7 year-olds is well under way and tests for older children are now
being developed. Starting this September, GCSE courses will be steadily
integrated with the National Curriculum.

Under the Parent's Charter, all schools will have to provide at least one
written report on the progress of each child each year. Information on the
performance of all local schools will be given to parents, enabling them to
exercise choice more effectively

We believe all parents have the right to choice in education - not only those
who can afford school fees. Young people differ in their interests and
aptitudes, and we need a range of schools to offer them the best
opportunities. We have always fought to maintain diversity in education,
protecting the right of local people to preserve their grammar schools, and
defending independent schools against mindless Labour attacks. And we
have always valued the important contribution made by the churches to our
children's education.

We have further increased diversity by:

¢ Giving schools control over their own budgets and encouraging new
types of school.

e Allowing schools to become independent of local councils, by
applying for Grant-Maintained status if the parents involved so wish.
By mid-1992, over 200 GM schools will be up and running.

¢ Creating a number of highly popular City Technology Colleges.

e Launching the highly successful initiative under which schools are
able to bid directly for the resources to become Technology Schools.

We intend to take all these initiatives further and offer parents more choice
in the new Parliament. Popular schools will be allowed to expand, and more
schools will be able to apply for technology funding. We will make it easier
for small schools to enjoy the benefits of GM status by grouping together.

e We will complete the introduction of the National Curriculum
offering 10 subjects at a nationally-defined standard - English,
Mathematics, Science, History, Geography, Technology, Art,
Music, PE and, in secondary schools, a foreign language.

¢ Regular and straightforward tests will be in place for all 7, 11 and

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 27 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

14 year-olds by 1994.

e GCSE at age 16 will be integrated into the National Curriculum,
with a new A+ grade to test the most able. The majority of marks
will come from a written exam.

e We will continue to encourage the creation of nursery places. For
the first time, over 50 per cent of three and four year olds have
places either in nursery or primary schools.

¢ Full information will be published annually about the
performance of all local schools in each area.

e Independent inspection of schools will provide parents with
straightforward reports on their child's school, together with an
action plan from governors to remedy any weaknesses.

¢ Popular schools which are over subscribed will he given the
resources to expand.

¢ GM schools will be able to change their character if that is what
parents clearly want and the change fits in with the wider needs of
the local area.

¢ The Technology Schools Initiative will be expanded across the
country.

¢ Existing schools which opt for GM status will be able to emulate
City Technology Colleges and attract private technology
sponsorship.

e We will maintain the Assisted Places scheme, which gives access to
independent education to many families who could not otherwise
afford it.

¢ We will ensure that the partnership between the state and the
churches in education is maintained and strengthened.

e We will enable small schools to apply for GM status in groups.

e We will pay particular attention to raising educational standards
in areas of deprivation in our cities.

?
TEACHING

We are determined to reinforce the professionalism of teachers and the
esteem in which they are held. We have created an independent Teachers'
Pay Review Body We accepted in full its first recommendations; nearly half
of all teachers are now earning over £20,000 a year. We will press ahead
with regular appraisal of teachers to encourage high standards and develop
professional skills.

As a first step in the reform of teacher training, postgraduate students will
spend much more time in school classrooms, learning their skills under the
practised eye of senior teachers.

It is vital that the education system should attract back women who have
taken a career break to raise a family Through grants to local authorities, we
are financing schemes to introduce more flexible working practices - such as
job-sharing.

e We will undertake reform of the teacher training system to make

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 28 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

it more effective in developing classroom skills.
¢ We will develop measures to encourage women with family
responsibilities to enter or return to teaching.

a
a AFTER 16

We believe that young people should be free to choose between college,
work-based training and sixth form studies. We are giving further education
colleges and sixth form colleges in England and Wales autonomy, free from
council control. We also value our school sixth forms, and will ensure they
retain their place in the new system. And we will allow them to attract older
students as well. FE colleges will continue to receive support for adult
education, while local authorities will retain the resources to respond to local
demand for leisure courses.

We will defend the well-respected A-level examinations, which Labour
would destroy We will continue to encourage participation m AS
examinations. We will also continue to develop new high-quality National
Vocational Qualifications, and introduce a new post-16 diploma which
recognises achievement in both vocational and academic courses.

e We will develop an Advanced Diploma which can be earned by
students pursuing either academic or vocational courses, and a new
General National Vocational Qualification.

e We intend to allow school sixth forms to open their doors if they wish
to older students, and to accept training credits or fees from them.

¢ From April next year, further education and sixth form colleges will
be independent of local government control.

e Mature students will enjoy a wider choice of courses.

?
HIGHER EDUCATION

Britain maintains the best university system in Europe. We have also
developed a thriving network of polytechnics, whose student numbers have
increased nearly sixfold since the end of the 1960s.

By the year 2000, one in three young people will follow full-time higher
education courses. Meanwhile, the number of mature entrants to higher
education has risen by 65 per cent since 1979. And our universities are
attracting increasing numbers of foreign students.

Despite this huge expansion, our students enjoy one of the most generous
support systems in the world. The introduction of student loans has given
students 30 per cent more money for their living costs than the former
system of grants alone. The new system will steadily reduce the proportion
of students' living costs that their parents are expected to meet.

¢ We will continue to expand the number of students in higher
education. We are abolishing the artificial 'binary line' between

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 29 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

universities and polytechnics.

e We are putting in place new mechanisms to ensure that academic
standards are maintained in higher education.

e We will continue to provide generous support for students and to
expand our student loans commitment.

?
THE TRAINING REVOLUTION

A training revolution is under way in Britain. The Government's job is to
create a framework within which men and women of all ages can develop
skills, gain qualifications and shape their own futures.

We have already brought the world of work and the world of school into
closer harmony Government and industry are working together. Employers
already spend over £20,000 million a year on training. Government spending
on training has increased 24 times in real terms since 1979, to £2,800
million. The Government's effort is being channelled through the 82 new
Training and Enterprise Councils (and the Local Enterprise Companies in
Scotland) - the most significant peace time partnership between government
and industry this century.

¢ 'Compacts' have resulted in many young people working to goals for
attainment and attendance in school. In return, they are guaranteed a
job with training - or training leading to a job.

e This year, two million students will participate in the Technical and
Vocational Education Initiative.

¢ Investors in People is the new national standard for companies making
a commitment to training. TECs play an important role in helping
companies attain it.

e Employer-led TECs and LECs are delivering Government-funded
training programmes which reflect industry's understanding of local
needs.

e Industry is working closely with the National Council for Vocational
Qualifications.

¢ The CBI's training targets for Britain's workforce demonstrate a new
partnership between business and education.

75 per cent of 16 year-olds stay on in full-time education or Youth Training
schemes, up from 46 per cent in 1979. Since 1983, over 3 million young
people have taken up Youth Training places. And 82 per cent go into jobs or
further education when they complete YT.

Now we are offering young people aged 16 and 17 vouchers they can use to
buy approved courses of education or training, and which will put the power
of choice in their hands.

In 1988, we launched Employment Training, the largest programme of its
kind in Europe, which has since helped 1.2 million people. While local
programmes are the responsibility of the TECs, the Government guarantees
the offer of help to particular groups of unemployed.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 30 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Last year, we launched the new Employment Action programme, which will
help more than 61,000 people in a full year. This is a new addition to a range
of measures which include Jobclubs, the Job Interview Guarantee Scheme
and other tested methods of helping unemployed people back to work.

We are also supporting individual training effort. Since 1988, when we
launched Career Development Loans (interest-free for up to 15 months),
over 25,000 people have benefited. Last year's Budget gave tax relief on
training fees - a boost to the 250,000 people a year who finance their own
training. Now, with the TECs, we intend to introduce new financial help for
career and training guidance.

e By the end of the new Parliament, the new system of National
Vocational Qualifications should cover virtually every occupation
in the economy. The CBI's training targets envisage 80 per cent of
young people reaching NVQ level 2 by the end of the Parliament.

¢ We intend to make training credits available to all 16 year-olds
and 17 year-olds within the lifetime of the new Parliament. The
TECs will continue to be responsible for the YT programme for
this age group.

¢ We will continue to finance training programmes for the long-
term un-employed and those who face particular difficulties. We
will launch with the TECs a new initiative, giving people a
voucher with which they can buy a ‘skill check', providing
assessment and guidance on how to make the most of their
working lives.

A
a WORKERS AND UNIONS

Over the past 13 years, we have legislated to lift regulatory burdens from the
shoulders of those who create jobs in Britain. To industry's relief, we
shunned the job-destroying European Social Charter. And we reject Labour's
job-destroying notion of a national minimum wage.

We have also legislated five times to transform industrial relations, returning
power from militants to ordinary union members. As a result, the number of
days lost each year through strikes has fallen from an average 12.9 million in
the 1970s to less than a million last year - the lowest figure since records
began a century ago.

Labour would disrupt industrial peace by weakening the power of
management and the courts. They propose to take away the courts' most
important sanction - the power to take over a union's assets.

Sympathy strikes would be legalised by Labour, and employers would be
prevented from dismissing strikers who broke their contracts.

The workers' rights we believe in are those which enhance individuals' status

and opportunities. We believe people should be informed and consulted by
employers about issues which affect their work. No one should be allowed to

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 31 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

deduct trade union fees automatically from an employee's pave without
written authorisation. Individuals must be given greater rights to belong to
the union of their choice.

We also believe strongly that employers, employees and customers should
not have their lives and businesses disrupted by wildcat strikes. In the new
Parliament, we will legislate to enforce and enhance these rights.

¢ We will require employers to give everyone who works for them
for more than eight hours a week a clear 'written statement of
their terms and conditions of employment.

e We will make automatic deduction of union membership dues
without 'written authorisation unlawful.

¢ We will take measures to give individuals greater freedom in
choosing a union.

¢ We will legislate to require that all pre- strike ballots are postal
and subject to independent scrutiny, and that at least seven days'
notice of a strike is given after a ballot.

¢ People who use public services will have the right to restrain the
disruption of those services by unlawful industrial action.

a
a A SHARE IN THE FUTURE

We also believe that people at work should be helped to build security for
themselves and their families. Employees should be given every opportunity
to acquire a stake in the business for which they work. We have ruled that
executive share option schemes may grant options at a discount only if the
employer also runs an all-employee scheme.

Saving for a pension reduces reliance on the state. We welcome the
provision of occupational schemes covering over 11 million workers. There
are already important safeguards, which we have improved, for the rights of
members in such schemes. But we believe that a full review of the
arrangements is now needed. We also believe that new freedoms for scheme
members will strengthen accountability and benefit investors.

e We will establish a review of the framework of law and regulation
within which occupational schemes operate.

¢ We will give every member of an occupational scheme the right to
an annual statement of the value of their savings.

¢ In addition we will examine ways of giving those who retire with
lump sum payments more choice as to how their savings are
invested.

~~ WOMEN AND OPPORTUNITY
A higher proportion of women go out to work in Britain than in an other EC

country except Denmark. Many women choose to work part-time, and our
policies have encouraged the development of part-time work within a

framework which safeguards employees from exploitation.

Throughout Europe, the UK is recognised to have the most comprehensive
legislation to combat sex discrimination. We are also committed to breaking
down artificial barriers to women's advancement based on prejudice or lack
of imagination. As an employer, government must continue to set an
example.

The tax relief we have introduced on training fees is constructed to ensure
that non-tax payers - who include many married women - will be able to
benefit, too. Many Training and Enterprise Councils already have specific
plans to help women trainees. We will involve them further in helping
employers to help with childcare.

We believe mothers should be treated equally by government, whether they
work outside the home or not. We are fully committed to maintaining the
real value of child benefit. And we will act where a push by government is
needed to stimulate the provision of childcare.

All employers who meet childcare costs can set these off against their
liability for corporation tax. In addition, we have relieved employees from
paying income tax on the benefit of workplace nurseries.

After-school childcare is an area of particular importance to many working
mothers. We will introduce a new initiative to encourage the provision of
after-school facilities by schools, employers and voluntary groups across the
country.

¢ The Government will amend the law relating to the employment
rights of pregnant women to give effect to the EC Directive on
Pregnant Workers. This addition to our already extensive legal
provision will give a right to at least 14 weeks' maternity leave and
protection against dismissal on grounds of pregnancy.

¢ We will take forward our public appointments initiative.
Departments will publish plans for between a quarter and a half
of public appointments to be held by women by 1996.

¢ We will ensure that all parts of government adopt a strategic
approach to the employment and development of women staff. We
will encourage them to participate in the Opportunity 2000
initiative.

¢ We will continue to oppose EC measures which would discourage
part-time employment, valued by so many women.

e We will encourage all TECs to adopt plans to help women trainees
have equal access to training opportunities.

e We will introduce a new grant, paid through TECs, to help
employers, voluntary groups or schools to set up after-school care
and holiday arrangements. We will ensure that schools are free to
participate.

FREEDOM UNDER THE LAW

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 33 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

The Conservative Party has always stood for the protection of the citizen and
the defence of the rule of law. Society is entitled to a sense of security;
individuals to peace of mind; the guardians of that peace to our whole-
hearted support. Our policies on law and order, and the rights of individuals,
are designed to protect the people of this country and their way of life.

Britain experiences less violent crime than many comparable countries. But
crime has continued to rise in Britain. And the challenge for the 1990s is to
step up the fight against lawlessness and violence, so that our citizens can
live free from fear.

We must continue to ensure that the sentence fits the crime - with long
sentences for dangerous criminals, and fines and a tougher regime for
punishment outside prison available as an alternative for less serious crime.
And we must maintain confidence in our legal system.

We must tackle crime at its roots. Two-thirds of the offences dealt with by
our courts are committed by only seven per cent of those convicted. Most of
these constant offenders started down the path of crime while still of school
age.

We have launched a reform of our prisons, improving the prospect that those
who serve custodial sentences will not return to crime.

But above all we must remember that it is our policemen and women who
are in the front line of the battle. To combat crime effectively the police need
the full support of the Government and the public.

POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY

We Conservatives can be proud of our record in supporting the police. Since
1979 we have increased spending on the police by 74 per cent in real terms.
Uniformed manpower has increased by 16,000 and civilian manpower by

12,000. We have launched a campaign to recruit 10,000 Special Constables.

Over the next few years we want to see a major reform which will help
provide what the public wants and needs: a visible, local police presence.

We will be encouraging police forces to develop local Community Policing,
to link the police more closely with the communities they protect. The
Metropolitan Police will be reorganised on this basis by the spring of 1993.
Two-thirds of English and Welsh forces are already preparing similar plans.
Pilot schemes suggest they can add greatly to the citizen's sense of security
and build support for the police.

Community Policing will involve local residents, listen to their views and
engage their help in the fight against crime. It will mean:

¢ smaller police units with officers serving the same area for longer.
That way, people can really get to know their local police officers;

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 34 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

¢ each police force devolving its management and operational control to
local units, and streamlining its chain of command;

* getting police back on the beat, and in close contact with the
neighbourhoods under their care.

It will be supported by an extension of Neighbourhood Watch schemes,
which are vital in deterring theft and burglaries.

Public confidence in the police is enhanced when people know what they
can expect from their local police force, and when outsiders are let into the
process of inspecting how they work. At least five police forces are already
leading the way with charters setting out their targets.

e We are continuing to increase police numbers. There will be 1,000
extra police officers this year.

e We will continue to give the police the support and resources they
need to carry out their duties effectively and efficiently.

e We will be seeking the nation-wide introduction of Community
Policing.

e We will encourage civilianisation as a means of freeing police
officers for operational duties.

e We will encourage the extension of Neighbourhood Watch to more
residential areas.

e We will continue to increase the Special Constabulary, which has
seen a rise in recruitment this year of 10 per cent.

e We want each police force to produce a charter telling local
people, for example, how quickly the police will aim to respond to
emergency calls.

¢ We will introduce lay inspectors with management experience into
the police inspectorate.

?
PROTECTORS AND VICTIMS

We look to the police to protect us. They risk their lives to do so. Police
officers are entitled to the protection of the community they serve. Those
who indulge in the shameful practice of 'ambushing', or seeking to frustrate
the work of the emergency services, deserve to face severe penalties. We
welcome the findings of a study by the Home Office and Crown Prosecution
Service which shows that assaults on policemen attract consistently heavier
penalties. But we will examine ways of introducing further protection for the
police.

We must also pay special attention to the needs of the victims of crime, in
the courts and in rebuilding their lives. We have increased funding for
Victim Support.

The number of people directly affected by violent and sexual crime remains
relatively small. But fear of crime can have a devastating effect on people's
lives, and particularly on women's lives. We are determined to reduce this
fear.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 35 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

e We will set up a working party to examine what more can be done to
protect the police and members of other emergency services from
assault.

e We will encourage victims to report sexual offences by giving them
statutory anonymity

¢ Under our Safer Cities programme, there are 124 schemes to improve
street lighting, which has been shown to reduce the fear of crime
significantly.

¢ Women-only taxi services are being encouraged under the same Safer
Cities programme.

PENALTIES AND PREVENTION

Our armoury of criminal law and penalties requires constant review. We
have just introduced a new law specifically aimed at the so-called 'joy-rider'.
This places the responsibility for dangerous driving, damage, injury or death
following from the taking of a vehicle squarely on the shoulders of those in
It.

Even where 'joy-riding' is not involved, causing death through dangerous or
drink driving is a very serious offence. We believe that the maximum
sentence for such a crime should reflect its gravity.

Squatting is nothing less than the seizure of another's property without
consent. Having consulted widely on the subject, we have decided to extend
the criminal law dealing with squatting.

Illegal camping by gypsies or other travellers can affect the lives of whole
communities. We believe that this problem must be tackled.

We are concerned about the small but persistent minority, particularly of
young people, who re-offend while already on bail. We have announced new
measures to deter them from repeated crime.

Young people who find themselves on probation for shop-lifting, vandalism
or petty thuggery should be shown where the path of crime may lead. They
should be given a brief personal experience of the nature of prison life.

e 'Joy-riders' will now face prison sentences of up to 5 years, unlimited
fines and unlimited driving bans.

e We will extend the maximum sentence for causing death through
dangerous or drink driving.

e We will create a new criminal offence of squatting, to give greater
protection to the owners and occupants of shops, commercial
premises, houses and flats.

e The 1968 Caravan Sites Act will be reviewed with the aim of reducing
the nuisance of illegal encampments.

¢ As part of a community sentence, young offenders will be taken to see
what life is really like inside one of our prisons - a sobering
experience for them.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 36 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

e We will introduce a new police power to make an arrest for breach of
police bail.

e We will give the courts the statutory power to increase sentences for
those who offend while on bail.

e We will increase the number of bail hostel places, to enable closer
supervision of those on bail.

e We will mount a drive against school truancy, and set up a Task Force
to find the best ways of co-ordinating the work of local agencies
helping young people at risk of becoming offenders.

i
a REFORMING OUR PRISONS

Prisons should be places which are austere but decent, providing a busy and
positive regime which prepares prisoners for their ultimate release.

We have been reversing the Labour Party's neglect of the prison service in
the 1970s. Since 1985, 14 new prisons have been opened 7 more will open
over the next two years. The end of overcrowding is now in sight.

We have already taken steps to implement the key recommendations of the
Woolf report on the future of our prisons. We will bring private sector skills
in to enhance efficiency and increase value for money

We have put out to tender the contract for prison escort services, an approach
which has worked well in other countries. The first contract for a privately
managed remand centre has been awarded.

¢ We will sustain our massive prison reform and building
programme.

¢ Areconstruction programme will end the degrading need for
'slopping out' by the end of 1994.

e We will reorganise prisoners' education, training and work
opportunities.

e We will establish the Prison Service as a separate agency, whose
director will have the clear responsibility for day-to day
operations. The Home Secretary will remain ministerially
accountable to Parliament for prison policy.

e We will increase the use of private sector management skills.

A
a OUR LEGAL SYSTEM

As a free society we must have a justice system that is fair, accessible and
responsive to the citizen.

We have introduced new powers for the Court of Appeal to increase
sentences for crime. And in response to public concern about a small but
significant number of miscarriages of justice, we have appointed a Royal
Commission to review aspects of the criminal justice system, including the
conduct of investigations, the handling of forensic evidence, and the powers

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 37 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

of the Court of Appeal.

We have already reduced the opportunity for abuse by our introduction of
tape-recorded interviews of suspects by the police. At the same time, we are
concerned that police investigations should not be made more difficult by the
misuse of certain rights.

We have already introduced a wide range of reforms following our Civil
Justice Review. Extending the jurisdiction of the County Courts has helped
speed up justice. The success of the small claims system in these courts has
shown that simplified procedures can enable people to conduct their own
cases or rely on a lay adviser. We have also introduced a reform which will
give people more choice as to who represents them legally in court.

We are committed to enabling people with limited means to have access to
legal services. We are determined to ensure that these services are delivered
efficiently, in a way which provides the best value for money.

The principles of the Citizen's Charter are being applied to our legal system.
We will shortly be publishing a Courts Charter.

We are overhauling the way in which family matters are handled in our
courts. The new family code will be applied by magistrates and judges
especially trained in family law.

Our Sunday Trading laws have come into question as a result of a possible
conflict with Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome. This matter is now before the
European Court of Justice, and we are awaiting a judgement. The
Government brought forward proposals in 1986 to reform the shopping laws,
but Parliament was not able to agree a conclusion. Parliament will be given
the opportunity to consider this issue again.

e We will introduce a major Criminal Justice Bill in the lifetime of
the new Parliament.

e We will extend the types of cases which can be handled by the
County Courts in a simplified way.

e We will consult on a Lay Adjudicators scheme to make it easier
for citizens to settle disputes with service providers.

e We will provide a code of family law that will continue to
underpin the institution of marriage, give priority to the welfare
of the child, and emphasise the primary responsibility of parents
for the welfare of children and the family.

¢ We will bring forward proposals for reform of the Sunday
Trading laws once the legal position has been made clear by the
European Court of Justice.

PORNOGRAPHY, PRIVACY, LIBEL

We have the toughest anti-pornography laws in Western Europe, and we will
keep them that way.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 38 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Every year, about 300,000 people - mostly women - request advice and
assistance in dealing with obscene or malicious phone calls. We intend to do
more to deter this harassment, in conjunction with the telecommunications
industry.

The Press Complaints Commission is now in operation, and we will monitor
its work carefully to see if self-regulation succeeds.

The public's dislike of unprincipled press behaviour has sometimes been
expressed in the award of erratically large libel damages. While this is
understandable, it has led to an inordinate number of successful appeals. We
therefore propose to simplify the law relating to libel in the light of the
recommendations of the Neill Committee.

e British domestic controls on pornography will remain in place
even after the completion of the Single European Market.

e We will increase the maximum penalties for making obscene or
malicious phone calls.

e We propose to allow judges to settle the level of damages in libel
cases where the defendant offers to pay to make amends.

i
a COMMUNITY RELATIONS

Racial harmony demands restraint on all sides, and a tolerant understanding
of the legitimate views of others.

Everybody, regardless of ethnic background, religious or personal belief, has
the right to go about his or her life free from the threat of intimidation and
assault. We are determined that everyone lawfully settled in this country
should enjoy the full range of opportunities in our society That requires
openness on the part of the majority and, on the part of the ethnic minorities
themselves, a determination to participate fully in the life of the wider
community.

The Home Office invests £129 million in grants designed to encourage those
running public services to ensure that people from ethnic minorities can
enjoy the full range of public services - such as health, housing and social
services. We believe that these grants would be more effective if
responsibility was transferred to those Departments which can make best use
of the money.

¢ Racial and sexual discrimination have no place in our society. We
have given the police stronger powers to deal with racial hatred.
We will continue to ensure that the full force of the law is used to
deal with racial attacks.

¢ We will transfer the education share of the Home Office's 'Section
11' money to the Department of Education, to focus help on those
from ethnic minority backgrounds who need additional English
language teaching.

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEES

Good community relations in this country depend upon a clear structure of
immigration controls which are fair, understandable and properly enforced.
We are determined to maintain our present system of immigration controls
unless we have evidence that other arrangements would be equally
satisfactory and cost-effective.

But an increasing number of would-be immigrants from Eastern Europe and
other parts of the world seek to abuse our openness to genuine refugees. The
number of people seeking refugee status has risen from 5,000 a year to

45 000 over the past four years.

We will continue to honour our commitment to the 1951 UN Convention,
and give refuge to those who reach our shores with a well-founded fear of
persecution.

¢ In the new Parliament we must therefore reintroduce the Asylum
Bill, opposed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, to create a
faster and more effective system of determining who are genuine
political refugees, and who are not.

¢ We will provide a fair and expeditious system for examining
claims for refugee status. This will include a workable appeal
system for applicants under which those with manifestly
unfounded claims will be returned quickly to their own country or
to the country they came from.

¢ Finger-printing will be introduced for asylum applicants, to
prevent multiple applications and fraudulent benefit claims.

A
a THE DANGER OF DRUGS

Illegal drug abuse poses a major threat to the fabric of our society. It can
destroy the health and lives of young people in particular. We will tackle this
problem with vigour.

We have already taken action on a wide front:

¢ we have set up co-ordinators in every local education authority to train
teachers about the harm drugs can do, and to bring the fight against
drug abuse into the classroom;

¢ we have set up 16 local drug prevention teams in inner cities to tackle
particular problem areas;

¢ we have created the National Drugs Intelligence Unit at New Scotland
Yard;

¢ we have taken the lead in Europe in pressing for the establishment of a
Europe-wide Drugs Unit, as a first step towards a creation of a

¢ we have set up a network of 31 drug liaison officers, in 19 different
countries, tracking the international drugs traffickers who threaten
Britain with their trade.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 40 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We now have the toughest sanctions in Western Europe against drug
traffickers.

A number of public services and voluntary bodies are engaged in fighting
drug misuse at local level. Such efforts need co-ordination to ensure that
local effort and dedication is directed to best effect.

e We will not legalise any banned drugs.

¢ We will bring forward proposals to ensure that the control of drug
misuse is co-ordinated effectively.

e We intend to strengthen our confiscatory powers still further. And
we will ensure that our controls against drug-trafficking are not
weakened by any changes in Europe.

e We will make it an offence to supply anabolic steroids to minors.

i
a THE THREAT OF TERRORISM

Tragic and dangerous events remind us only too frequently of the need for
the special measures provided by the Prevention of Terrorism Act. While
Labour proposes to weaken or dismantle them, we know that for the safety
of our citizens they must be continued, and the police effort against terrorism
must be reinforced.

We have set up in New Scotland Yard arrangements to co-ordinate the
activities of all our police forces in the fight against terrorism.

¢ We will provide the necessary measures and resources to combat
terrorism, whether it comes from the IRA or other evil groups
who seek to undermine our democracy.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR OTHERS

Conservatives believe we have responsibility one for another. We will
continue to care for those in need and work to establish a society that is
generous, as well as prosperous. Our health, care and social security systems
are fundamental to government responsibilities; and we believe strongly in
fostering voluntary services too.

THE NHS - PRESENT AND FUTURE

The Conservative Party is totally committed to the National Health Service.
The Government has set out in the Patient's Charter the principles on which
the NHS is based. The most fundamental of these is that need, and not
ability to pay, is and will remain the basis on which care is offered to all by
the NHS. Since 1979, there have been great improvements in the health of
the nation.

e Life expectancy has increased by two years.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 41 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

¢ Deaths amongst babies and very young children have gone down by
40 per cent.

¢ hospitals are treating well over a million more people a year as in-
patients.

¢ hospitals are treating over two million more people a year as out-
patients.

¢ kidney transplants have more than doubled.

¢ hip replacements have increased by over 50 per cent.

* coronary artery by-passes have nearly tripled.

Since 1979 the Government has vastly increased the resources available to
the NHS.

e We have increased overall funding for the NHS by 55 per cent after
allowing for inflation. The cash increases in each of the three years up
to 1992-93 have been the biggest ever.

e The number of doctors and dentists has been increased by 17,000, and
the real resources committed to GP services have doubled since 1979.

e The number of nurses and midwives has gone up by 69,000.

e We have established the independent Pay Review Body which nurses
had sought for so long, and increased their pay by 43 per cent. It is
hard now to remember that Labour actually cut nurses' pay.

e We have restored the hospital building programme so savagely cut by
Labour at the end of their last term of office.

But the Conservative Government has not simply spent more money on the
NHS.

e We have reformed the organisation of the NHS to encourage those
working in the service to respond to what patients want and need, and
to get the most out of the increased money which the taxpayer
provides.

At local level, health authorities now have the task of buying health care
with their local share of the National Health budget. Hospitals can now be
run by their own local team of doctors, nurses and managers. By April there
will be 156 NHS Trusts whose local boards will have extra freedoms to
develop local NHS services. Another 156 hospitals have applied to become
trusts from April 1993.

We have acted to reduce the long hours worked by junior doctors in
hospitals. For the first time limits are being set on the number of hours which
may be worked continuously.

Good nursing is the essential complement to good medicine. We have
introduced Project 2000 - a new approach to the professional training of
nurses.

The GP has a crucial role to play in the development of health services.

Under the Government's fund- holding initiative, doctors have control over
their own spending on behalf of patients for the first time. Over 3,000 GPs

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 42 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

will be fundholders by April, caring for 14 per cent of NHS patients. A
further 2,500 are preparing to become fundholders in April 1993. As a result,
new services are being offered at local surgeries and health centres. Many
general practitioners have said that they would like to become involved in
fund-holding. We have already extended the scope of the fund-holding
scheme to allow general practitioners to provide services such as community
nursing.

¢ We will, year by year, increase the level of real resources
committed to the NHS. Savings made through greater efficiency
will be ploughed back into the Service.

¢ We will develop a comprehensive research and development
strategy for the NHS.

¢ We will continue to develop the NHS Trust movement which
places responsibility for managing hospitals and other services
with local teams who are closest to patients.

e We will continue to encourage the involvement of doctors and
other medical staff in the management of services.

e We will introduce powers for nurses to prescribe where
appropriate.

e We will complete the implementation of Project 2000 training for
nurses.

¢ We will set goals for the employment of women in professional
and managerial posts in the NHS.

e We will ensure that, following maternity leave or a career break,
all women working in the NHS, including those returning to
nursing on a part-time or job-sharing basis, are able to return to
work of a similar status or level to that which they left.

e We will ensure that the benefits of fund- holding arrangements are
available to any GP who wishes to apply, and we will be ready to
extend the scope of the scheme further as it develops.

i
a THE PATIENT'S CHARTER

No one questions the dedication of those who work in the NHS But before
the Government's reforms, the system did not always allow that dedication
to produce the service which people should be able to expect.

The Patient's Charter sets out clearly what is now expected from the NHS.
We have already pledged that in future no one will wait more than two years
for treatment on the NHS. In many parts of the country for most treatments,
the waiting time is much shorter than this; and we will seek further progress
in reducing waiting times.

¢ Binding guarantees will be set locally for in-patient waiting times,
starting with the operations where waiting causes most distress. To
ensure that progress on waiting times continues, we intend that
from 31 March 1993, no one should have to wait more than 18
months for a hip or knee replacement, or a cataract operation. We
are sure that, as now, many hospitals will be able to do better than

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 43 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

this.

¢ We will move to a system under which a named nurse or midwife
will be responsible for your care while you are in hospital.

e We will set specific targets for out patient waiting times.

¢ We will make it easier for patients to find out what services are
available from the NHS via a new national NHS information
service.

e We will ensure that comparative information about the health
standards achieved by health authorities is available to the public.

e Simple systems will be set up to allow complaints to be registered
and responses given if things go wrong.

A
a STRATEGY FOR HEALTH

This Government has embarked on the first ever strategy for health. Good
health requires more than good NHS care when people are sick. A variety of
factors - including preventive medicine, diet, exercise, sensible drinking and
not smoking - can contribute substantially to improving health across the
whole population.

¢ We will set health objectives to be achieved by the end of the
century, including reductions in illness and death from heart
disease and cancers.

e We will add new health objectives as the strategy develops.

?
CARE SERVICES

Care services for children, the elderly and the handicapped are provided by
local government, health authorities, the private sector and voluntary groups,
not directly by central government. But government is indirectly involved as
the provider of taxpayers money and through its duty to set standards for
publicly and privately provided care.

As the number of elderly people in the population grows, there will be more
frail and vulnerable citizens who need support. Many of them will want to
be cared for at home. Others will need residential or nursing home care. It is
vital that people should have choice in the type of care available. In all cases
people must be able to rely on the quality of care. As we move towards
implementation of 'Caring for People' in April 1993:

¢ We will take steps to ensure that individuals who need residential
or nursing care continue to have a choice of homes, including
independent homes. Money transferred from the Social Security
budget to local social services departments will be used for this
purpose.

e We will ensure that all local authorities publish information about
the social services that are available, including information on
standards and complaints procedures.

e We will provide choice in domiciliary and day care.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 44 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

¢ We will provide further funding for voluntary organisations to
play their vital part in the development of community care
services.

e We will support the organisations which help those who care for
friends and relatives at home.

i
a CHILDREN

This Government introduced the Children Act, a landmark in legislation to
protect children. The Act requires childcare facilities to be registered to
ensure that standards are maintained throughout the country

We believe that the diversity of childcare provision in the UK is one of its
strengths. It offers parents real choice. Over 90 per cent of 3-4 year-olds are
engaged in some form of group activity We shall continue to encourage the
development of childcare arrangements in the voluntary and independent
sectors.

¢ Each local authority will be asked to produce a Local Childcare
Plan setting out the provision available in their area.

e We will ensure that the standards implemented through the
Children Act are applied sensibly, and do not discourage private
or voluntary arrangements which are often best suited to the
needs of children and parents.

¢ We will carry forward a family support initiative, encouraging the
voluntary sector to work in partnership with families and local
authorities.

i
a SOCIAL SECURITY

Our aim is to improve further and modernise Britain's social security system.
We are providing more support than ever before £14 for every £10 spent in
1979, after allowing for inflation. More importantly, this extra help is more
clearly focused on those groups with the greatest needs - less well-off
pensioners, disabled people and low income families.

We have also sought to provide those on social security with better
incentives to earn, and gain independence. All too often the old system
created barriers to work and penalised the thrifty.

The benefit structure is now more flexible and easier to understand. The new
Benefits Agency is simplifying forms and widening choice in methods of
payment. We will complete the massive investment in new technology -
Europe's biggest computerisation project - that has made it possible to raise
the quality of service to the public. And we will extend 'Helplines' and other
means of assistance with individual difficulties.

e We will continue to simplify social security forms wherever
possible.

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

e We will set up a new Family Credit telephone advice service to
support working families.

e We will establish a new agency to carry out all social security war
pensions work with the aim of providing a better, more efficient
service to war pensioners and war widows.

a
a SECURITY IN RETIREMENT

Britain's pensioners recognise the security that Conservative government
brings - low inflation, savings that grow, firmness in the face of crime, public
services that put the customer first. Those who have dedicated their lives to
the service of the community deserve that stability

We will continue to give the fight against inflation our first priority The basic
state retirement pension will remain the foundation for retirement. We will
continue to protect its value against price rises, as we have for the last 13
years.

We also recognise that some pensioners, who have no savings or pensions
from their jobs, need extra help. So we will increase the additional support,
already up by over £300 million a year since 1989, available to less well-off
pensioners.

The number of those over pensionable age will be far higher in the next
century than it is today If we do not make provision now; the burden we will
place on our children will be too great. That is why we must encourage
people to build up savings, investments, and occupational and personal
pensions.

But Labour policy is hostile to such personal effort; Labour wants
pensioners to depend on the State. Failure to control inflation meant that
pensioners' incomes from savings were cut under the last Labour
Government.

About eight in ten pensioners have some sort of second income to top up
their state pension. By abolishing the hated earnings rule we have enabled
pensioners to keep their retirement pension, even if they take a job in
retirement. And we have increased the level of savings that is disregarded in
working out entitlement to benefits for pensioners. Personal pensions have
brought real choice into retirement provision. Over 4% million people have
set up their own pensions since 1988. We want to see both occupational and
personal provision expand much further in the course of the 1990s. (See
‘Opportunity for all - A share in the future' for our proposals on occupational
pensions.)

e As evidence of our continuing commitment to poorer pensioners,
we have announced in the Budget an increase of £2 a week for
single people, £3 a week for couples, in income support for
pensioners. Combined with the increases this April, this measure
will provide less well-off pensioners with between £5.73 and £10.70

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 46 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

a week extra.

¢ We will continue to pay, from April 1993, a rebate at the level
recommended by the Government Actuary for all those who
contract out of the State Earnings. Related Pension Scheme.

¢ We will legislate to provide a new 1 per cent incentive for holders
of personal pensions aged 30 and over from April 1993, when the
existing incentive ends.

e We will consider proposals for a new system of rebates to come
into effect from April 1996 with the aim of ensuring that personal
pensions remain attractive across the age range.

¢ We are firmly committed to equal treatment for men and women
in pensions. Following assessment of the responses to our
discussion paper, we will bring forward legislation to achieve this.

A
a SUPPORTING FAMILIES

Our reforms have cut away the barriers that meant many breadwinners lost
money if they went to work. Family Credit has transformed the prospects of
350,000 low-income families. As a result of improvements since 1988, we
have made available an extra £600 million a year in real terms to low-
income families with children.

But we also recognise that all families face extra costs in bringing up
children. So we have raised Child Benefit. For a two-child family the
increases we are making will, by April 1992, have raised the total value of
Child Benefit by almost £3 in a single year, to £17.45 a week.

Our new Child Support Agency will make sure that absent parents make a
proper contribution - and that far more lone parents and their children get the
maintenance that is theirs by right. And benefit changes make it easier for
more families - including single parents - to combine work and family
responsibilities.

¢ Child Benefit will remain the cornerstone of our policy for all
families with children. Its value will increase each year in line with
prices.

¢ Child Benefit will continue to be paid to all families, normally to
the mother, and in respect of all children.

i
a HELP FOR DISABLED PEOPLE

Under the Conservatives, more disabled people than ever before are getting
the help they need and deserve. Since 1979, the number receiving
Attendance Allowance has more than trebled; the number receiving Mobility
Allowance has risen six fold; the number receiving Invalid Care Allowance
has risen 25-fold. Today we spend some £12,000 million a year on benefits
for long-term sick and disabled people. Even after allowing for inflation, that
is 2% times as much as Labour spent in the 1970s.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 47 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

¢ Disability Living Allowance will bring together the existing
Attendance and Mobility Allowance, providing new help to many
disabled people who at present get no such help. Disability Working
Allowance will make it easier for disabled people to take up a job.

e We are introducing new disability benefits which will, in the next
Parliament, bring extra help to at least 300,000 people. By 1993-94
these and other improvements will mean that we will be directing
an extra £300 million a year to long-term sick and disabled people.

¢ The Independent Living Fund has proved a great success in giving
severely disabled people an opportunity to live in the community.
We are committed to maintaining a fluid which supports the most
severely disabled people.

?
THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR

Charities and voluntary groups play a vital role in our national life. Britain is
rich in its citizens' willingness to give time, effort and money to helping
others. We have a great tradition of voluntary work at home and overseas.
There are now about 350,000 voluntary groups in Britain - and personal
donations to charities now amount to some £5,000 million a year.

We have done much to boost charitable giving.

¢ Under the Payroll Giving Scheme, employees can now contribute up
to £50 a month tax-free.

¢ Gifts and bequests have been exempted from Inheritance Tax.

¢ The Gift Aid scheme allows charities to claim tax relief on one-off
gifts of more than £400 - a change just announced in the Budget.

e The maximum limit on single charitable gifts qualifying for Income
and Corporation Tax relief has been abolished.

The new Charities legislation will ensure that charities are better managed
and properly regulated. We believe this will enhance public confidence in
charities and further boost charitable giving.

The Government gives some £2,500 million a year to support the activities
of the voluntary sector (including housing associations). Industry has been
generous with its sponsorship and with technical support. But money is not
the only contribution that government and business can make. Businesses
have become much more practically involved in work in the community And
government could do more to encourage new forms of volunteering, to
encourage the most effective use of the money it gives, and to bring together
voluntary effort at the local and national level.

e We will continue to support the work of the voluntary sector and
promote volunteering.

e We will work with voluntary agencies to develop, over the life of
the next Parliament, a national bank of information on
opportunities for volunteering.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 48 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

e We will encourage efforts to improve the co-ordination and
promote the growth of local volunteer support, building on the
success of Neighbourhood Watch to develop a network of
voluntary help in local communities.

i
a ANIMAL WELFARE

We are leading the European Community in our achievements in improving
animal welfare. We have also taken action at home and abroad to improve
conservation, and will continue to do so.

English Nature, which advises the Government on wildlife issues, has
embarked on an ambitious programme to restore endangered species. The
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 provides special protection for 304
species of birds and animals, as well as protecting our heritage of wild
plants.

We are firmly opposed to international trade in rare and protected species
such as rhinoceroses, cheetahs, leopards, and bears. We have pushed
successfully for an EC ban on large-scale drift nets that threatened dolphins,
and we support the UN resolution calling for a moratorium on their use. We
support the extension of the moratorium on commercial whaling and have
co-sponsored resolutions against 'scientific' hunting of whales. We have
successfully pressed for an EC ban on the importation of baby seal products
and of furs from those countries which permit leghold traps.

We have set up the Farm Animal Welfare Council and have brought in
welfare codes covering livestock on farms and in transit. We are establishing
an ethical committee to look at the effects of advanced techniques in animal
breeding. We have banned the use of veal crates, and taken action to ensure
humane slaughter. We insisted that we should retain our power to stop the
export of live horses. At Maastricht we secured a landmark in animal
welfare: our partners' agreement to a declaration that the welfare of animals
should be taken into account in the framing of EC legislation.

We now have the toughest set of controls on animal experimentation in
Europe, and the number of animals used in experiments has fallen steadily
We have supported stronger laws to protect badgers and stop cruel tethering,
and have increased the penalties for organising animal fights and for cruelty.

¢ We will introduce a Wildlife Enhancement Scheme and expand
the Species Recovery Scheme, both to be run by English Nature.

¢ We have tightened controls on the import of wild birds and will
press the EC to do the same.

e We oppose resumption of the trade in ivory or elephant products,
and will provide additional support for elephant conservation
projects in Africa.

e We will urge our EC partners to bring animal welfare standards
up to UK levels, for example by banning veal crates and stalls and
tethers for pigs. We will press them to put into practice the

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

principles of the Maastricht declaration.

e We will use our EC Presidency to toughen up EC regulations and
improve EC compliance with rules governing animal experiments.

e We will press for higher EC standards for the keeping of battery
hens and for the care of animals in transit.

e We will not accept any weakening of our rabies prevention
safeguards.

A BRIGHTER BRITAIN

Making Britain a brighter and better place in which to live requires a high
quality physical environment - including housing, transport and
reinvigorated urban areas. The Conservative commitment is both to the re-
creation of our civic pride and also to the preservation and integrity of our
tural heritage, founded on the core industry of agriculture. Our aim is to
enhance the quality of life for the British people.

A
a HOME OWNERSHIP

The opportunity to own a home and pass it on is one of the most important
rights an individual has in a free society Conservatives have extended that
right. It lies at the heart of our philosophy We want to see wealth and
security being passed down from generation to generation. Some 4 million
more householders own their own homes compared with 1979. The number
of former council tenants who have bought their homes has risen to 1.4
million.

We now need to make it easier for those council tenants living in high-cost
areas or on low incomes to move gradually into home ownership, without
taking on too heavy a financial burden at any one time. This will bring the
benefits of home ownership within the reach of more people and introduce
more diversity in local authority estates. We also want to help more
leaseholders to own and control the management of their property.

But we recognise that not everyone can, or will want to, buy his or her
home. So we are determined to encourage a strong private rented sector
while continuing to safeguard the rights of existing regulated tenants.
Bringing empty private sector dwellings back into use will extend choice,
make it easier for people to move jobs, and help tackle homelessness.

¢ We will maintain mortgage tax relief.

¢ We will continue 'Right to Buy' discounts, and ensure that local
authorities respond reasonably and rapidly to applications.

¢ We will introduce a new nation-wide 'Rents to Mortgages' scheme,
enabling council tenants to take a part-share in their home,
gradually stepping up to full ownership.

¢ We will put more of the Housing Corporation's £2,000 million
budget into Do-It-Yourself shared ownership. This will enable first

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 50 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

time buyers to choose a home and buy a share of it - usually 50 per
cent - with a housing association paying rent on the rest until they
wish to increase their stake in the property.

e We will introduce 'Commonhold' legislation, giving residential
leaseholders living in blocks of flats the right to acquire the
freehold of their block at the market rate. Leaseholders of higher
rated houses will also be given the right to buy the freehold of
their property. Leaseholders who live in a block which does not
qualify will have a new right to buy an extended lease.

e We will introduce statutory time limits for answers by local
authorities to standard inquiries by house-buyers, and explore the
idea of a new computerised Property Data Bank bringing together
information held by the Land Registry and other public bodies.

e We will extend nation-wide the scheme we have piloted to increase
private renting, whereby housing associations manage properties,
building trust between tenant and private sector landlord.

e As soon as possible in the new Parliament, we will introduce a flew
""Rent a Room' scheme wider which home-owners will be able to
let rooms to lodgers without haying to pay tax on the rent they
receive.

A
a MEETING HOUSING NEED

We are also committed to securing a better deal for council tenants and
increasing the supply of affordable housing for those in housing need. We
will introduce more choice, improve management of estates and create new
rights as part of the Tenant's Charter. Our aim will be to give tenants a
choice of landlord wherever possible, and make management of both council
and housing association stock more responsive to the needs of tenants.

We will improve the way in which council housing is managed by bringing
in new private sector providers operating on contract to the local authority
We will introduce more competition and choice, thereby improving services
to the tenant and increasing accountability. And we intend to give council
tenants new opportunities themselves to improve the flat or house in which
they live.

We have already begun a process of Large-Scale Voluntary Transfer which
allows local authority tenants to opt to transfer to a housing association. We
wish to see this result in diversity, not local monopoly, and will therefore act
to limit the size of blocks that can be transferred.

Nearly all new social housing is now being built by housing associations.
Over the next three years, we are committed to spend nearly £6,000 million
through the Housing Corporation to provide 153,000 homes.

We will do more to bring into use properties owned by central and local
government which are standing empty for no good reason. This will enable
us to house more people on the waiting list and, in some cases, to provide
more opportunities for homesteading.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 51 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

Through Estate Action and Housing Action Trusts we have invested £1,000
million in recent years in a concentrated attack on the country's worst
housing estates. Some 360,000 dwellings have been improved as a result. As
part of those programmes, on which we are committed to spend a further
£1,400 million over the next three years, we are demolishing or redesigning
tower blocks and deck access estates, rebuilding on a more human scale.
Wherever we can, whenever tenants want it, and where resources allow; we
will pull down the eyesores which have blotted our cityscapes and too often
provided breeding grounds for crime and delinquency.

The Government is spending about £100 million tackling the problem of
rough sleeping in our cities. As a result we have seen a sharp fall in the
numbers who sleep rough on our streets. Working closely with the voluntary
sector we will continue to provide help for those sleeping rough, particularly
in the capital.

We will revolutionise the management of council houses and flats.
Compulsory competitive tendering will oblige local authorities to
bring in managers who demonstrate their ability to deliver the
best services to tenants.

We will continue our programme of Large Scale Voluntary
Transfer of council properties to housing associations. But in
order to bring management closer to tenants, we intend to reduce

the limit on the number of properties transferred in a single batch.

We will give tenants a new Right to Improve, so they can receive
compensation for certain home improvements which they
undertake. And we will improve the existing Right to Repair. We
will continue our Estate Action and Housing Action Trust
programmes which concentrate resources on the worst council
estates.

We will enable tenants to apply for Housing Action Trusts to take
over and improve the worst estates.

We will work with the Housing Corporation to establish a new
Ombudsman for housing association tenants. We will also
encourage the Corporation to extend opportunities for tenant
involvement in the management of housing association properties.
We will set up a Task Force - headed by an independent chairman
- to help bring empty government residential properties back into
use. These will either be sold or let on short term leases to those in
housing need.

As part of Estate Action we will introduce a new pilot scheme to
promote homesteading. Local authorities will be encouraged to

offer those in housing need the opportunity to restore and improve

council properties. In exchange, homesteaders will pay a lower
rent or be able to buy at a reduced price.

?
TRANSPORT

Under the Conservatives, transport in Britain is being transformed. More
competition on the roads and in the air has led to better services and more

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 12:38

Page 52 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

choice. Our successful policies of deregulation and privatisation have gone
hand in hand with a sustained and growing programme of investment. Over
1,000 miles of new trunk roads and motorway have been built, more than
100 bypasses constructed, and some 750 miles of railway electrified.
Airlines now operate 50 per cent more flights. More people travel further
and more easily than ever before.

Over the next three years we are committed to the biggest investment in
Britain's transport infrastructure in our history

We will also seek further opportunities for the private sector to contribute, as
it has for example with the Channel Tunnel, the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge at
Dartford, the second Severn Bridge and the Birmingham Northern Ring
Road. We intend the proposed new rail link from the Channel Tunnel to
King's Cross to be taken forward by the private sector.

i
a THE RAILWAYS

We believe that the railways can play a bigger part in responding to Britain's
growing transport needs, and are investing accordingly Next year alone,
British Rail's external finance will top £2,000 million. The new Passenger's
Charter will help to raise the quality of service. For the first time ever
performance targets will be set, widely published and rigorously monitored;
fare levels will reflect the standards set; and discounts will be paid to regular
travellers where performance targets are not met.

We believe that the best way to produce profound and lasting improvements
on the railways is to end BR's state monopoly We want to restore the pride
and local commitment that died with nationalisation. We want to give the
private sector the opportunity to operate existing rail services and introduce
new ones, for both passengers and freight.

A significant number of companies have already said that they want to
introduce new railway services as soon as the monopoly is ended. We will
give them that chance.

Our plans for the railways are designed to bring better services for all
passengers as rapidly as possible. We believe that franchising provides the
best way of achieving that. Long term, as performance improves and
services become more commercially attractive as a result of bringing in
private sector disciplines, it will make sense to consider whether some
services can be sold outright.

In the next Parliament:

¢ By franchising, we will give the private sector the fullest
opportunity to operate existing passenger railway services.

¢ Required standards of punctuality, reliability and quality of
service will be specified by franchises; subsidy will continue to be
provided where necessary; arrangements to sustain the current

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 53 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

national network of services will be maintained; and through-
ticketing will be required.

« Anew Rail Regulator - who will ensure that all companies have
fair access to the track - will award the franchises and make sure
that the franchisees honour the terms of the contract.

¢ BR's accounting systems and internal structures will be
reorganised. One part of BR will continue to be responsible for all
track and infrastructure. The operating side of BR will continue
to provide passenger services until they are franchised out to the
private sector.

¢ The franchise areas will be decided only after technical
discussions with BR. But our aim will be to franchise out services
in such a way as to reflect regional and local identity and make
operating sense. We want to recover a sense of pride in our
railways and to recapture the spirit of the old regional companies.

¢ We will sell BR's freight operations outright. We will also sell its
parcels business.

¢ We will be prepared to sell stations - which we want to be centres
of activity - either to franchisees or independent companies.

¢ The Railway Inspectorate will be given full powers to ensure the
highest standards of safety.

A
a ROADS

Nine out of every ten journeys, whether passenger or freight, are made by
road. We must therefore continue to provide an efficient road network. In the
years ahead we will concentrate particularly on the bypass programme.

As part of the Citizen's Charter, we will bring forward reforms which will
enable the private sector to start filling the gaps in the motorway service area
network and to introduce more variety Rather than large, intrusive stations at
long intervals we should see smaller, more frequent service areas providing a
much wider range of facilities.

We will investigate ways of speeding up, within the Department of
Transport, the procedures for building new roads. We will continue our
campaign to keep 'coning off’ on motorways to a minimum by extending
lane rental schemes, under which contractors who fall behind schedule incur
financial penalties. Next year two-thirds of all motorway maintenance work
will be carried out in this way.

Britain has the best road safety record in the European Community In spite
of the vastly increased volume of traffic, fewer people are now killed on our
roads than at any time since 1948. Our aim is to improve on that record still
further.

In spite of the benefits they bring, cars carry an environmental cost. In
Britain catalytic converters will be compulsory on all new cars from the end
of 1992. This will eliminate virtually all harmful exhaust gases, except for
the emission of CO2. The only certain way of cutting CO2 emissions is to

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 54 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

encourage fuel efficiency. Action is needed at international level and we will
play our full part.

Buses have an increasingly important part to play The deregulation of long-
distance coach services has led to a major expansion in reliable and cheap
services. Bus deregulation outside London has increased mileage by 16 per
cent. We now propose to take deregulation and privatisation further.

We will improve road transport by:

¢ Investing £6,300 million in our trunk road and motorway network
over the next three years, concentrating particularly on bypasses.
Some 40 new ones will be opened by 1993 on trunk roads alone.

¢ Increasing penalties for those convicted of drink driving.

¢ Installing cameras at dangerous road junctions to film those who
drive through red traffic lights.

e Encouraging local councils, assisted by a special budget we have
set aside, to introduce pedestrian priority areas and cycle lanes.

¢ Privatising the remaining 39 local authority bus companies.

¢ Deregulating buses in London and privatising the London Buses
subsidiaries. A new London Bus Executive will be responsible for
bus- stops, stands and stations and for contracting out socially
necessary services. The concessionary fares scheme in London will
continue.

¢ Changing the system under which motorway service areas are
provided.

¢ Encouraging action internationally, and within our own motor
industry, to promote more fuel-efficient vehicles.

i
a AVIATION AND SHIPPING

More competition in aviation means more choice, better services and lower
fares. That is why we have been pressing within the EC for full liberalisation
of services. We also want to see more transatlantic flights, particularly to
regional airports. People in the regions should not have to travel to London
in order to fly to the United States. Direct flights would boost local
economies and apply downward pressure on fares. The key regional airports
are still in local authority ownership. They should be well placed to benefit
from an increase in the number of direct point-to-point flights. But if they
are really to grow and prosper, they need access to private capital, freed from
the constraints of public ownership.

Air safety cannot be compromised. Over the next five years the Civil
Aviation Authority will. invest £750 million in modernising its systems.

More can be done to cut some of the regulatory burdens our shipping
industry faces. We will ensure that the recommendations of the Government

Industry Joint Working Party are put into effect as rapidly as possible.

e We will further liberalise transatlantic air services and encourage

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 55 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

more international flights to and from regional airports.

e We will encourage local authorities to sell their airports.

e We will reduce airport congestion by increasing the capacity of
our air traffic control

¢ We will continue to campaign within the EC for further
liberalisation, particularly of cabotage, so that there are more
commercial opportunities for British companies.

?
LONDON'S TRANSPORT

A major programme of renewal and modernisation is transforming public
transport in London - including the biggest expansion of London's rail
network since the 1930s.

The £750 million upgrading of the Central Line is already under way, to be
followed by a similar programme on the Northern Line; the Jubilee Line
extension and Crossrail will follow.

London Underground is planning to invest £3,500 million over the next three
years. It has introduced an ambitious Company Plan which will lead to better
service, cleaner trains and more staff at stations and on platforms. Their new

Charter will be published shortly

Responsibility for the Docklands Light Railway has been transferred to the
London Docklands Development Corporation. As its performance continues
to improve, we expect to see growing private sector interest in purchasing it
outright.

¢ We will seek to privatise the Docklands Light Railway during the
lifetime of the next Parliament.

¢ The new Jubilee Line is being extended to Docklands and South
East London and will be followed by the East-West Crossrail,
linking Paddington to Liverpool Street. The Docklands Light
Railway is being extended at an eventual cost of £800 million.

¢ London Underground's Charter will set out tougher new
standards and what it will do to compensate passengers should it
fail to meet those standards.

A
a LOCAL GOVERNMENT

Local councillors - some 25,000 men and women throughout Britain - are
responsible for some of our most important public services. Since 1979 we
have sought to create an accountable local government system capable of
delivering high quality local services at a price that local people are prepared

to pay.

Conservatives councils in shires, districts and cities have been at the
forefront of these reforms. In a responsive and efficient manner, they have
demonstrated how to deliver good services at an affordable price.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 56 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Over the past 13 years, we have:

¢ held down unjustified rises in the cost of local government;

e abolished the power of local councils to shift the burden of taxation on
to local business, for the first time limiting the overall rise in business
rates to no more than the rate of inflation;

¢ abolished an expensive and bureaucratic layer of government in
London and other big cities;

¢ developed the local authority role from direct provider to effective
enabler, encouraging many tenants to buy their own homes, allowing
schools the freedom to manage their own affairs and improving the
quality of local services by allowing private business to compete for
contracts.

Labour threaten all these reforms. They would 'uncap' local spending,
leading to higher local and national taxes. They would 'uncap' business rates,
threatening a return to the 1980s when the English rate poundage rose 37 per
cent more than inflation. They would abolish the requirement on local
authorities to seek value for money through competitive tendering. They
would remove the freedom of local communities to preserve their grammar
schools. They would introduce a new; expensive layer of government
bureaucracy at regional level. They would return local government finance
to the bad old days of domestic rates, with unrestrained power for local
councils to charge householders as much as they like. And they would
abolish the Audit Commission, which not only maintains the probity of local
government accounting, but also pioneered the drive for better quality of
service and value for money in local government.

We now propose further reforms in the structure, finance and accountability
of local government. In the meantime, we have transferred a further share of
the burden of financing local services to central government. Today, local
community chargepayers bear only a small proportion of the cost of local
councils.

e We will set up a commission to examine, area by area, the
appropriate local government arrangements in England. Local
communities will be fully consulted and their loyalties and
interests will be central to the commission s task in deciding
whether in any area a single tier of local government could
provide better accountability and greater efficiency.

e We are looking at ways in which the internal management of local
authorities might become more effective.

e We are applying the principles of the Citizen's Charter to local
government, requiring the publication of more information which
will enable local people to judge the efficiency of their councils in
providing services.

¢ We will continue to 'cap' local spending where necessary.

e As we announced in the Budget, no one's Uniform Business Rate
will go up this year by more than the rate of inflation 4.1 per cent.
And we have speeded up the benefits of revaluation for those
businesses who gain from it.

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

e In future years, we will maintain our pledge to prevent UBR
poundage rising by more than inflation.

¢ We will replace the Community Charge with a new Council Tax in
April 1993. The Council Tax will be simple and straightforward to
administer. It will be fair and will rightly reflect both the value of
the property and the number of adults who live in it.

e Single householders, who suffered under the rates, will receive a
25 per cent discount. By grouping properties into a limited
number of bands, the Council Tax also avoids the punitive bills
which would be imposed by an unfettered rating system of the
kind proposed by Labour. Students and people on low incomes
will not have to pay.

i
a CITIES

We take pride in our cities. Right across Britain they have been given a new
lease of life. From London to Glasgow; from Cardiff to Newcastle, historic
buildings have been restored and areas which had been run down have been
transformed. The £4,000 million Action for Cities programme underlines the
Conservative commitment to our inner cities and the people who live there.
It highlights our determination to spread opportunity as widely as possible.
We want all our people to share in growing prosperity and to have a stake in
the country's future. Much has been achieved in recent years. The Urban
Development Corporations and the wide range of central government grants
have helped to regenerate many of our inner city areas. But more remains to
be done.

The best way to restore the spirit of enterprise which first made our cities
great is for local people, the private sector, the voluntary sector and local and
central government, to work together in partnership. That is the principle
which lies behind City Challenge. Its new approach of competitive bidding
has already galvanized towns and cities into bringing forward imaginative
proposals for regeneration. It has improved co-ordination, secured better
value for money and encouraged programmes which tackle problems on a
number of fronts.

e We will continue to extend City Challenge and allocate a greater
proportion of resources by competitive bidding.

e We will support Urban Development Corporations in their critical
task of urban regeneration.

¢ We will bring together resources targeted inner city programmes
into a single budget. This will mean that funding will go where it is
most needed locally rather than according to a set of priorities
determined in Whitehall.

¢ We will strengthen the machinery for co ordination in the regions.
New, integrated regional offices of the appropriate Whitehall
departments will be established so that business and local
government will have only one port of call.

¢ We will establish a new Urban Regeneration Agency to pull
together our efforts to clear up and develop derelict land, helping

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 58 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

to bring it back into commercial use and provide new
opportunities for local people.

Working in the urban areas, the URA will administer much of the Urban
programme of the Department of the Environment. It will have a dual
function. First, outside the existing UDC areas, it will reclaim derelict land,
assembling suitable sites for redevelopment using vesting or compulsory
purchase powers where necessary Second, it will itself be able to develop
land in partnership with the private sector. This represents a major step
forward in unlocking the commercial potential of our inner cities and of
breathing new life into areas which may have been derelict for many years.

But our focus is not just on physical regeneration. We want to see more
opportunities for training, more encouragement to enterprise, better
education and more measures to tackle drugs and crime.

Encouraging enterprise, improving the environment and providing new
opportunities for the unemployed are central to our inner city policies.
Remotivating individuals and providing the right conditions for business are
the only ways to make lasting change.

e We will offer the Loan Guarantee Scheme for small firms on more
generous terms in inner city areas. The scheme will be extended
from Task Force areas to include successful City Challenge
bidders.

e We will make more people eligible for our successful Job
Interview Guarantee Scheme, which links unemployed people
with local lobs.

e We will carry out pilot projects for the 'foyer' concept, whereby
young people are given a place in a hostel if in exchange they give
a commitment to train and look for work.

¢ We will pilot a number of 'back to work' bonus schemes in inner
city areas for the long-term unemployed.

¢ We will extend customised training under the Job Link
programme to include City Challenge areas.

e We will make inner city Task Force and City Challenge areas
eligible for regional innovation grants.

We are also determined to raise standards in our inner city schools, to crack
down on truancy, and to help prepare young people for the world of work.

The City Technology Colleges show what can be done. They are
overwhelmingly popular with parents and pupils and are doing much to raise
standards for children of all abilities in the inner cities.

Under the Citizen's Charter, we shall soon be able to identify much more
precisely than ever before those schools which are delivering unacceptably
low standards. So will parents. We will publish test results, exam results and
truancy rates and ensure that there is regular independent inspection. This
will enable us to put the spotlight on those inner city LEAs and schools
which are failing their pupils.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 59 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

e We will continue to seek opportunities to open new CTCs in
deprived inner city areas.

e We will ensure that more schools, especially in the inner cities,
have the opportunity to develop their technological expertise.

Tackling crime and the fear of crime forms a vital part of the strategy to
make our inner cities better places to live and work. The Safer Cities
initiative, launched in 1988, has successfully brought together local groups
and agencies to tackle crime in some of our worst affected urban areas.
Twenty schemes are already in operation.

e¢ We will double the number of Safer Cities Schemes to cover 40
urban areas.

i
a LONDON

London is a magnet to visitors and business from across the world. Since
1979 we have invested heavily to secure that status. Billions of pounds have
gone into improving air, rail and underground links. We will continue that
programme of modernisation. We are determined to sustain into the next
century London's special position as one of the world's leading capital cities.
We reject Labour's plan to recreate a bureaucratic and wasteful GLC.
Instead, as part of our Millennium programme, we will launch a London
2000 initiative. The Secretary of State for the Environment will convene a
new private sector forum to promote London internationally as a business,
tourist and cultural centre. The Secretary of State will also chair a new
Cabinet sub-committee to bring together Ministers from all key departments
and co-ordinate policy for the further improvement of London. A single
Minister will be given responsibility for co-ordinating London's transport
services. London's place as a world centre for financial and insurance
services is pre-eminent; we intend to keep it that way And we will support
the vigorous cultural life of the capital, which has seen new galleries,
theatres and museums opening over the last decade.

¢ We will launch a London 2000 initiative.

¢ We will convene a new private sector forum to promote London's
position internationally.

¢ We will establish a new Cabinet sub committee to co-ordinate
policy on London.

e We will give a single Transport Minister responsibility for services
in London. He will chair a new Transport Working Group which
will bring together public transport operators from both public
and private sectors - to discuss transport issues in London.

“THE COUNTRYSIDE
We have always cared for the countryside. We support its major industries

and way of life, while recognising the place it holds in the hearts of those
who live in towns.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 60 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We want to protect our most beautiful landscapes, conserve the abundance
and variety of our wildlife and habitats, promote access and public
enjoyment of the countryside, and encourage public participation in caring
for the countryside.

But the countryside is more than just a pretty picture. It is a place where
people live and work, as they have done in the past and will do in the future.
In providing our public services, we will continue to recognise the particular
needs of people who live in the countryside.

¢ We will continue to promote a diverse rural economy, balancing
the need for jobs, housing and services in rural areas with
protection of the rural environment.

i
a AGRICULTURE

Centuries of farming have shaped our countryside. Now farming is at a
crossroads, both here and in the rest of the European Community World-
wide pressure to reduce protectionist measures, and the need to contain the
cost of the Common Agricultural Policy, mean that farmers will face reduced
support and increased competition.

We believe that farming in the UK can meet these challenges. But many
farmers will need help to adapt to the new conditions, and we will continue
to provide assistance.

It will become increasingly important for farmers to obtain a greater
proportion of their income from the market. We will encourage farmers,
retailers and manufacturers to work together to increase our share of the
European food market.

We are committed to reducing the burden of regulation on business in
general, and farming in particular. We will not accept UK farmers being put
at a disadvantage by EC laws being applied differently in other countries.

Responsible farmers have always combined efficient farming with care for
the countryside. We will continue to encourage this approach through
schemes to protect landscape and habitats of special importance. We will
also maintain direct support for farming in the Less Favoured Areas in ways
which encourage good environmental practice

¢ We will seek a reform of the CAP which brings agriculture closer
to the market; reduces the costs to taxpayers and consumers; is
implemented at a pace which the industry can bear; affects all
Community farmers equitably, regardless of size or location; and
recognises the importance of environmental protection.

¢ We will build on the producer marketing initiatives which we have
already launched, including the Group Marketing Grant.

© We will assist the Milk Marketing Board's move to a new
structure which will be better able to protect the interests of

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 61 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

producers and consumers in the Single Market.

¢ We will publish target response times for grant and licence
applications made to the Ministry of Agriculture.

¢ We will take forward proposals for radical liberalisation of the
agricultural tenancy laws in order to make more land available
for rent, especially for new entrants.

e We will enforce effective pollution control regulations while
helping farmers to meet the high standards required.

e We will press for an agreement in the EC's Agricultural Council
which will allow us to provide financial encouragement for
organic agriculture.

A
a FORESTRY

Forestry is a traditional rural industry, which also affects the landscape, and
gives pleasure to millions of people. The needs of a successful industry,
landscape conservation, and public access must all be accommodated; and
we will reorganise the Forestry Commission to reflect these objectives more
effectively.

¢ We will plant a new national forest in the Midlands and
community forests elsewhere.

¢ We will review the effectiveness of the current incentives for
forestry investment.

¢ We will produce guidance on the preparation of local Indicative
Forestry Strategies designed to encourage new woodlands, while
steering planting away from sensitive areas.

?
FISHING

Fishing is a vital industry in many parts of our islands. Many fishermen have
done well in recent years but they now face great pressure on the fish stocks.
This means that fishing quotas are likely to fall in coming years in order to
preserve the long-term future of the fisheries. We will continue to work for
the profitable and sustainable future of our fishing fleet.

e We are determined to see that the renegotiation of the Common
Fisheries Policy protects the interests of UK fishermen and retains our
share of the Community's fishing opportunities.

e We will introduce a balanced package of measures, including
decommissioning and controls on fishing activity, to conserve fish and
safeguard the future of the industry.

“RURAL JOBS AND SERVICES
Changes in agriculture and other traditional industries will affect

employment opportunities in the countryside. We will continue to target help
through the Rural Development Commission, and ask the RDC to review the

Rural Development Areas to ensure that its efforts are targeted on the areas
of most need. We are committed to developing tourism in ways which
provide all-year-round jobs and bring benefit to less well-known parts of our
countryside, without damaging the environment. We have recently published
new planning policy guidance which makes it clear how the countryside can
benefit from new businesses and jobs, if the location and design of
development are handled with sensitivity

In local government, many of our shire counties and districts have led the
way in raising the quality of public service. Local post offices, local
transport and local schools all have an important role to play in sustaining
tural life.

e We will consult on our recently published draft planning policy
guidance designed to provide a clear framework for decisions on
developments to aid tourism.

¢ We will widen the availability of the Rural Development
Commission's successful Redundant Buildings Grant Scheme, and
strengthen other RDC programmes.

¢ We will maintain our special programmes to promote affordable
homes in rural areas.

¢ We are fully committed to maintaining a national network of post
offices.

¢ We will continue to assist local authorities who want to subsidise
rural transport.

e We will enable village schools that wish to apply for Grant-
Maintained status to do so in small groups, thus enabling them to
share management tasks while still enjoying the benefits of
independence.

e The expansion of GP fund-holding will bring particular benefits to
rural areas because of the convenience of different services - such
as physiotherapy and consultant appointments - being offered in
the GP's surgery.

CARING FOR THE COUNTRYSIDE

Some of our finest landscapes are designated as National Parks. All National
Park authorities will become independent Boards, which will make it easier
for them to carry out their tasks effectively The New Forest will be given a
statutory status which will give it as great a level of protection as any
National Park.

Last summer the Government launched an experiment in Countryside
Stewardship’. This aims to conserve, enhance and re-create fine landscapes
so that they may be enjoyed and appreciated by the public. The response
from farmers, landowners and environmental bodies has been very positive.
We therefore propose to expand the scheme and to introduce a new scheme
to preserve hedgerows - a much valued feature of the English landscape, and
a haven for wildlife.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 63 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

The Government endorsed and supported the Countryside Commission's
target designed to bring 120,000 miles of rights of way into good order by
the end of the century.

At parish level, individuals can work together either to safeguard the
character of their local village, or to improve its appearance. Local action
can also preserve local wildlife and habitats. Under the Rural Environmental
Action Scheme, grants of up to £2,000 per project will be available to
support local environmental action.

The Government is keen to promote the fullest possible use of inland
waterways for leisure, recreation and amenity, in the regeneration of inner
cities and for freight transport where appropriate. But we recognise that the
various uses of canals and rivers must be properly managed to protect the
character and environment of the waterways.

e We will expand the Countryside Stewardship Scheme to cover the
conservation of historic landscapes, meadows, pasture and
hedgerows. Public access to qualifying schemes will be
encouraged.

¢ We will introduce a Hedgerow Incentive Scheme to help preserve
hedgerows of particular historic, landscape or wildlife importance.

e We will contribute to the Countryside Commission's new Parish
Path Partnership designed to stimulate local maintenance and
improvement schemes.

e We will continue to support the development and redevelopment
of our canals, as well as enhancing the environmental standards of
our waterways.

?

THE ENVIRONMENT

The Conservative Party's commitment to the environment is beyond doubt.
Other parties promise the earth. We have taken action - both nationally and
internationally - to preserve it.

Environmental protection can impose financial costs on producers,
consumers and taxpayers, so we must make sure the threat of damage is a
real one. But we also accept the precautionary principle - the need to act,
where there is significant risk of damage, before the scientific evidence is
conclusive. And we recognise that higher environmental standards can offer
new opportunities for business.

We published the first comprehensive White Paper on the Environment in
1990. It covered everything from the stratosphere to the street corner. We
will continue to publish annual progress reports.

This Conservative Government has taken a lead in working to protect the

ozone layer. We will strive to accelerate the eradication of ozone depleting
substances.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 64 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

One of the most important issues facing all countries is the threat of global
warming. Effective action to combat global warming must be international
action. Again we have taken a lead. The Prime Minister was the first world
leader to announce his intention to attend the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro
this June. We have said that we will consider stabilising our CO2 emissions
earlier than our existing conditional target of 2005. We have promised to
provide new and additional resources to help the developing countries to
tackle their environmental problems.

Within Britain, and ahead of other European countries, we have introduced
the concept of integrated pollution control.

We have set up, for the first time, powerful co-ordinating machinery within
Whitehall to ensure that environmental considerations are given due weight
in all decision-making.

We are committed to openness on environmental matters. We support the
establishment of a European Environment Agency to provide a Europe-wide
environmental database. We believe that the public should have access to
information held by the pollution control authorities. Public registers are
now provided by bodies such as the National Rivers Authority and Her
Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution.

¢ We will establish a new Environment Agency which will bring
together the functions of the National Rivers Authority, Her
Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution and the waste regulation
functions of local authorities.

e The new EA will have a statutory duty to publish an annual State
of the Environment report.

¢ Within the European Community we will press for the
introduction of integrated pollution control on the UK model.

TOWARDS THE MILLENNIUM

A more prosperous Britain can afford to be ambitious. We can aspire to
excellence in the arts, broadcasting and sport. We can use our increased
leisure time, energy and money, to improve life for ourselves and our
families. The National Lottery we propose to introduce can be used to
restore our heritage and promote projects which will become a source of
national pride.

National Lotteries have been found useful at several times in our history.
The British Museum was founded out of the proceeds of such a lottery.
Fourteen years ago, a Royal Commission recommended the creation of a
National Lottery in Britain to provide extra money for deserving causes. The
case has become even stronger as British people gain more opportunities to
participate in foreign lotteries - thus increasing the risk that funds which we
could put to good use in Britain will be diverted abroad.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 65 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We believe a well-run, carefully controlled form of national lottery would be
popular, while raising money for many good causes.

We will canvass views on how such a lottery should be run and controlled,
and how it would fit within the pattern of charitable fund-raising in Britain.

We believe that the funds generated by a National Lottery should be used to
enhance the life of our nation. People who enjoy the arts, sport, Britain's
heritage and fine countryside could all benefit from the proceeds from a
National Lottery. Charities, right across the country and covering such areas
as medical research, will also be potential beneficiaries.

i
a THE MILLENNIUM FUND

We will be consulting widely on the best way to distribute the proceeds of a
lottery. But we have decided that part of the proceeds should be put aside,
year by year, into a Millennium Fund specifically dedicated to projects
which will commemorate the start of the twenty-first century and will be
enjoyed by future generations.

e We therefore propose to introduce a National Lottery from 1994,
which would help provide funds for a number of good causes in
the artistic, sporting, heritage and charitable fields - and from
which some funds would be put aside for a Millennium Fund.

The Millennium Fund could be used, for example:

¢ To restore the fabric of our nation: our great inheritance of
buildings which symbolise and enrich our national life.

¢ To help endow our cities and regions with facilities to enhance the
celebration of United Kingdom 2000, such as the sporting facilities
Manchester would need to host the 2000 Olympics.

¢ To help another major city - chosen by competition - to hold an
international trade fair designed to be a showcase of British
innovation for the twenty-first century.

¢ To enable voluntary groups and local communities to bid for
funding for their own Millennium projects for local restoration
schemes, or for improving the amenities of canals and rivers, as a
source of enjoyment for local people and a habitat for wildlife.

¢ To provide Millennium bursaries for young people (and newly
retired people) offering their time, energy and commitment to
schemes designed to change the face of the United Kingdom by the
year 2000.

“THE ARTS
Britain has a great artistic heritage and a lively contemporary arts scene. The

arts have flourished in recent years, with growing attendance at theatre,
opera, dance and arts festivals.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 66 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

We have supported this by increasing the public funding of the arts, by 60
per cent in real terms since 1979, and introducing new incentives to personal
giving. The arts have also forged new partnerships with local authorities,
businesses and private patrons. Business sponsorship in particular has
expanded hugely.

We have set up new Regional Arts Boards and supported the Scottish and
Welsh Arts Councils in order to diversify and enrich cultural life throughout
the country.

We have financed the European Arts Festival to be held throughout Britain
during our Presidency of the Community in the second half of this year, as
well as the first National Music Day in June.

In this year's Budget, we announced further tax relief on film-making in this
country. Our aim is to make the performing arts, museums and our heritage
accessible to all. We will encourage the young to become involved and will
facilitate access for the disabled.

¢ The National Lottery will provide a new source of finance for the
arts.

e We will maintain support for the arts and continue to develop
schemes for greater sponsorship in co-operation with business and
private individuals.

e We will re-examine the role of the Arts Council, as many of its
functions are now carried out regionally.

e We will continue our support of libraries as educational, cultural
and community centres, and urge local authorities to keep up
standards. We will complete the new British Library building for
which we have provided £450 million.

A
= SPORT

Success in sport is a source of national pride. Enjoyment of sport can enrich
every life. We have given strong support to the Sports Council and its efforts
to raise participation in sport. We actively support Manchester's bid to bring
the Olympic Games to Britain.

We want to restore the good image of football. Tough action has cut down
football hooliganism. We have helped to establish the Football Trust, which
now devotes £20 million a year to improving the safety of grounds.

Under the National Curriculum all primary and secondary age pupils will
follow a course of PE. All pupils will be taught to swim by the age of 11.

We will continue to encourage private sector sponsorship of sport. We will
encourage more effective use of local sport and leisure facilities through
compulsory competitive tendering. We want to see more dual use of school
playing fields and halls and will give schools more freedom in their
management.

We are asking Local Education Authorities not to make sales of school
playing fields in future unless there is no evidence of long-term need.

¢ Sport, too, will benefit from the resources generated by the
National Lottery

e We will actively support Britain's bid to host the 2000 Olympic
Games in Manchester. We will provide £55 million towards the
preparation of the site and key facilities in the first stage of the
bid, and we will ensure that the project, whether successful or not,
contributes to the effective regeneration of East Manchester.

¢ We will set up a new Business Sponsorship for Sport scheme. This
is expected to raise £6 million in its first year to support local and
youth sport.

i
a OUR HERITAGE

Public interest and involvement in Britain's heritage has never been greater.
We have created in the past decade English Heritage and the National
Heritage Memorial Fund to give greater focus and drive to the Government's
policies. The National Trust and private owners take a leading part in
preserving our almost unrivalled heritage. Government will work in
partnership to secure our heritage for the benefit of future generations.

Our cathedrals are among our national glories. We therefore launched the
Cathedral Repair Grant Scheme in April 1991, providing £11.5 million over
three years.

We have increased, to £12 million, the grant to the NHMF for the purchase
of historic properties, objects and collections. The Government also provides
help to private owners through English Heritage repair grants, and tax relief
in return for commitments on upkeep and public access.

We want to preserve the special character of our old town and city centres.
We will encourage councils to ensure that new developments are in character
with the past; to maintain buildings of importance to the character of towns
and cities; to limit unnecessary street furniture and signs; and to plant trees
and preserve historic patterns and open spaces.

e The National Lottery will also provide funds for the preservation
of our heritage.

e We will continue to provide substantial financial assistance for the
protection and preservation of the heritage.

¢ Together with the heritage agencies, we will work to make
heritage sites accessible to the public.

?
BROADCASTING

We are proud of our record of extending choice, encouraging new producers
and maintaining high standards in broadcasting. We opened the way to the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 68 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

setting-up of Channel 4, independent radio, satellite television and multi-
channel cable TV networks. The 1990 Broadcasting Act means that three
new independent radio services and a fifth television channel will be set up
during the next Parliament.

Over two million homes already receive satellite TV We have now licensed
well over a hundred cable TV networks and this new industry expects to
invest £3,000 million over the next five years. In coming years, British
viewers will have an increasing choice of channels and programmes. The
new and sophisticated cable networks will open the way not only to new
telecommunication services, but also to the spread of emerging technologies
such as high definition television.

We attach great importance to the work of the Broadcasting Standards
Council, which we set up under the 1990 Act. All television and radio
companies accept the need to maintain standards of taste and decency in
their treatment of sex and violence and their use of bad language.

The European Community regulates standards in satellite broadcasts
originating from each Member State. We were one of the first countries to
ratify a new Council of Europe convention applying similar rules to all its
Member States. We also, in the Broadcasting Act, brought in sanctions
against the transmission of offensive satellite broadcasts from abroad, and
made it an offence for advertisers and equipment suppliers to support such
programmes.

Independent television producers are benefiting from the requirement put on
the BBC and ITV to commission a quarter of all their programmes,
excluding the news, from outsiders. There are now great opportunities for
independent producers to sell their programmes to new television channels
and international markets, and there is much greater choice for viewers as a
result.

In 1996, the BBC's Charter comes up for renewal. This will be considered
against the background of the much more varied and competitive
broadcasting environment which our policies have created. It is important
that there should be a wide public debate about the future direction the BBC
should take.

¢ We will back the work of the Broadcasting Standards Council and
remain vigilant about ensuring high standards in satellite
broadcasts from abroad.

e We will publish a discussion paper on the future of the BBC
recognising its special responsibilities for providing public service
broadcasting.

A UNITED KINGDOM

The United Kingdom is far greater than the sum of its parts. Over many
centuries its nations have worked, and frequently fought, side by side.

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Together, we have made a unique mark on history Together, we hold a
special place in international affairs. To break up the Union now would
diminish our influence for good in the world, just at the time when it is most
needed.

Nationalist plans for independence are a recipe for weakness and isolation.
Higher taxes and political uncertainty would deter investment and destroy
jobs. The costly Labour and Liberal devolution proposals for Scotland and
Wales have the same drawbacks. They do not intend to bring about
separation, but run that risk. They could feed, but not resolve, grievances
that arise in different parts of Britain. They would deprive Scotland and
Wales of their rightful seats in the United Kingdom Cabinet, seats the
Conservatives are determined to preserve. We believe strongly that we
should go on working together in full partnership in a Union that has served
every part of the United Kingdom well.

The plans for devolution put forward by the other parties would have a grave
impact not just on Scotland and Wales, but also on England. They propose
new and costly regional assemblies in England, for which there is no
demand. We will oppose all such unnecessary layers of government.

The Union has brought us strength both economically and politically Yet it
has preserved the historic and cultural diversity of our islands. Our
constitution is flexible, fair and tolerant. It has made this country one of the
best places in which to live, work and bring up our children. These benefits
cannot be tossed away lightly We will fight to preserve the Union, a promise
which only the Conservatives can give at this election.

A
a SCOTLAND

Scotland has achieved an economic and cultural regeneration over the past
13 years. The Scottish economy has responded vigorously to the policies we
have introduced to liberate enterprise, and many more people are now
saving, investing and owning their homes. The public services are better
funded and more efficient. There has been a flowering of Scottish culture.

Scotland enjoys a rich and distinct tradition and her own institutions, which
we have preserved and strengthened. Scotland has its own framework for the
encouragement of enterprise, investment and training; its own education
system which continues to excel, with more pupils leaving school better
qualified and more going on to further and higher education; its own health
budgets which deliver high standards of care; and its own glorious
inheritance of buildings and countryside.

A separate Manifesto for Scotland sets out our record in detail and our
proposals for building on these achievements. In this document, therefore,

we list only a selection.

e Business in Scotland has received a boost from our creation of

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1992/1992-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 70 of 75

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

Scottish Enterprise and the Local Enterprise Companies. We have
formed Scottish Trade International to help our exporters, as
Locate in Scotland does for inward investors. To assist business
further, we will complete the harmonisation of business rates in
Scotland with those in the rest of the country.

e The massive bureaucracies and layers of local government have
few supporters in Scotland. We will continue to press local
authorities to provide the value for money and the quality of
services that people expect. We will press ahead with the reform of
the current burdensome system of local government by
introducing single tier councils throughout Scotland.

¢ We will continue to strengthen Scotland's education system for the
benefit of parents, pupils and teachers. We will respond to the
proposals of the Howie Committee to ensure that upper secondary
education matches the best in Europe. We will continue to
increase the number of places in higher and further education and
will complete our reforms of the system.

¢ We will extend our reforms to improve NHS patient care in
Scotland. Scotland has led the way in setting limits to waiting-
times for operations and will now be reducing these further.

e We are creating a new body, Scottish Natural Heritage, with
overall responsibility for conserving the natural environment. We
will go further, and will create a Scottish Environmental
Protection Agency to bring together powers to ensure the quality
of our air, rivers and bathing waters.

a
a WALES

Since 1979, the economy of Wales has changed spectacularly With only 5
per cent of the United Kingdom's population, Wales has consistently enjoyed
20 per cent of its inward investment. New industries have sprung up. Self-
employment has risen by two-thirds. Welsh manufacturing now has the
highest productivity of any part in the United Kingdom.

Land made derelict by old industries has been reclaimed on a massive scale.
The Cardiff Bay development and the Ebbw Vale Garden Festival are
outstanding examples, together with the Programme for the Valleys.

Since 1979, we have spent more than £3,000 million on roads in Wales.
Spending on health has increased by 60 per cent in real terms since 1979.
We have spent more than £5 million on our radical Waiting Times Initiative,
leading to the treatment of 35,000 extra patients. In school we are spending
nearly half as much again, in real terms per pupil, as in 1979. And there has
been an enormous expansion in the training budget.

More Welsh homes - 72 per cent - are owned by those who live in them than
in the United Kingdom as a whole. Since the 'Right to Buy' was introduced
in 1980, we have enabled almost 90,000 council and housing association
tenants to buy their own homes.

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

A separate Manifesto, in both English and Welsh, sets out our full
programme for building on these achievements for Wales.

e We will set up a Welsh Economic Council to bring together the
various bodies with interests in inward investment, tourism and
small business to advise the Secretary of State.

¢ We aim to remove all significant dereliction from Wales by the end
of the new Parliament.

e We will promote the work of the Countryside Council for Wales,
in order to protect the countryside and those who earn their
livelihood there.

e We will give further resources to our Rural Initiative. And we will
continue to support hill farmers through the Hill Livestock
Compensatory Allowances.

¢ We will continue to invest heavily in road improvements,
including the second Severn Bridge, completing the M4 in South
Wales and the M5 in North Wales.

e We will continue with our record hospital building programme.

e We will continue to offer generous funding for Housing for Wales
and concentrate our efforts on the special needs of rural Wales.
All major publicly funded housing developments will make
adequate provision for the less well off.

e We will introduce a new Welsh Language Act.

¢ We will publish a White Paper on local government reform this
autumn with a view to establishing unitary authorities, based on
the historic counties and county boroughs. We will ensure a full
role for Community Councils under these arrangements.

i
a NORTHERN IRELAND

We have upheld our pledge that Northern Ireland will remain an integral part
of the United Kingdom in accordance with the democratically expressed
wishes of the majority of the people who live there. It is a pledge that only
the Conservative and Unionist Party can give. Conservative candidates are
standing in our name and in that cause.

Our overriding objective in Northern Ireland is to eliminate the evil of
terrorism. This requires progress in four areas: security, economic, social and
political. The security forces in Northern Ireland perform their duties with
courage and professionalism. They are entitled to expect all the necessary
encouragement, and legal and material support from the Government. Under
the Conservatives, the strength of the RUC has been increased, while the
Emergency Provisions Act 1991 contains new powers to combat terrorist
funding.

Northern Ireland is sharing in the economic transformation of the United
Kingdom as a result of Conservative policies. Belfast is attracting significant
new private investment. Harland and Wolff and Shorts have been
successfully privatised. Major work is also under way to regenerate
Londonderry and many of Ulster's smaller towns. We will continue to pursue

policies to encourage enterprise and bring new jobs - by contrast with
Labour, whose plan for a national minimum wage would hit the Province
particularly hard.

In the new Parliament we will continue to seek to re-establish stable
institutions of Government in Northern Ireland, so that powers currently
exercised by Ministers in the Northern Ireland Office can be returned to
locally-elected politicians.

¢ We will always give the security forces our full backing within the
rule of the law, and - against Labour opposition - ensure that they
have the special powers they need to protect the whole community
from violence.

¢ We will complete the privatisation of Northern Ireland Electricity,
transfer the water and sewage services to the private sector, and
examine ways of bringing private sector skills into the
management of Northern Ireland Railways.

¢ We will continue to pursue policies designed to alleviate social
needs, to promote equity of treatment and to widen the sense of
common purpose which is growing in the Province.

e We will build on the close security co operation that has been
established with the Republic of Ireland under the Anglo-Irish
Agreement.

e We will continue to work strenuously for a political agreement
which is acceptable to all the parties involved in the talks which
the Secretary of State has had during the past year with the main
constitutional parties in Northern Ireland and the Government of
the Republic of Ireland. They have provided a firm basis for
political progress in Ulster, and for building new relationships
both between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and in these
islands as a whole.

YOUR CHOICE AT THIS ELECTION

This Election is about the future. Your future. Britain's future. Our future
role in the world. This is a time to go forward with conviction and
confidence, not to go back to the failure and bitter controversies of the past.

It is difficult to remember the Britain we were elected to transform in 1979.
The country we did transform.

It was a depressed and divided country, accustomed to failure and suspicious
of change.

During the succeeding Parliaments, we have curbed inflation, reformed trade
union law; encouraged enterprise, cut taxes, modernised our education and
training, improved the management of our health service, given more help to
the needy, extended ownership, helped through our vigilance to end the Cold
War, widened our influence in Europe, and earned the respect of the world.

1992 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

A decade of success ended with the problems of recession - a world
recession. We know how tough it has been for many but we are poised to
move forward again, lacking only the spark of confidence with which a
Conservative victory would ignite recovery.

?
THE CHALLENGE AHEAD

The challenges of the 1990s demand a responsible and sure-footed
government which understands the nature of the achievements of the 1980s
and is ready to build successfully on them. A government committed to the
principles of choice, ownership, responsibility and opportunity; committed
to low inflation and low taxes; committed to better quality and value in our
public services; committed to strong defences. Labour cannot provide that
leadership. They lack experience, principle and vision.

With Socialism everywhere in rout or retreat, it is unclear what the Labour
Party stands for. For public consumption, Labour leaders purport to have
jettisoned the principles of a life-time. But how much can they be trusted?
How genuine is the conversion and what do they actually believe?

It is clear only that Labour would threaten our achievements, undo our
reforms and hamstring Britain. They would turn the clock back to policies
that impoverished and divided our country. Socialism here and abroad is the
regret of yesterday not the hope of tomorrow.

A
a ONLY THE BEST FOR BRITAIN

We believe that only the best is good enough for Britain, and that the best
will only be accomplished if we give the British people the freedom and the
opportunity they need to succeed.

We have a new leader, proven in office, and a new agenda - yet a tried set of
principles. Those principles reflect our conviction that Britain has done best
when the people of Britain have been given the personal incentive to
succeed. National success has not been primarily the result of accidents of
geography, landscape and natural resources. Nor has it been the result of
government action and state control. Success has been won when we have
given our people their head: when their natural skills, talents, energy; thrift
and inventiveness have been released, not suppressed. That was true when
this century began; it is still true as this century draws to its close.

Britain should approach the Millennium with head and spirits high, with a
strong economy, with a high standard of living, with generously endowed
and well managed public services, and with secure defences. We want
Britain to be an example to the world of how a free people can make the
very best of their destiny. That prospect is within the grasp of us all. We
must now make it happen.

The prize is great, the hope invigorating, the dream attainable. We want,

with you, to make the dream a reality. A Conservative Government will help
you to achieve the very best. The very best future for Britain.

1987 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

The Next Moves Forward
FOREWORD

In the last eight years our country has changed - changed for the better.

We have discovered a new strength and a new pride. We have fostered a new
spirit of enterprise. We have risen to fresh challenges at home and abroad.
Once again our economy is strong. Our industries are flourishing.
Unemployment is falling.

Founded on this new prosperity, we are building a better Health Service and
providing more care for those in need. Living standards are higher than ever
before. Our people have the protection of a stronger defence and more
police.

Britain has come right by her own efforts. We trusted in the character and
talents of our people. The British instinct is for choice and independence.
Given the opportunities provided by Conservative policies, many more
families now enjoy the pride of ownership of homes, of shares and of
pensions.

Together we are building One Nation of free, prosperous and responsible
families and people. A Conservative dream is at last becoming a reality.

This Manifesto points the way forward.

Margaret Thatcher

The British Revival

This manifesto sets out our vision for the Britain of the 1990s and beyond, a
future based on the aspirations of millions of individuals and their families
their hopes, their needs, their security. For the first time in a generation this
country looks forward to an era of real prosperity and fulfilment.

A vast change separates the Britain of today from the Britain of the late
1970s. Is it really only such a short time ago that inflation rose to an annual
rate of 27 per cent? That the leader of the Transport and General Workers'
Union was widely seen as the most powerful man in the land? That a

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

minority Labour Government, staggering from crisis to crisis on borrowed
money, was nonetheless maintained in power by the Liberal Party in return
for the paper concession of a Lib-Lab pact? And that Labour's much-vaunted
pay pact with the unions collapsed in the industrial anarchy of the ""winter of
discontent"", n which the dead went unburied, rubbish piled up in the streets
and the country was gripped by a creeping paralysis which Labour was
powerless to cure?

It seems in retrospect to be the history of another country. Yet these things
happened and people had to accept them as an unavoidable part of everyday
life.

Reversing the Decline

Remember the conventional wisdom of the day. The British people were
""ungovernable"". We were in the grip of an incurable ""British disease"".
Britain was heading for ""irreversible decline"".

Well, the people were not ungovernable, the disease was not incurable, the
decline has been reversed.

e Britain today is in the seventh successive year of steady economic
growth. We have moved from the bottom to the top of the growth
league of major European countries.

¢ In Britain today. inflation has reached its lowest levels for almost
twenty years.

¢ In Britain today, the number of strikes has dropped to the lowest levels
for 50 years.

¢ In Britain today. far from being in debt to the IMF, we have built up
our net overseas assets to their highest level since the Second World
War - higher than France, Germany and the United States, second only
to Japan.

¢ In Britain today. living standards are higher than ever before in our
history.

But these are bald statistics. What matters is the feel of the country - the new
enthusiasm for enterprise, the new spirit that Britain can make it, that we can
prosper with the best. Investment in British industry is rising strongly. Our
services sector, employing almost two-thirds of our workforce, generates a
vast surplus of foreign earnings. And our manufacturers are travelling the
globe with a new confidence born of the knowledge that Britain is
internationally competitive again.

The World Stage

This national revival is not confined to increased economic strength. Britain
is also playing a major part on the international stage. From the White House
through Europe to the Kremlin our voice is heard on arms control, on East-
West issues, on human rights, on the Middle East and on African affairs.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

With the Conservative Government, Britain has played a strong and
responsible role internationally. We have defended civilised values by
fighting terrorism relentlessly. We have secured our national interests, as
when we liberated the Falklands. We have been ready to settle long-standing
issues like Hong Kong where we reached an agreement to safeguard the way
of life of the people.

Time and again we have shown that we possess the essential requirements of
successful diplomacy: we stand firm on principles yet are ready to negotiate
and prepared to take decisive action.

Founded in Strength

The ability to act internationally does not come without effort. It must be
founded on a strong economy and a robust defence. This Government took
the necessary steps to build up both. Success has followed.

¢ Prudent financial policies have made Britain one of the world's largest
creditors. Today we are able to shape world efforts to sustain trade and
promote international monetary co-operation.

e We gave a lead in NATO and installed Cruise missiles. Today, as a
result, the Soviet Union is at last prepared to negotiate to remove its
own missiles targeted against us.

¢ This Government is modernising our own independent deterrent.
Today Britain retains an independent influence in arms control
negotiations between the superpowers.

By such steadfastness, we have not only rebuilt our economy and re-
established our world reputation; we have also regained our national self-
respect. But restoring a country's greatness is not easy. The new
Conservative policies met bitter resistance every step of the way.

Remember:

The year-long coal strike, with its violence and intimidation on a massive
scale. It failed and mining productivity has since soared.

The battle we had to fight to ensure that Britain paid no more than its fair
share of the European Community Budget. We now get automatic rebates -
this year, over £1.3 billion.

The doubling of the oil price which confronted the new Government with a
world-wide recession - and, more recently, an equally dramatic fall in the oil
price which halved government oil revenues and in earlier times would have
threatened a collapse of confidence in the pound. Both these oil ""shocks""
were successfully withstood by prudent policies which have produced a
sustained growth of prosperity.

And let us not forget the challenge of the Falklands War.

How many of the alternative governments on offer would have stood firm,

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

overcome, or even survived such difficulties? Does anyone suppose that the
Labour Party would have resisted, let alone defeated, the violence and
intimidation in the coal strike? Or that the Liberals or the Social Democrats
would have fought so hard for our rebate from the Europ6an Community?
Or that any of the Opposition parties would have persevered through all
these difficulties to break the back of inflation and restore honest money?

A Strong and Stable Government

How has it been done? All these improvements in the wealth and standing of
our country have only been possible because we have had a strong
government with sound policies and a decisive majority in Parliament. A
weak government with uncertain policies would not have known how to
withstand the pressures upon it; a government without a good overall
majority in Parliament would not have been allowed to do so; and a strong
government with unsolind policies would have been a positive force for
disaster.

In this election, only the Conservative Party is offering strong, decisive and
united government.

The Next Moves Forward

The next Conservative Government will build on the achievements of the
past eight years with a full programme of positive reform.

We will continue:

¢ to pursue policies of sound financial management, the conquest of
inflation, the promotion of enterprise and the growth of employment;

¢ to spread the ownership of homes, shares, pensions and savings ever
more widely to give families greater financial independence;

* to give people greater choice and responsibility over their own lives in
important areas such as housing and education;

¢ to improve the well-being of the people through better health care, and
to safeguard the living standards of those who have to depend on the
community;

¢ to improve the quality of life by conserving the best of our heritage
and our countryside, and by fostering provision for the arts and sport;

¢ to exercise strong leadership where government needs to be strong in
protecting the nation against potential aggression and the citizen
against lawlessness.

We intend to press on with the radical Conservative reform which we

embarked upon in 1979, and which has already revived the spirit of our
people and restored the reputation of our country.

Wider Ownership and Greater Opportunity

Conservatives aim to extend as widely as possible the opportunity to own

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

property and build up capital, to exercise real choice in education, and to
develop economic independence and security.

Our goal is a capital-owning democracy of people and families who exercise
power over their own lives n the most direct way. They would take the
important decisions - as tenants, home-owners, parents, employees, and
trade unionists rather than having them taken for them.

Of course, it is not possible to give people independence. That is something
we must all achieve by our own efforts. But what this Conservative
Government has done is to make it easier for people to acquire
independence for themselves:

¢ by introducing the right to buy council houses;

¢ by returning nationalised industries to the people in ways that
encourage the widest possible spread of ownership;

¢ by making it easier to buy shares in British industry through employee
share schemes and Personal Equity Plans.

These opportunities - all too often introduced n the teeth of fierce resistance
from the Opposition parties - have achieved spectacular results. There has
been a surge of home-ownership, share-ownership and self-reliance.

And because these first-time shareholders and home-owners are more
independent, they develop a more independent outlook. They are no longer
content that some of the most important decisions in their lives what school
their children attend, for example, or whether or not to go on strike should
be taken by officialdom or trade union bosses. People want to decide such
things for themselves.

In this way the scope of individual responsibility is widened, the family is
strengthened, and voluntary bodies flourish. State power is checked and
opportunities are spread throughout society. Ownership and independence
cease to be the privileges of a few and become the birthright of all.

In this way One Nation is finally reached not by a single people being
conscripted into an organised socialist programme but by millions of people
building their own lives in their own way.

Better Housing for All
Home Ownership

Nowhere has the spread of ownership been more significant than in housing.
Buying their own home is the first step most people take towards building up
capital to hand down to their children and grandchildren. It gives people a
stake in society - something to conserve. It is the foundation stone of a
capital-owning democracy.

A home should be a source of pride and independence to the family living in
it, regardless of whether it is owned or rented. We will ensure that every

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

family in the land has the opportunity to make it so.

Home-ownership has been the great success story of housing policy in the
last eight years. One million council tenants have become home-owners and
another one and a half million more families have become home-owners for
the first time.

Two out of every three homes are now owned by the people who live in
them. This is a very high proportion, one of the largest in the world. We are
determined to make it larger still.

Some people are still deterred by the costs and complications of house
purchase. That is why we must look for new ways to make house-buying
simpler and easier. Our abolition of the conveyancing monopoly has already
made it cheaper.

We will keep the present system of mortgage tax relief.

We will target improvement grants to where they are most needed - to the
least well-off. To meet the special needs of old people, we will ensure that
all local authorities have powers to give improvement grants, where
necessary, for properties where elderly people move in with relatives. We
will extend the 30 per cent housing association grant to help schemes for old
people.

A Right To Rent

Most problems in housing now arise in the rented sector. Controls, although
well-meant, have dramatically reduced the private rented accommodation to
a mere 8 per cent of the housing market.

This restricts housing choice and hinders the economy. People looking for
work cannot easily move to a different area to do so. Those who find work
may not be able to find rented accommodation nearby. Those who would
prefer to rent rather than buy are forced to become reluctant owner-occupiers
or to swell the queue for council houses. Some may even become
temporarily homeless.

And it is not only these people and their families who suffer from the
shortage of homes for rent. The economy as a whole is damaged when
workers cannot move to fill jobs because there are no homes to rent in the
neighbourhood.

This must be remedied. We have already taken some modest steps in this
direction by making it easier to part-own and part-rent homes through shared
ownership; by bringing in and widening the scheme for assured tenancies;
by our system of shortholds; and by providing a new 30 per cent housing
association grant to build hostels for young workers. We have also directly
tackled the problem of homelessness through new grants to housing
associations and other measures.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

More must now be done. The next Conservative Government, having
already implemented the right to buy, will increase practical opportunities to
rent.

We must attract new private investment into rented housing - both from large
institutions such as building societies and housing associations as well as
from small private landlords. To do this we intend, in particular, to build on
two initiatives we have already taken.

First, to encourage more investment by institutions, we will extend the
system of assured tenancies. This will permit new lettings in which rents and
the period of lease will be freely agreed between tenants and landlords. The
tenant will have security of tenure and will renegotiate the rent at the end of
the lease, with provision for arbitration if necessary.

Second, to encourage new lettings by smaller landlords, we will develop the
system of shorthold. The rents of landlords will be limited to a reasonable
rate of return, and the tenant's security of tenure will be limited to the term
of the lease, which would be not less than 6 months. This will bring back
into use many of the 550,000 private dwellings which now stand empty
because of controls, as well as making the provision of new rented housing a
more attractive investment.

And we will revise the housing benefit system to ensure that it prevents
landlords from increasing rents to unreasonable levels at the taxpayer's
expense.

All existing private and housing association tenants will continue to have
their present protection in respect of rents and security of tenure.

We will strengthen the law against harassment and unlawful eviction.
Rights for Council Tenants

Many council estates built in the sixties and seventies are badly designed,
vulnerable to crime and vandalism and in bad repair. In many areas, rent
arrears are high. In all, over 110,000 council dwellings stand empty. Yet it is
often difficult for tenants to move. If they are ever to enjoy the prospect of
independence, municipal monopoly must be replaced by choice in renting.

We will give groups of tenants the right to form tenant co-operatives,
owning and running their management and budget for themselves. They will
also have the right to ask other institutions to take over their housing.
Tenants who wish to remain with the local authority will be able to do so.

We will give each council house tenant individually the right to transfer the
ownership of his or her house to a housing association or other independent,

approved landlord.

In some areas more may be necessary. The success of Estate Action and
Housing Action Areas shows how a carefully targeted approach can

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

transform an area of poor housing and give people there new hope. Our
Urban Development Corporations have been successful in restoring derelict
industrial areas. We believe that a similar approach could be adopted for
housing in some places. We will take powers to create Housing Action
Trusts initially as a pilot scheme to take over such housing, renovate it, and
pass it on to different tenures and ownerships including housing
associations, tenant co-operatives, owner-occupiers or approved private
landlords.

We will reform the structure of local authority housing accounts so that
public funds are directed at the problems of repair and renovation;
maintenance and management are improved; resources are directed to the
areas where the problems are greatest; rent arrears are reduced; and fewer
houses are left empty.

Housing is the biggest single investment that most people make - whether in
money or in time, skill and effort. In the last eight years, as a result of our
policies, we have seen a dramatic increase in home-ownership. In the next
five years, we will complement that with policies designed to improve the
supply and condition of the rented housing stock.

A Capital-Owning Democracy
Share Ownership

Home-ownership leads naturally to other forms of financial provision for the
future - notably to pensions and share-ownership. Half of the working
population are in occupational pension schemes, but in 1979 only seven per
cent of the population held shares.

People were deterred by the sheer unfamiliarity of owning shares. Young
people were reluctant to save for a retirement which seemed far away. And
most tax incentives encouraged saving through institutions rather than
directly.

With a Conservative Government, all that has been changing. We were
determined to make share-ownership available to the whole nation. Just as
with cars, television sets, washing machines and foreign holidays, it would
no longer be a privilege of the few; it would become the expectation of the
many. We achieved this historic transformation in three ways:

First, we introduced major tax incentives for employee share-ownership.
Seven out of the last eight budgets have included measures to encourage
people to purchase shares in the company in which they work.

Second, starting this year, we brought in Personal Equity Plans, which
enable people to invest in British industry entirely free of tax.

Third, we embarked on a major programme of privatisation, insisting that
small investors and employees of the privatised companies should have a
fair chance to join in the buying.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

The results have been dramatic, and the direct consequence of government
policy. Share ownership has trebled. Almost one in five of the adult
population now own shares directly. And the figure will continue to rise. Of
this total, the majority are first-time shareholders and most of them own
shares in either privatised companies or the TSB group. One-and-a-half
million people hold shares in the companies where they work.

After eight years of Conservative Government, Britain is now at the
forefront of a world wide revolution in extending ownership. One in every
five British adults now owns shares compared to one in ten Frenchmen and
one in twenty Japanese. Only the Americans, where a quarter of the people
are shareholders, remain ahead - and the gap is narrowing.

This is the first stage of a profound and progressive social transformation -
popular capitalism. Owning a direct stake in industry not only enhances
personal independence; it also gives a heightened sense of involvement and
pride in British business. More realistic attitudes to profit and investment
take root. And the foundations of British economic achievement are further
strengthened.

We will press on with the encouragement of popular capitalism.
In the next Parliament:

e We will continue to extend share-ownership as we have done with
home-ownership.

e We will reintroduce our proposed tax incentives for profit-related pay.

e We will privatise more state industries in ways that increase share-
ownership, both for the employees and for the public at large.

Raising Standards in Education

Parents want schools to provide their children with the knowledge, training
and character that will fit them for today's world. They want them to be
taught basic educational skills. They want schools that will encourage moral
values: honesty, hard work and responsibility. And they should have the
right to choose those schools which do these things for their children.

Raising Standards in Our Schools

How can all this best be done? Resources obviously matter. This
Government has provided more resources for pupils than ever before.

With the Conservatives:

¢ Spending per primary pupil has risen by 17 per cent after allowing for
inflation and per secondary pupil by 20 per cent under our
Government.

e There are more teachers in proportion to pupils than ever before.

¢ British schools are world leaders in the use of computers in the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

classroom.

But money alone is not enough. Increased resources have not produced
uniformly higher standards. Parents and employers are rightly concerned
that not enough children master the basic skills, that some of what is taught
seems irrelevant to a good education and that standards of personal
discipline and aspirations are too low. In certain cases education is used for
political indoctrination and sexual propaganda. The time has now come for
school reform.

Four Major Reforms

First, we will establish a National Core Curriculum.

It is vital to ensure that all pupils between the ages of 5 to 16 study a basic
range of subjects - including maths, English and science. In each of these
basic subjects syllabuses will be published and attainment levels set so that
the progress of pupils can be assessed at around ages 7, 11 and 14, and in
preparation for the GCSE at 16. Parents, teachers and pupils will then know
how well each child is doing. We will consult widely among those
concerned on establishing the curriculum.

Second, within five years governing bodies and head teachers of all
secondary schools and many primary schools will be given control over their
own budgets.

They know best the needs of their school. With this independence they will
manage their resources and decide their priorities, covering the cost of
books, equipment, maintenance and staff. Several pilot schemes for financial
devolution to schools have already proved their worth, such as those in
Cambridgeshire and Solihull.

Third, we will increase parental choice.

The most consistent pressure for high standard in schools comes from
parents. They have a powerful incentive to ensure that their children receive
a good education. We have already done much through the 1980 and 1986
Education Acts so that parents can make their voice heard. But parents still
need better opportunities to send their children to the school of their choice.
That would be the best guarantee of higher standards. To achieve this:

We will ensure that Local Education Authorities (LEAs) set school budgets
in line with the number of pupils who will be attending each school.

Schools will be required to enrol children up to the school's physical
capacity instead of artificially restricting pupil numbers, as can happen
today. Popular schools, which have earned parental support by offering good
education, will then be able to expand beyond present pupil numbers.

These steps will compel schools to respond to the views of parents. But there
must also be variety of educational provision so that parents can better

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

compare one school with another.

We will therefore support the co-existence of a variety of schools -
comprehensive, grammar, secondary modern, voluntary controlled and
aided, independent, sixth form and tertiary colleges as well as the reasonable
rights of schools to retain their sixth forms, all of which will give parents
greater choice and lead to higher standards.

We will establish a pilot network of City Technology Colleges. Already two
have been announced and support for more has been pledged by industrial
sponsors.

We will expand the Assisted Places Scheme to 35,000. This highly
successful scheme has enabled 25,000 talented children from less-well-off
backgrounds to gain places at the 230 independent schools currently in the
scheme.

We will continue to defend the right to independent education as part of a
free society. It is under threat from all the other parties.

Fourth, we will allow state schools to opt out of LEA control.

If, in a particular school, parents and governing bodies wish to become
independent of the LEA, they will be given the choice to do so. Those
schools which opt out of LEA control will receive a full grant direct from the
Department of Education and Science. They would become independent
charitable trusts.

In the area covered by the Inner London Education Authority, where entire
borough councils wish to become independent of the LEA, they will be able
to submit proposals to the Secretary of State requesting permission to take
over the provision of education within their boundaries.

Village Schools

We recognise the important contribution made by small rural primary
schools to education and to the community life of our villages. We will
ensure, therefore, that the future of these schools is judged by wider factors
than merely the number of pupils attending them.

Pre-School Education

Eighty per cent of all three- and four-year-olds in this country attend nursery
classes, reception classes or playgroups. Formal nursery education is not
necessarily the most appropriate experience for children. Diversity of
provision is desirable. LEAs should look to support the voluntary sector
alongside their own provision.

A Better Career for Teachers

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We recognise the importance of teachers and wish to enhance their
professional status. The Government has provided a record amount of
money to increase their pay by an average 16.4 per cent this year 25 per cent
over 18 months. Our new pay award will encourage able young people to
enter the career of teaching and reward the many good teachers already in
the profession.

The Burnham negotiating machinery finally broke down and has been
temporarily replaced by an Interim Advisory Committee. The Government
wants an effective and permanent machinery for settling teachers' pay, in
which the interests of all parties will be recognised.

The Government will produce a Green Paper setting out the various
alternatives and will enter into wide consultations with a view to establishing
a new and effective machinery.

Higher and Further Education

The British system of higher education is among the best in the world. It
ranges from universities to further education colleges providing skills and
qualifications. We recognise the value of research and scholarship for their
own sake. At the same time we must meet the nation's demand for highly
qualified manpower to compete in international markets.

Building on our achievements since 1979 - 157,000 more full-time and part-
time students we want to expand higher education opportunities still further.
By 1990, we plan to increase student numbers by a further 50,000, and to
raise the proportion of 18-year-olds in higher education.

We will replace the University Grants Committee with an independent
statutory body on the lines recommended by the Croham Committee. The
new body will be called the Universities Funding Council (UFC) and will
have broadly equal numbers of academic and non-academic members with a
chairman who has substantial experience outside the academic world. The
primary responsibility of the UFC will be the allocation of funds to
individual universities under new contractual arrangements.

Polytechnics are today strong, successful and mature institutions. They are
complementary to the universities. Their present structure, under local
authorities, is inappropriate for an expanding national role.

As part of our policy to delegate power and responsibility, we will legislate
to convert the polytechnics and other mainly higher education colleges in
England to free-standing corporate bodies under boards of governors.

We will set up a new Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council
independent of central Government, in place of local authority control.

As part of our aim to widen access to higher education we have begun a

review of student support which is the most generous in the western world.
We need to modernise this system which has not changed for 25 years. The

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

purpose of the review is to improve the overall prospects of students so that
more are encouraged to enter higher education. No final conclusions have
been reached, but we believe that top-up loans to supplement grants are one
way, among others, of bringing in new finance to help students and relieve
pressure on their parents.

We will take care to ensure that the best aspects of the present system are
retained in any new proposals which we bring forward.

Trade Unions

It is not only in relation to government, however, that people's right to
choice and independence must be safeguarded and extended. Great social
institutions can sometimes become too powerful and cease to represent their
members, denying them any control over the decisions taken in their name
and even forcing them to act against their own interests. That was the case
with trade unions before 1979.

Since then, Conservative reforms have redressed the balance between the
individual and his union, preventing coercion of the majority by activists and
militants. These highly successful and popular measures have encouraged
democracy within the unions, restrained the abuses of secondary action and
picketing, reversed the growth of closed shops, restored the rights of redress
against unions acting unlawfully and removed the immunity of unions that
call a strike without a fair ballot.

The result has been a transformation of shopfloor relations, allowing
management and workforce to co-operate to improve working practices and
introduce new technology to mutual gain. In the next Parliament we will
protect the rights of individual trade union members.

We will introduce legislation to:

¢ empower individual members to stop their unions calling them out on
strike without first holding a secret ballot of members;

¢ protect individual members from disciplinary action if they refuse to
join a strike they disagree with;

¢ ensure that all members of trade union governing bodies are elected by
secret ballot at least once every five years;

¢ make independently supervised postal ballots compulsory for such
elections;

¢ limit further the abuse of the closed shop by providing protection
against unfair dismissal for all non-union employees, and removing
any legal immunity from industrial action to establish or enforce a
closed shop;

¢ provide new safeguards on the use of union funds;

¢ establish a new trade union commissioner with the power to help
individual trade unionists to enforce their fundamental rights.

Building Prosperity and Employment

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Since this Government took office in 1979, we have restored honest money
and established a stable economic framework in which business can flourish.
We have been careful not to spend money before we earned it. We have
brought the nation back to living within its means. We have massively
rebuilt our international assets. We have refused to be drawn into an auction
of pledges for higher spending that the country simply could not afford. We
have balanced the books. We have paid our way.

The results have been dramatic.

¢ Despite the coal strike and the collapse of the oil price, Britain has
moved from being bottom to the top of the growth league of major
European countries.

e Inflation has reached its lowest levels for almost 20 years.

¢ The basic rate of income tax has been cut from 33p to 27p, four taxes
have been abolished, and almost a million and a half people have been
taken out of income tax altogether.

¢ Over a million extra jobs have been created since 1983 more than in
the rest of the European Community put together.

¢ Unemployment, a problem throughout Europe, is now firmly on a
downward trend - with youth unemployment in this country below the
European average.

e We have rebuilt our net overseas assets to some £110 billion from a
mere £12 billion when we first took office. This will provide
substantial foreign earnings in the years ahead and a cushion, should
oil revenues fall.

While the Opposition parties cling to the failed policies of the past, our
strategy has become widely accepted abroad. Socialist Spain as well as
Christian Democratic Germany, Social Democratic Sweden as well as
France, Labour New Zealand and Conservative Canada, all accept that
governments must reduce their borrowing, curb state spending, reduce
taxation, privatise state firms and do away with unnecessary controls. What
we began in 1979 is today common international practice.

Stable Prices

Our greatest economic challenge on entering office was to defeat inflation.
Rampant inflation under the Labour Government, when money lost a quarter
of its value in a single year, had reduced our economy to ""the sick man of
Europe"".

Nothing erodes a country's competitive edge faster than inflation. Nothing so
undermines personal thrift and independence as to see the value of a
lifetime's savings eaten away in retirement through spiralling prices. And
nothing threatens the social fabric of a nation more than the conflicts and
divisiveness which inflation creates.

Our success in the battle against inflation has been the key to Britain's
economic revival. It required firm control of public expenditure, a

substantial reduction in government borrowing, curbing the growth of

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 14 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

money in circulation, maintaining financial discipline, stimulating
competition and moderating trade union power.

The Opposition parties opposed nearly every aspect of this strategy. If even
some of their policies were implemented today, higher borrowing and higher
spending would once again unleash inflation.

There is no better yardstick of a party's fitness to govern that its attitude to
inflation. Nothing is so politically immoral as a party that ignores that
yardstick.

The Conservative Government will continue to put the conquest of inflation
as our first objective. We will not be content until we have stable prices, with
inflation eradicated altogether.

Lower Taxes

We are the only Party that believes in lower taxation.

As the Party determined to achieve growing prosperity we recognise that it
is people who create wealth, not governments. Lower taxation coupled with
lower inflation makes everyone better off. It encourages people to work
harder, to be inventive and to take risks. It promotes a climate of enterprise
and initiative.

Lower tax on earnings enables people to build up savings to give them
financial security in later life.

Lower taxation, by increasing take-home pay without adding to industry's
costs, improves competitiveness and helps with jobs. And tax relief for
charitable donations encourages more people to give and to give more
generously.

There is a strong moral case for reducing taxation. High taxes deprive people
of their independence and make their choices for them. The desire to do
better for one's family is one of the strongest motives in human nature. As a
party committed to the family and opposed to the over-powerful State, we
want people to keep more of what they earn, and to have more freedom of
choice about what they do for themselves, their families and for others less
fortunate.

Governments should trust people to spend their own money sensibly and
decently; high taxation prevents them doing so.

That is why we have:

¢ cut the basic rate of tax from 33p to 27p in the £, and increased the
personal allowances (the starting point for paying tax) by 22 per cent
more than inflation.
If Labour's tax regime were still in force, the family man on average
earnings would today be paying more than £500 per year in extra

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 15 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

income tax: a headmaster married to a nurse would be paying more
than £1,300 extra;

¢ reduced sharply the absurd top rates of tax inherited from Labour
which were causing so many of our most talented people to work
abroad;

¢ increased greatly the tax relief for charitable donations. Giving to
charities has doubled since we first took office;

¢ abolished four taxes completely: the national insurance surcharge - the
tax which Labour put on jobs - the investment income surcharge, the
development land tax and the lifetime gifts tax;

¢ reformed and simplified corporation tax, and cut its rate to the lowest
of any major industrial country;

¢ cut the small business corporation tax rate by more than a third, and
extended it to many more small businesses;

¢ reformed and reduced capital taxes as well as slashing stamp duty.

In every case where taxes have been reformed and reduced there has been an
increase in the amount of tax collected.

Labour totally fail to understand the benefits this brings to everyone. Today
they openly threaten to raise taxation. To fulfil their plans, they would have
to raise taxes substantially. Indeed, all the Opposition parties Labour,
Liberals and SDP - would raise taxation. We believe that it is precisely the
wrong thing to do.

It will be our aim to do the opposite.
In the next Parliament:

e We aim to reduce the burden of taxation.

e In particular, we will cut income tax still further and reduce the basic
rate to 25p in the £ as soon as we prudently can.

e We will continue the process of tax reform.

Spending We Can Afford

Over the past eight years we have managed the nation's finances with care.
Even allowing for inflation, this has enabled us to spend substantially more
on the Health Service (up by 31 per cent), defence (up by 23 per cent), roads
(up by 17 per cent), education per pupil (up by 18 per cent), the police and
the battle against crime (up by 47 per cent), the disabled and long-term sick
(up by 72 per cent), and government training schemes (up by 120 per cent).

How have we been able to do this without running into the financial crises
which Labour's spending policies invariably set off?

First, we have been prudent with the nation's money. We have slashed public
borrowing and sought savings in government expenditure wherever they

could sensibly be found.

Second, we are engaged in steadily reducing the share of the nation's income

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

taken by the State. This means that more will be left for families and for
business to invest - the only safe route to higher growth in the economy.

Third, we have constantly improved the efficiency of the public services,
ensuring that we get more value for every pound spent.

For the next Parliament:

¢ Our aim is to ensure that public expenditure takes a steadily smaller
share of our national income.

¢ Within that objective, we will continue to spend more on our
priorities. We have set out our plans for further increased spending in
these areas over the next three years.

Creating New Jobs

High unemployment is one of the most intractable problems facing all
Western industrialised countries.

We understand the anxiety and stress which unemployment can cause. For
almost a year unemployment in the United Kingdom has fallen faster than
among any of our major competitors in Europe, and faster than at any time
since 1973. It is falling because of the growth and enterprise we have
achieved, assisted by the employment and training programmes we have
developed.

Since we were last re-elected in 1983, the number of jobs has risen by over 1
million more than in the rest of the European Community put together. This
Government has established the conditions in which business can prosper
and create new jobs. This has not just been achieved through the
revitalisation of traditional industries. We have encouraged growth in those
crucial areas of new enterprise which provide the foundation for the jobs of
the future - self-employment, small firms, the creation of new enterprise, the
expanding service sector - particularly tourism and leisure - and new
technology.

Self-employment is the seedcorn of the new enterprises of tomorrow. Without
sufficient people to start new businesses, the future of our whole economy is
in jeopardy. Today we have the highest number of self-employed for over 60
years. One worker in ten is now his own boss - or her own boss, since a
quarter of the self-employed are women. Indeed, the eighties have seen
almost three-quarters of a million people become self-employed. More and
more of our young people today seek self-employment as a worthwhile
career. It is particularly encouraging that almost half the growth in self-
employment since 1983 has been in the northern part of our country.

Small firms, along with all businesses, have benefited from our management
of the economy. Since this Government took office, the number of registered
businesses has shown a net increase of more than 500 a week - and the
number has increased in every region of the country.

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Helping Unemployed People into Jobs

As well as creating a climate in which business could employ more people,
we have developed programmes to help those out of work.

The Youth Training Scheme (YTS) caters for school-leavers aged 16 and | 7
who wish to participate in training and work experience. Every trainee is
given the opportunity of working towards a recognised qualification.

The new Job Training Scheme (JTS), which started in April this year, will
offer a chance to any person over 18 who has been unemployed for six
months or more, who wants to work and train with an employer for a
recognised qualification. This year it will help nearly a quarter of a million
people.

Under our Community Programme, each year over 300,000 people who have
been out of work for some time gain valuable experience working on
community projects. They have a reference to show potential employers.

We will improve the Community Programme to make it full-time and better
able to help those with families. We shall pay those working on the
programme an allowance giving a premium over and above their social
security payments.

Under the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, 230,000 unemployed people have
started to work for themselves. Many of them have now become employers
themselves.

JobClubs were first opened in 1985 to help the unemployed help themselves
back into jobs. Over 1,000 have been established. At present two-thirds of
those leaving JobClubs go into employment.

The JobClubs programme has been a great success. We aim to expand it.

Our economic success means that we can now do more to help those out of
work.

Although youth unemployment has declined in the last year it still remains a
problem. Far too many of our youngsters leave school with an education that
has failed to prepare them for the world of work. At the same time, by
maintaining high starting wages comparable to those of fully trained
craftsmen, trade unions have kept many of them out of work.

In 1983 we introduced the first Youth Training Scheme. It is now a national
two-year programme aimed at giving young people qualifications for work.

The First Guarantee

We will now guarantee a place on the Youth Training Scheme to every
school-leaver under 18 who is not going directly into a job.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 18 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

As a result, none of these school-leavers need be unemployed. They can
remain at school, move to college, get a job, or receive a guaranteed training.
YTS will serve as a bridge between school and work.

We will take steps to ensure that those under 18 who deliberately choose to
remain unemployed are not eligible for benefit. We will of course continue
to protect other young people, such as those who suffer from disabilities.

The Second Guarantee

There are still too many young people without the right qualifications for
employment in today's world.

Within a year we aim to guarantee a place, either on the Job Training
Scheme or on the Enterprise Allowance Scheme or in a JobClub, for
everyone aged between | 8 and 25 years who has been unemployed for
between six and twelve months.

The Third Guarantee

In addition to these major programmes we have taken one further important
step.

Restart is a programme we have set up for interviewing and counselling the
long-term unemployed to help them into a job or training. Everyone who has
been unemployed for more than one year has already been given an
interview.

We will guarantee to provide the Restart service in the future at six-monthly
intervals, to all those who have been unemployed for more than six months.

Over the next five years we will aim, through the Restart interviews, to offer
everyone who is under 50, and who has been unemployed for more than two
years, a place in the Job Training Scheme or in the new Community
Programme, in a JobClub or in the Enterprise Allowance Scheme.

Regional Assistance

Money spent on earlier programmes attracting firms to regions has
sometimes created very few jobs. Our new system of regional assistance,
introduced in 1984, ensures that aid is directly targeted towards the creation
of new jobs. New activities in the service sector from which so many of the
new jobs come have also been made eligible for assistance. Under the new
policy, offers of assistance have already been made which should secure
almost 300,000 jobs. We will continue to ensure that assistance is directed
where it is most needed.

The Employment and Training Services

We will take further steps to provide a comprehensive service to the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 19 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

unemployed. We will consult the Manpower Services Commission about
transferring JobCentres to the Department of Employment so that they can
work more closely with Unemployment Benefit Offices.

The Manpower Services Commission would then become primarily a
training agency. It is employers who are best equipped to assess their
training needs.

We will increase employer representation on the Commission and its
advisory bodies.

More jobs are being created by business and industry. Nothing would
destroy whole industries more effectively than a return to the overmanning
and restrictive practices of the 1970s. Our policies form a practical and
realistic approach to help people back into work. We will build on prosperity
to create more employment.

A Framework for Business and Industry

British business is in a healthier state than it has been for a generation.
Output has been rising steadily for six years. Productivity has increased at a
rate second only to Japan. Company profitability is at its highest for over
twenty years. Industry has a confidence in the future that would have been
unthinkable seven years ago.

Moreover, setting new records has not been confined to the private sector.
Since 1983 productivity in the coal industry has risen by over 50 per cent.
British Steel has more than doubled its productivity since 1979 and made a
profit last year for the first time in over ten years. British Rail will cost the
taxpayer 25 per cent less in subsidy this year than n 1983 and without any
major route closures.

The Conservative Government has created a framework in which once again
enterprise can flourish - by cutting red tape, by denationalising state-owned
companies, by removing unnecessary restrictions, by abolishing exchange
control, by enabling the City of London to become the foremost financial
centre in the world, by keeping down prices through extending competition,
and by ensuring access to open trade so that British exporters and
consumers can both benefit.

Privatisation

Over a third of the companies and industries which used to be owned by the
State have been returned to free enterprise. Productivity and profitability
have soared in the newly privatised companies.

¢ In 1980 Jaguar made 14,000 cars a year, losing well over £3,000 on
each Car sold. Now the company is hard put to keep up with overseas
demand and last year sold over 40,00 cars, making a pre-tax profit of
over £120m.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 20 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

¢ Since the National Freight Consortium was sold to management and
staff in 1982, pre-tax profits have increased sevenfold.

¢ British Aerospace, Cable & Wireless, Amersham International and
Associated British Ports have all strikingly increased their profits.

It is no mystery why privatisation has succeeded. The overwhelming
majority of employees have become shareholders in the newly privatised
companies. They want their companies to succeed. Their companies have
been released from the detailed controls of Whitehall and given more
freedom to manage their own affairs. And they have been exposed to the full
commercial disciplines of the customer. Even former monopolies now face
increased competition.

We will continue the successful programme of privatisation.

In particular, after the privatisation of the British Airports Authority we will
return to the public the Water Authorities, leaving certain functions to a new
National Rivers Authority.

Following the success of gas privatisation, with the benefits it brought to
employees and millions of consumers, we will bring forward proposals for
privatising the electricity industry subject to proper regulation.

Competition

Competition forces the economy to respond to the needs of the consumer. It
promotes efficiency, holds down costs, drives companies to innovate and
ensures that customers get the best possible value for money.

Accordingly, this Government has:

¢ deregulated long-distance coach services creating over 700 new
services with improved quality and lower fares;

¢ removed the monopoly on conveyancing of houses in England and
Wales;

¢ removed the opticians' monopoly, making it easier and cheaper to buy
spectacles;

e relaxed advertising controls on accountants, solicitors, stockbrokers
and vets, and permitted greater fee competition for architects and
surveyors;

* increased competition on air routes within the UK and between certain
European countries, which has resulted in cheaper fares, a more
responsive service and greater choice of carriers for the passenger;

¢ deregulated telecommunications, so that customers can now choose
between suppliers when buying telephones and private exchanges, and
business can choose between two alternative telecommunications
networks;

¢ suspended the Post Office monopoly of time-sensitive and valuable
mail, stimulating a dramatic increase in the number of private courier
companies.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 21 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We will continue this approach.

But competition must be supplemented by legal protection for consumers.
Those who make their living from their ideas and creations also require
protection against theft.

We will introduce further measures to impose tighter controls on pyramid
selling.

We will introduce measures to reform the law on copyright, design and
performance protection.

The City

The City of London is the world's leading market place in foreign exchange,
international bank lending and international insurance, It is a major source of
funds for British companies. The financial services sector as a whole
accounts for nearly 6 per cent of our national income, generates a net £7
billion per year to our balance of payments, and employs over one million
people.

Like other sections of British industry, however, the City was held back by
restrictive practices until they were swept away in last year's ""big bang"".
This has brought nearer the day when shares can be bought and sold over the
counter in every high street. We have also given building societies greater
freedom to make a wider range of financial services available to the average
family.

At the same time, the Conservative Government has introduced a legal
framework to protect investors and consumers:

¢ The Companies Acts of 1980 and 1981 strengthened the powers of
investigators and increased the courts' power to disqualify directors for
misconduct in the City as elsewhere.

¢ The Insolvency Act of 1985 made it easier to disqualify directors who
had been guilty of unlawful trading.

e And now the Financial Services Act of 1986 provides the first
comprehensive system of investor protection we have had in this
country. It also contains stringent new powers to investigate insider
dealing which was first made a criminal offence by the Conservative
Government in 1980.

The Conservative Party is the party of law and order. That applies just as
much to City fraud as to street crime.

Parliament has just approved our proposals for establishing a Serious Fraud
Office to improve the work of investigating and prosecuting the worst cases
of fraud and for streamlining court procedure. After the election we will
reintroduce our proposals to reform the outdated rules on evidence, as
recommended by the Roskill Committee.

Trade

Britain exports 30 per cent of all that it produces. If this country is to remain
a key trading nation, industry must remain competitive. That is one reason
why the Conservative Government attaches great value to maintaining an
open multinational trading system. Another is that increased trade is a major
way of encouraging growth and prosperity in the Third World. There is little
point in demanding more aid for these countries and then refusing them the
opportunity to trade.

We will continue to fight for free and fair trade in international negotiations
and resist the growth of protectionism.

We will press for international rules of fair trading to be extended to
international investment, trade in services and the protection of intellectual
property such as patents, trademarks and copyright.

We will continue to exert pressure on countries such as Japan to open up
their markets and provide the same freedom to trade for our exporters as
they expect us to provide for theirs.

As well as creating the commercial and legal framework in which industry
can flourish, the Government must also ensure that the practical services on
which industry and the citizen rely - transport, energy, research and
development, and an efficient civil service - are provided to a high standard.

Efficient Transport

The Conservative Government is proud of a record that has:

* modernised the transport system by investing over £10 billion in the
nation's motorways, roads, airports, seaports and railways;

* since 1979 completed over 680 miles of motorway and trunk roads
and 67 bypasses;

¢ secured greater efficiency by privatising British Airways, the National
Freight Corporation, Sealink and Associated British Ports;

¢ increased competition by deregulating long-distance coach services
and abolishing local bus licensing.

These measures have laid the foundations of an efficient and more flexible
transport system. We will develop it further along these lines. We are now
returning the nationalised bus companies to the private sector in many cases
to management buy-outs. We are also privatising the former British Airports
Authority the world's leading international airports group.

We are committed to a major capital investment programme through:
* new investment to build an extra 450 miles of motorway and trunk
roads to 1989/90;
¢ British Rail's plans to invest £500m a year over the next 3 years;

* private sector financing, construction and operation of the Dartford

Bridge and the Channel tunnel.
Energy

Britain is the only major Western industrial country that is a net exporter of
energy. This owes much to North Sea oil so successfully developed by free
enterprise. But it is an advantage that will not last indefinitely.

Coal will continue to meet much of the steadily rising demand for electricity.
Renewable sources of energy can make some contribution to the nation's
energy needs, which is why government-sponsored research has been
increased. Nevertheless, to reject, as our opponents do, the contribution of
nuclear energy to supplying reliable, low-cost electricity, and to depend on
coal alone, would be short-sighted and irresponsible.

The world's resources of fossil fuels will come under increasing strain during
the 21st century; so may the global environment if the build-up of carbon
dioxide the so-called ""greenhouse effect"" significantly raises temperatures
and changes climates.

After the most careful and painstaking independent assessment of the safety
case for a new pressurised water reactor at Sizewell, therefore, the
Government has decided to proceed with the next phase of our nuclear
programme. It is vital that we continue to give the highest priority to safety.
Our nuclear industry has a record of safety and technical excellence second
to none.

We intend to go on playing a leading role in the task of developing abundant,
low-cost supplies of nuclear electricity, and managing the associated waste
products.

Science and R & D

Government support for research and development amounts to more than
£44 billion per year. It is larger as a share of our national income than that
of the United States, Japan or Germany. A country of our size cannot afford
to do everything. These resources need to be better targeted. The task of
government is to support basic research and to contribute where business
cannot realistically be expected to carry all the risks.

We will ensure that government spending is firmly directed towards areas of
high national priority, by extending the role of the Advisory Council on
Applied Research and Development, drawing on the full range of advice
from the academic community and from business.

The Civil Service

We have long had in this country a professional and dedicated public service
which is the envy of the world. We are now building on those traditional
qualities which can too easily be taken for granted with new strengths and

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 24 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

skills: a greater readiness to adapt efficiently to change, including
technological change, to manage the public service more effectively, and to
see that the taxpayer gets value for money. The size of the Civil Service at
under 600,000 people today is the smallest since the war. This is already
saving the taxpayer £1 billion a year.

We will press on with long-term management reforms in order to improve
public services and reduce their cost.

Agriculture and the Rural Economy

Farming

Britain's farmers serve the nation well. They produce 80 per cent of the food
we grow compared with 60 per cent only 10 years ago. They have made us
into the world's sixth largest exporter of cereals when we had been a net
importer for decades before. They look after 80 per cent of the British
countryside. And consumer food prices have risen less than the cost of
living, unlike the Labour years.

But farmers world-wide are under pressure because of rising surpluses and
the huge costs of disposing of them. It is just as much in the farmers' interest
as in the consumers' and taxpayers' that this over-production be stopped and
a radical overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy achieved. Farmers
need a more sustainable environment in which to plan ahead.

We will continue:

¢ to play a leading part in European Community negotiations to reform
the CAP;

¢ to strive for even-handed and fair treatment between Member States
and between the different regions of the UK;

¢ to work for an early devaluation of the Green Pound, especially in
relation to beef; to uphold the interests of the efficient family farm;

¢ to reduce costs and tackle surpluses, by bringing supply and demand
in the Community

¢ into better balance by a combination of measures including price
restraint;

e to reduce the role for intervention, At home we will continue:

* to promote competitiveness and innovation in British farming and
horticulture;

* to give particular assistance to farmers in the Less Favoured Areas,
recently extended, where farming is difficult;

¢ to encourage better marketing of agricultural and horticultural
products and to ensure that the consumer has as much information
about the contents of food as is necessary to make sensible choices.

We will not introduce rating on agricultural land and will oppose two-tier

pricing in the CAP, which would greatly disadvantage our farmers and
benefit their competitors.

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

The Rural Economy

Farming is, and will remain, the major industry in the countryside and food
production will continue to be the farmer's basic purpose. The higher
production resulting from greater efficiency and modern techniques initially
means more land coming out of agriculture. A new balance of policies has to
be struck, with Jess support for expanding production of commodities
already in over-supply and more support for diversifying into other
activities.

We have recognised the new needs of the countryside and rural economies in
two ways. First, we now place more emphasis on support for the
environment and the beauty of the countryside; we now give grants to plant
hedgerows, not dig them up. Second, we encourage alternative uses of land
and more diverse job opportunities to maintain thriving communities in the
rural economy.

We will therefore:

¢ emphasise environmental protection and promotion of non-farming
rural businesses in the planning system;

* continue to support the Development Commission in developing rural
enterprises;

¢ extend the Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme which makes
conservation a more integral part of farming;

* introduce new schemes to assist diversification of new enterprises on
farms;

* introduce a new Farm Woodland Scheme to assist alternative land use.

The UK Fishing Industry

Our fishing industry supplies two-thirds of the fish we eat. It is an important
source of jobs and income in many areas.

The Government's success in further improving the Common Fisheries
Policy has meant that international policing has been made more effective;
and increasingly stringent conservation measures have secured the future for
our fleets.

We will introduce legislation to ensure that UK quotas are reserved for UK
fishermen. We are pledged to measures to enable our fishermen to take full
advantage of all their opportunities and to improve and modernise their
boats.

Animal Welfare

The Conservatives have a proud record over the years of promoting animal
welfare. Most of the legislation was either initiated by Conservative
governments or introduced as Private Members' measures by Conservative
MPs when the Conservatives were in office.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 26 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Since 1979 we have:

¢ set up the Farm Animal Welfare Council which advises the
Government on the welfare of farm animals. We will continue to care
for them with the advice and guidance of the Farm Animal Welfare
Council;

¢ honoured our commitment to replace the 1876 legislation with the
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 - the most effective in
Europe. It imposes tight new controls on the use of animals for
experiments. The number of experiments has declined in each of the
last nine years, and we expect that decline to continue.

Better Health, Better Care

Achievements in Health

The health of the British people is steadily improving. Quite simply, we live
longer. Life expectancy has increased and infant mortality has declined.

Over the last eight years the Government has spent more on the Health
Service than any previous government, Labour or Conservative. In 1979, the
outgoing Labour Government planned to spend less than £8 billion on the
nation's health. This year, the Conservative Government will spend nearly
£21 billion. After allowing for inflation, that is an increase of almost a third.
This extra money has been spent wisely and well. The Health Service today
is treating more patients than ever before in its history.

Money is important, but the success of the NHS depends still more on the
dedication of the people working in it. There are over 75,000 more doctors,
dentists and nurses than in 1978. These extra staff have enabled the NHS to
treat 6 million more patient cases - in-patients, day cases, out-patients than
when we took office. Sometimes they work in very difficult conditions. That
is why the Government has reduced nurses' basic hours from 40 to 37 1/2
hours per week and increased their pay by 30 per cent after allowing for
inflation.

We will continue to improve the Health Service.

Future Tasks for the Health Service

Our policies rest on six principles:

First, we will give greater emphasis to the prevention of avoidable illness
and the promotion of good health to make the NHS more truly a health
service and not merely a sickness service.

Much progress has been made in the past eight years.

¢ The improvement of the maternity services has helped to reduce by a
third the death rate among babies in the weeks around birth.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 27 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

e The expansion of vaccination and immunisation has prevented illness
and death among children.

¢ Screening for cervical cancer has been improved and death rates from
the disease have fallen by almost 10 per cent in the past decade.

e We have already embarked on a major campaign to tackle the problem
of coronary heart disease.

¢ To fight AIDS, the Government has undertaken the biggest health
education campaign ever seen in this country one much admired
abroad and is fully supporting the Medical Research Council in a
special programme of research towards treatments and vaccines.

These are welcome advances.
In the next Parliament, we will build on this work by:

* completing the network of computerised 'call and recall' systems for
cervical cancer screening. and extending them to younger women;

¢ developing a national programme for breast cancer screening;

¢ backing the newly established and powerful Health Education
Authority.

Second, we will continue to show our support for the million people working
in the NHS, of whom half are nurses.

Nurses wanted the assurance that, without recourse to strike action, they
would receive fair treatment over pay. That is why we set up the independent
Nurses' Pay Review Body. After the latest award, we will have increased
nurses' pay by 30 per cent since 1979, after allowing for inflation. That
compares to the severe reduction of more than 20 per cent, which they
suffered under the last Labour Government.

Nurses also want a training and career structure which reinforces their
professionalism, rewards experience, and offers opportunities for managerial
responsibility without being removed to a distant desk. We share those
views, and will seek to further them. We are particularly keen to attract
experienced nurses back into the profession, and to encourage others to take
up nursing as a new career.

Hospital doctors and consultants, too, are a vital part of the Health Service.
We have already increased the number of consultant posts and we will
continue to work for improvements in the medical career structure.

The NHS could not function without ancillary services. Some of these
cleaning, catering, and laundry have been put out to competitive tender to
enable health authorities to select the best and most effective way of
providing these services. Savings are now approaching £100 million a year
and they have gone directly and immediately into better patient care.

We have undertaken consultation on the improvement of primary care. Our

aim is to develop the strength and flexibility of the services provided by
GPs, dentists, pharmacists, opticians and nurses who work in the community.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 28 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

There are particular problems affecting health care in inner cities. Doctors
and nurses there take on a particularly tough and difficult job. We shall
continue to look for new ways of helping them and improving health care,
especially primary care in the inner cities.

Our third principle is to modernise the whole framework of the health
service its hospitals, its clinics, its equipment.

In the face of economic collapse, the last Labour Government cut the
hospital building programme by a third. This Government has embarked on
the biggest building programme ever. It will cost £3 billion. In seven years
we have already carried through over 200 major building projects from start
to finish.

We will complete some 125 further major new building schemes in the next
three years, and get many more under way.

New hospitals, too, are being built in areas lacking the provision they need.
Old and inefficient Victorian buildings are being replaced with purpose-built
modern hospitals. Much modern medicine and surgery is better carried out in
the new larger hospitals, equipped with new medical technology. Wherever
possible, however, small old hospitals have found a new role as community
hospitals staffed by local GPs.

Fourth, elderly, disabled, mentally ill and mentally handicapped people,
should be cared for within the community whenever this is right for them.

In the past some people who should have been cared for in other ways have
remained in hospitals, sometimes for years. That is changing. The number of
children in long-stay hospitals for the mentally handicapped has fallen by
almost three-quarters. The number of adults in long-stay mental handicap
and mental illness hospitals has fallen by around 11,000.

This changing pattern has already brought a better life to many thousands of
people. It has the potential to do so for many thousands more. But we need
to examine carefully various alternatives to discover what is now best for
patients. We have set in hand the first ever full-scale review of community
care.

We will develop our policies in the light of its findings.
Our fifth principle is to strengthen management.

The NHS is a large and complex organisation. It needs good management. It
is not a business, but it must be run in a business-like way.

The reduction of waste and inefficiency has released hundreds of millions of
pounds for better patient care. The sale of property which the NHS no longer
needs - for example, because of new hospital developments is currently
raising £200 million a year for better health care.

We will continue to ensure that the Health Service is as efficient as possible.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 29 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

But good management is not just a matter of efficiency. We value enterprise
in the public service just as much as in the private sector. We will continue to
encourage district and regional managers to devise new ways of providing
better patient care.

Finally, the ultimate purpose of the Health Service is to serve the patient:
that principle is at the heart of the Government's policy.

The time some patients have to wait for treatment is the most widespread
concern in the NHS. The Government has given priority to reducing waiting
lists and times. We have set up a special £50 million two-year programme.
This year it will give treatment to over 100,000 people who are waiting for
operations. We have set targets for more hip operations for old people, and
more bone marrow transplants for children.

Putting patients first was the theme of our consultative document on primary
care. We want the patient to have more information about services available
from family doctors so that they can make a more informed choice.

Social Security - a Fair Deal for Those in Need

We are spending about £46 billion this year on social security benefits over
£800 a year for every man, woman and child in the country. Expenditure on
pensions and other benefits has risen by £13 billion on top of inflation, since
we came into office. Most of this, an extra £9 billion, has gone to provide
better standards of help and support to more elderly people, families with
children, disabled people and those suffering long-term illness. The other £4
billion has gone to help the unemployed. But we have done more than
provide extra resources massive as the increase has been.

For the first time for 40 years the Government has undertaken an overall
review of the social security system. The review showed a social security
system which was too complex and which too often did not provide help for
those most in need. The 1986 Social Security Act tackled these problems
and reformed the position so that the system is simpler to understand and to
run. It will be fairer in the way it directs help to those who need it most. And
it will be a system in which people can look forward to independence and
security in retirement.

Our policies for social security have four main aims.

First, to ensure that those in retirement have a secure standard of living
through state provision and their own pensions and savings.

This Government has honoured its pledges to the pensioner and more than
maintained the buying power of the state pension. Total spending on state
pensions and benefits for elderly people has risen by 29 per cent after
allowing for inflation.

We will continue to maintain the value of the state retirement pension.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 30 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

But retired people value their independence. They do not want to rely on the
State alone for their income nor, increasingly, are they doing so. We share
Beveridge's original goal of a good basic pension from the State, together
with a second income from occupational and personal pensions and savings.

Pensioners have benefited from our success against inflation. Almost three-
quarters of all pensioners have savings. Their income from these has grown
by over 7 per cent on average every year since 1979. Income from savings
fell by 3Y2 per cent every year under the last Labour Government, eaten
away by inflation.

Occupational pensions, pensioners' savings, social security benefits and the
state retirement pension have all increased. The total increase in income for
the average pensioner is more than double that achieved during the last
Labour Government.

We are now offering new opportunities for people to obtain additional
pensions from their jobs or their own savings. We have already improved the
treatment of those now retiring early and of the pension rights of people
changing jobs.

We wish to encourage the 10 million employees who do not yet have their
own occupational pension scheme to have a pension of their own. Every
employee should have the right to take out a personal pension, fully portable
from job to job. That is why we are extending favourable tax treatment from
employers' schemes to personal pensions.

As a result of these reforms, millions more people will have the opportunity
to take out additional pensions of their own.

In the next Parliament:

We will reintroduce measures to give substantial tax incentives to personal
pensions, and to enable members of occupational schemes to make
additional voluntary contributions to a pension plan that is completely
separate from their employers' schemes. These measures will further
increase choice for millions of employees.

Second, to bring more help to low income families.

Child benefit will continue to be paid as now, and direct to the mother.
Families on income support which replaces supplementary benefit will
benefit from the new family premium. In addition, we will introduce the new
family credit which will benefit twice as many low income families in work
as family income supplement. The new system will also help tackle both the
unemployment and the poverty traps.

Third, to improve the framework of benefits for disabled people.
Spending on benefits for disabled people and those suffering long-term
sickness has been increased by 72 per cent after inflation to £6 billion. The

amount spent on mobility allowances has been doubled, invalid care

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 31 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

allowance extended, the new severe disablement allowance introduced and
the invalidity trap abolished. The introduction of the new disablement
premiums will bring an extra £50 million per year to disabled people.

We are carrying out a major new survey of the needs of disabled people.
This will be completed next year.

Fourth, to reform the tangled web of income-related benefits which has
grown up piecemeal over forty years.

For the first time all the income-related benefits will be calculated in the
same way. Where people are working, the amount of benefit they get will
depend on their pay after tax and national insurance contributions. Thus
people will not be made worse off by taking a job and will not lose money
when their gross pay rises.

The new rules, which come into effect in April next year, will be easier for
claimants to understand and staff to run. In addition, our programme of
computerisation - the biggest programme ever in this country will help staff
to deliver benefits to all who are entitled to them quickly, accurately and
courteously.

Success in social policy depends on growth in national prosperity. Labour's
economic failure led to damaging cuts in health care and benefits. Our
increasing economic strength means that resources for care have grown and
are growing - with programmes better managed, better adapted to changing
demands, and better directed to those most in need.

Freedom, Law and Responsibility

Conservatives have always believed that a fundamental purpose of
government is to protect the security of the citizen under the rule of law.
There can be no half-heartedness, no opting out, in the fight against crime
and violence: all of us, not just the Government or the police, share a
responsibility to make safer our streets and homes.

The Fight Against Crime

We do not underrate the challenge. Crime has been rising steadily over the
years; not just in Britain but in most other countries, too. The origins of
crime lie deep in society: in families where parents do not support or control
their children; in schools where discipline is poor; and in the wider world
where violence is glamorised and traditional values are under attack.

Government alone cannot tackle such deep-rooted problems easily or
quickly. But Government must give a lead: by backing, not attacking the
police; by providing a tough legal framework for sentencing; by building the
prisons in which to place those who pose a threat to society - and by keeping
out of prison those who do not; and by encouraging local communities to
prevent crime and to help the police detect it. All this we have done; and we

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 32 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

will intensify these efforts.

e The manpower available to the police has been increased by 16,500
since 1979.

e We have given the police more powers to avert public disorder.

e We have encouraged tougher sentences for violent criminals. The
maximum penalties for trafficking in hard drugs and for attempted
rape have been raised to life imprisonment. The courts have been
empowered to strip drug traffickers of their profits.

e We have brought forward a number of reforms to help tackle child
abuse and make it more likely that offenders will be successfully
prosecuted.

e We have embarked on the biggest prison building and modernisation
programme this century and increased staff numbers by almost a fifth.

Care for the Innocent

At the same time we have extended protection for innocent people and for
the victims of crime.

e We have strengthened the safeguards against any abuse of police
power by setting up an independent police Complaints Authority,
providing for the tape-recording of police interviews and setting down
clear rules on the proper treatment of the individual citizen.

e We have given special priority to helping the victims of crime. Police
treatment of rape victims has been made more sensitive. More
criminals now pay compensation to their victims. We are providing
more money to help local Victim Support Schemes.

e We have launched a determined drive to improve the administration of
justice by providing for time limits by which the cases of those held in
custody must be heard. 58 more Circuit Judges have been appointed
and 43 court building projects have been completed.

Better Justice

The challenge before us remains great; but much has been done. The great
majority of those who commit serious crimes of violence are brought to
book. There are more police, better equipped to fight crime. Those who
commit serious crimes can now expect much tougher punishment.

Early in the new Parliament the Criminal Justice Bill will have to be
reintroduced. It will:

¢ enable child victims of physical and sexual abuse to give evidence by
a live video link n order to reduce the anguish which they would
otherwise face;

¢ raise to life imprisonment the penalty for carrying firearms while
committing a crime;

e tackle, by providing for reference to the Court of Appeal, the problem
of lenient sentences which undermine public confidence in the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 33 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

criminal justice system;

* give victims of crime a statutory right to compensation under the
Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme;

¢ build on our previous measures stripping drug traffickers of the
proceeds of their crimes and extend the same approach to other serious
crimes.

We have already signed an extradition treaty with the United States which
will make it more difficult for terrorists to escape British justice: now we
will reform our own law on extradition so as to make still more effective the
international war against crime.

Building on Strength

We will continue to put a high priority on the fight against crime, so that the
citizen can feel safe on the street or in his home.

We will:

¢ increase the number of police further to ensure a stronger police
presence on our streets, to combat crime and to protect the public;

¢ strengthen the law dealing with the sale and possession of offensive
weapons;

¢ maintain the operational independence of the police and resist pressure
from the Opposition parties to politicise the police by letting local
authorities decide policing priorities;

* continue our present prison building programme and achieve more
professional and efficient working practices in the prison service;

¢ institute a thorough review of the workings of the parole system.

Our approach in all these cases is strongly supported by the general public.
We will go further in drawing on that support by promoting crime
prevention. Already more than 29,000 Neighbourhood Watch Schemes have
sprung up since the last Election. We are committed to the success of this
popular anti-crime movement.

We will build on the support of the public by establishing a national
organisation to promote the best practices in local crime prevention
initiatives.

We will seek ways to strengthen the special constabulary.
Tackling Drug Abuse

We have taken the battle against drugs into every corner of the globe where
production or trafficking flourishes. We have more than doubled the number
of customs specialist drug investigators. We have strengthened the
effectiveness of the police in the fight against drug abuse. Traffickers can
now be sentenced to life imprisonment. They also stand to lose all the wealth
generated by their evil trade under the most far-reaching asset seizure
provisions anywhere in the world.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 34 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We have funded about 200 new drug treatment facilities. Our prevention
campaign, targeted on youngsters at risk, is encouraging a strong resistance
to hard drugs amongst teenagers.

The battle against drugs can and must be won. Already there are some signs
that the heroin problem may have passed its peak. The cocaine explosion has
never happened. It need never happen.

We will continue to make the defeat of the drug trade a key priority.
Immigration and Race Relations

Immigration for settlement is now at its lowest level since control of
Commonwealth immigration first began in 1962. Firm but fair immigration
controls are essential for harmonious and improving community relations.

We will tighten the existing law to ensure that the control over settlement
becomes even more effective.

We now require visas for visitors from the Indian sub-continent, Nigeria and
Ghana, both to protect genuine travellers and to guard against bogus visitors
seeking to settle here illegally. We are tackling the problem of those who
fraudulently pose as refugees and who seek to exploit Britain's long tradition
of giving refuse to the victims of persecution.

We want to see members of the ethnic minorities assuming positions of
leadership alongside their fellow citizens and accepting their full share of
responsibility. Racial discrimination is an injustice and can have no place in
a tolerant and civilised society. We are particularly concerned about racial
attacks. They require effective and sympathetic attention from the police and
we have ensured that increasingly they receive it.

Progress towards better community relations must be on a basis of equality.
Reverse discrimination is itself an injustice and if it were to be introduced it
would undermine the achievement and example of those who had risen on
their merits.

Immigrant communities have already shown that it is possible to play an
active and influential role in the mainstream of British life without losing
one's distinctive cultural traditions. We also want to see all ethnic minorities
participating fully in British culture. They will suffer permanent
disadvantage if they remain in linguistic and cultural ghettos.

Reforming the Law

Since the last election the Government has made a number of important
reforms of family law. These cover the law of maintenance and distribution
of property following divorce, measures to prevent the abduction of children
and the law of illegitimacy.

Particular laws which are not enforced or which are full of obvious

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

anomalies risk bringing the law itself into disrepute. Changing tastes also
require the reform of outdated laws which govern personal habits and
behaviour: such reform should where possible be on the basis of a wide
consensus.

The present laws on Sunday trading and licensing contain innumerable
anomalies. They are frequently flouted.

We will therefore look for an acceptable way forward to bring sense and
consistency to the law on Sunday trading.

And we will liberalise the laws on liquor licensing hours so as to increase
consumer choice, but we will also keep a sensible limit on late-night
opening.

We have already extended absent voting rights to new categories of electors.
In particular we have enfranchised British citizens who have lived abroad for
less than 5 years.

We propose to extend this eligibility.
Northern Ireland

The British people have shown their commitment to the people of Northern
Ireland in the common fight against terrorism, and in helping improve the
economic and social situation in the Province. We resolutely support the
security forces in their outstanding service to the whole community.

We are determined that terrorism will not succeed; that the vital principles of
democracy will be upheld; and that the people of Northern Ireland
themselves should determine their constitutional position.

We will maintain, against Socialist opposition, for as long as is necessary the
special powers which the police need throughout the UK to prevent
terrorism and bring terrorists to justice.

There will be no change in the present status of Northern Ireland as part of
the United Kingdom unless the people of Northern Ireland so wish it.

That is at the heart of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which was signed with the
Republic of Ireland in 1985. The Agreement offers reassurance to both sides
of the community that their identities and interests will be respected, and that
any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the
consent of a majority of the people of the Province. It commits both
governments to work together in the fight against terrorism.

We will continue to work within the Province for a devolved government in

which both communities can have confidence and will feel able to
participate.

Local Government and Inner Cities

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 36 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

The Conservative view of local government is that local people should look
after the interests of the local community which they were elected to serve,
maintaining and improving essential services at a price people can afford.
That is an honourable tradition of public service, still upheld by councillors
in most local authorities.

But the abuses of left-wing Labour councils have shocked the nation. The
Labour Party leadership pretends that this is a problem in only a few London
boroughs. The truth is that the far Left control town halls in many of our
cities.

The extremists have gained power in these areas partly because too few
ratepayers have an interest in voting for responsible councillors pursuing
sensible policies. Many people benefit from local services yet make little or
no contribution towards them: this throws too heavy a burden on too few
shoulders.

There is much else wrong with the present system of domestic rates. They
seem unfair and arbitrary. And companies are left with little protection
against huge rate rises levied by councils controlled by Labour, Liberals and
Social Democrats, which drive them out of business and destroy jobs.

We have acted to protect ratepayers' interests in a number of ways. The
wasteful and unnecessary tier of the GLC and metropolitan counties has
been eliminated - to the substantial benefit of ratepayers. Our rate-capping
legislation so bitterly opposed by the Labour, SDP and Liberal parties in
Parliament has protected ratepayers from huge rate increases. This year
alone, twenty councils will be rate-capped nineteen of them Labour and one
controlled by the Liberals and the SDP saving ratepayers several hundred
million pounds.

We will now tackle the roots of the problem. We will reform local
government finance to strengthen local democracy and accountability.

Local electors must be able to decide the level of service they want and how
much they are prepared to pay for it.

We will legislate in the first Session of the new Parliament to abolish the
unfair domestic rating system and replace rates with a fairer Community
Charge.

This will be a fixed rate charge for local services paid by those over the age
of 18, except the mentally ill and elderly people living in homes and
hospitals. The less-well-off and students will not have to pay the full charge
but everyone will be aware of the costs as well as the benefits of local
services. This should encourage people to take a greater interest in the
policies of their local council and in getting value for money. Business
ratepayers will pay a Unified Business Rate at a standard rate pegged to
inflation.

We will require local authorities to put out to tender a range of services,

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 37 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

including refuse collection, the cleaning of streets and buildings, vehicle
maintenance, catering and ground maintenance.

Ratepayers expect councils to provide their services as efficiently as
possible. Yet some local authorities steadfastly oppose private sector
companies tendering for services even though they could provide them more
cheaply and effectively. The independent Audit Commission has estimated
that some £500 million a year could be saved if all councils followed the
practices of the best sums which could be used to lower rates or improve
services.

The Widdicombe Report into the conduct of local authority business painted
a disturbing picture of the breakdown of democratic processes in a number
of councils. We will take action to strengthen democratic processes in local
authorities.

Inner Cities

The regeneration of the inner cities must be tackled. The growth in our
national prosperity in recent years has been founded on a rebirth of
enterprise. But in many of our inner cities the conditions for enterprise and
pride of ownership have been systematically extinguished by Socialist
councils. For the sake of those living in our inner cities we must remove the
barriers against private investment, jobs and prosperity which such councils
have erected.

We are setting up five new Urban Development Corporations which will
have the powers, resources and management structure to reclaim and
redevelop great tracts of derelict land: these new Corporations will follow
the model successfully applied in London Docklands and on Merseyside.

Our Unified Business Rate will ensure that companies and jobs are not
driven out of inner city areas by the high rates of profligate councils.

We have roughly doubled the resources to reclaim derelict land. We will
improve procedures to accelerate the process of bringing vacant and under-
used public sector land back into productive use.

We will build on the experience of Urban Development Corporations by
creating new mini-UDCs. These will operate on a smaller scale in areas
where there is clear economic potential but where the local authorities are
failing to tackle the problem.

Our Urban Programme provides a range of grants to help industry and local
councils undertake projects that will improve the environment and
encourage new investment.

We are helping to lead local action through our five City Action Teams,
sixteen Inner City Task Forces and the Inner City Partnerships. All of them
draw on government assistance and work with local business and local
people to promote enterprise, employment and training.

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

Great cities are built on the enterprise and vitality of the individuals who live
there. Our aim is to create a climate which encourages and harnesses that
energy in the interests of all.

A Better Society

Planning and the Environment

Conservatives are by instinct conservationists - committed to preserve all
that is best of our country's past. We are determined to maintain our national
heritage of countryside and architecture. Since taking office we have:

¢ more than doubled the area of specially protected Green Belt: we will
continue to defend it against unsuitable development;

¢ established new arrangements, backed with public funds, to make
farming more sensitive to wildlife and to conservation;

¢ completed the work of listing pre-war buildings which receive legal
protection and extended such protection to the best post-war buildings;

¢ established a new, powerful Pollution Inspectorate;

¢ passed new laws on the control of pesticides and implemented new
controls on the pollution of water;

¢ put in hand plans for cleaning up Britain's beaches, costing over £300
million over the next four years;

¢ more than doubled spending after allowing for inflation on countryside
and nature conservation since 1979;

¢ set in hand the establishment of the new Norfolk Broads Authority - a
major environmental initiative;

¢ established a huge programme, costing over £4,000 million, to clean
up the environment of the Mersey Basin by the early years of the next
century.

We are determined to maintain the Green Belt. We will protect the
countryside for its own sake and conserve its wildlife, while allowing for
those small scale and well planned developments which are needed to
provide jobs and keep country areas thriving.

Wherever possible we want to encourage large-scale developments to take
place on unused and neglected land in our towns and cities rather than in the
countryside. We want to improve on our performance in 1986 when nearly
half of all new development took place on reused land.

A Practical Agenda

Only the Conservatives have a serious costed agenda for further
environmental action for another five years of Government. We will:

¢ continue our £600 million programme of modifying power stations, to
combat acid rain;

¢ adopt improved standards, in concert with Europe, for reducing
pollution from cars. We have already reduced tax on lead-free petrol

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 39 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

and will encourage its wider use;

¢ introduce new laws on air pollution and dangerous wastes;

¢ double the funding for Environmentally Sensitive Areas;

* introduce new laws giving extra protection to the landscape of our
National Parks;

* encourage more small woodlands in lowland areas through new
grants;

¢ legislate to safeguard common land on the basis of the Common Land
Forum, and continue to protect public access to the countryside
through footpaths;

¢ support scientifically justified, international action to protect the
atmosphere and the sea from damage from pollutants;

¢ establish a National Rivers Authority to take over responsibilities for
ensuring strict safeguards against the pollution of rivers and water
courses and to pursue sound conservation policies. The water supply
and sewage functions of the water authorities will be transferred to the
private sector;

¢ set up safe facilities for disposing of radioactive waste from power
stations, hospitals and other sources: we have asked UK NIREX to
come forward with proposals for deep disposal.

The Arts

Our international reputation in the arts has never been higher. Tourists flock
to this country to enjoy the highest standards of theatre, music, artistic
excellence and our museums. Art centres have nearly doubled in number
since 1979. Attendances at theatres, concerts, cinemas and historic houses
have all risen significantly.

Under the Conservatives, spending on the arts has risen by 15 per cent since
1979 after allowing for inflation. Over the same period, the Arts Council
grant has risen from £61 million to nearly £139 million. And schemes like
the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme have pushed the value of such
sponsorship from £72 million to £25 million over the last decade.

In future years:

e We will maintain government support for the arts and continue to
encourage private support.

e We will make it a major objective to ensure that excellence in the arts
is available in all parts of the country.

e We will continue to safeguard our heritage, particularly through the
National Heritage Memorial Fund, created by this Government in
1980 to assist the preservation, maintenance and acquisition of items
of outstanding merit which might otherwise be lost to the nation.

e We will encourage our great national museums and galleries to make
the national treasures which they house more widely accessible.

Sport

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 40 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We have increased funding for the Sports Council from £15 million in
1978/79 to £37 million in 1987/88.

We will continue to work with the Council and, through our funding of the
Sports Council National Centres, we will encourage the pursuit of excellence
in our sports.

We want to encourage competitive sports through schools and clubs and we
strongly oppose any attempts to ban competitive sports in schools.

We will continue to encourage schools and colleges to open their facilities
for community use wherever possible to co-operate with other owners to
achieve public access to sport premises.

Football hooliganism has tarnished the good name of British sportsmanship.
We have acted to control the sale of alcohol at sports grounds. We have
enhanced police powers to stop and search at football grounds and we have
encouraged tougher sentencing of hooligans.

Broadcasting

Our objectives for broadcasting are to provide consumers with a wider range
of programmes, to encourage independent producers, and to preserve the
high standards which we have traditionally enjoyed in British broadcasting.

Vital decisions will need to be made in the next Parliament. We have already
published proposals for a less regulated and more diverse radio system. We
shall follow a policy of more competition, variety and innovation in our
domestic networks and encourage the export of British programmes to
international audiences and markets. The development of the broadcasting
industry will be allowed to occur, wherever possible, commercially.

We will therefore introduce a major new Broadcasting Bill in the new
Parliament. It will enable the broadcasters to take full advantage of the
opportunities presented by technological advances and to broaden the choice
of viewing and listening.

The broadcasters owe it to the lively talent in the independent sector to take
more programmes from them.

We will ensure that at least 25 per cent of programmes broadcast on both
ITV and BBC will be supplied by independent producers as soon as
possible.

The responsibility for enforcing broadcasting standards must rest with the
broadcasting authorities. The present Broadcasting Complaints Commission
has a relatively narrow remit. But there is deep public concern over the
display of sex and violence on television. We will therefore bring forward
proposals for stronger and more effective arrangements to reflect that
concern.

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We will remove the current exemption enjoyed by broadcasters under the
Obscene Publications Act 1959.

Britain and The World

Britain is once again giving a lead in world affairs. We are forthright in
support of freedom and justice. We stand up vigorously for Britain's interests
abroad. Our voice is heard with respect on the crucial issues of war and
peace, of finance and trade.

Defending the Nation

The first duty of government is the defence of the realm and the preservation
of peace. Nuclear weapons are vital to that task. In the 40 years since 1945,
more than 10 million people have died in wars around the globe. But there
has been peace in Europe.

Conventional weapons did not succeed in deterring war. But nuclear
weapons have prevented, not only nuclear war, but conventional war in
Europe as well. A strong defence policy has proved to be the most effective
peace policy.

Labour's policy is to give up Britain's independent nuclear deterrent without
asking anything in return. The Labour Party would require the United States
to withdraw its nuclear weapons from our soil and to close down NATO
nuclear bases in Britain. It would remove Britain altogether from the
protection of the United States' nuclear umbrella.

That policy would abandon the defence policy followed by every British
government, Labour or Conservative, since the Second World War. It would
expose us to nuclear blackmail from the vast Soviet armoury, to which we
would have no reply. It would inflict damage, perhaps fatal damage, on the
Atlantic Alliance on which we and Western Europe depend for our security.
It would strike at our relations with our most important ally, weakening the
American commitment to Europe's defences. It would, in short, be the
biggest victory for the Soviet Union in 40 years.

The defence policy of the Liberals and Social Democrats is muddled and
confused. They would cancel Trident and they have no clear idea of what to
put in its place. Their suggested replacements are much more expensive than
Trident, which costs only 3p in every £ of defence spending. None would be
available in time. None would provide equal security.

The Liberal and SDP defence policy would be one-sided disarmament by
default or inadvertence. The only difference between it and Labour policy is
a matter of timing. Labour would scrap Britain's deterrent immediately upon
entering office. The Liberals and Social Democrats would allow it to wither
on the vine.

Only the Conservative Party stands by the defence policy which every post-

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 42 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

war government has seen to be necessary and which has kept the peace of
Europe for more than a generation. We are not prepared to take risks with
Britain's security:

e We will stand fully by our obligations to our European and American
allies in NATO.

e We will retain our independent nuclear deterrent and modernise it with
Trident. Because of improvements in Soviet defences we need the
greater capability of Trident to retain the necessary deterrence which
Polaris gives. No amount of money spent on conventional defence
would ever buy us the same degree of deterrence.

e We will continue to increase the effectiveness of our conventional
forces, to provide them with the most modern equipment and to obtain
better value for money from the defence budget. We have already
increased defence spending by more than 20 per cent in real terms
since 1979 and restored the pay and conditions of our servicemen.

But we also want to see a world in which there are fewer nuclear weapons.
That is why Britain is at the forefront of arms control negotiations.

We strive with our allies to achieve balanced and verifiable agreements for:

¢ the elimination of medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe and
preferably world-wide;

¢ agreed constraints on shorter-range missiles;

e a50 per cent cut in strategic nuclear missiles;

¢ and a world-wide ban on chemical weapons.

Western strength and resolution are essential to achieve these aims. That is
why the Conservative Government deployed Cruise missiles. All the
Opposition parties - Labour, Liberals and SDP - voted against deployment in
the House of Commons. Yet it was the deployment of Cruise and Pershing
missiles which brought the Soviet Union back to the negotiating table. We
can look forward to an agreement this year which will, for the first time,
reduce the numbers of nuclear weapons.

With the Conservatives Britain is also taking the lead in working towards
greater trust and confidence between East and West, and to encourage
changes in the East, where disillusion with totalitarian Socialism grows
inexorably. The Prime Minister's historic visit to Moscow was a major
contribution to this. We shall welcome any move by the Soviet Union
towards respect for basic human rights. But we must not lower our guard.
Strong defence is still the surest foundation for building peace.

Europe Grows in Strength
This Government has taken Britain from the sidelines into the mainstream of
Europe. But being good Europeans does not prevent us from standing up for

British interests. The agreement we negotiated on the Community Budget
has saved Britain £4,500 million since 1984.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 43 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We will continue to work for strict controls on the Community Budget.

Britain has led the way in establishing a genuine common market, with more
trade and services moving freely across national boundaries.

We will campaign for the opening of the market in financial and other
services and the extension of cheaper air fares in Europe.

We will also continue to work with our European partners to defend our own
trading interests and press for freer trade among all nations.

All of this will help safeguard existing jobs and create new ones.

We will continue to play a responsible leading role in the development of the
Community, while safeguarding our essential national interests.

Firm Against Terrorism and Aggression

Britain has stood at the forefront in the fight against international terrorism.
No democracy has a better record than Britain in standing up to the
terrorists, who threaten the most basic values of civilised life.

We will seek the support of other democratic nations for the provisions of
the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.

We stood up to aggression in the Falklands and would do so again, if
necessary. We want normal relations with Argentina. We have made
numerous proposals to that end. But we stand by our pledges to the
Islanders. We will not negotiate on the sovereignty of the Falklands.

The Wider World

When other countries are prepared to act in good faith, the Conservative
Government has shown the will and the diplomatic skill to find solutions to
age-old conflicts and misunderstandings. Our record of tackling long-
standing problems in Hong Kong, Zimbabwe and Gibraltar demonstrates our
determination to seek peaceful and imaginative settlements of difficult
international disputes. We have played a prominent part in bringing Israel
and the moderate Arab states closer to peace negotiations in the framework
of an international conference.

We believe that the issues of Southern Africa, too, will be tackled best by
dialogue, not violence. We want to see an end to apartheid in South Africa.
But trade and economic sanctions would only serve to entrench apartheid,
increase the risk of bloodshed and inflict severe hardship on black South
Africans without bringing a settlement any nearer. Negotiations between the
leaders of the South African people are the best way to resolve the problems
of that unhappy country.

Overseas Aid

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 44 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We have the sixth largest aid programme in the western world, and the third
largest in Europe, spending about £1,300 million each year. Britain
pioneered the reform of Europe's food aid policy, to make it more rapid and
effective. We have substantially increased our support for the disaster,
famine and refugee relief activities of voluntary agencies, as well as for their
long-term development work. We have led the way in giving help to the
people of Ethiopia, ravaged by famine. Our ""Aid and Trade Provision"" funds
have helped win good development contracts for British firms worth over £2
billion since 1979.

We will maintain our substantial aid programme and direct it ever more
effectively.

We will bring more young people from Commonwealth and other countries
to train and study in Britain.

We ourselves have made positive and practical proposals for international
action to help some of the poorest and most indebted countries of sub-
Saharan Africa.

Labour's proposal of selective import controls would damage developing
countries, open the door to protectionism and harm those poorest countries
which most need our help. It would also be bad for Britain. The best
contribution Britain can make to developing countries is to champion open
trade and free enterprise abroad and to practise them at home.

A Fateful Choice

For decades there was basic agreement between political parties on defence
and foreign policy. That agreement was firmly in the national interest. It has
been torn up by our opponents.

Labour's policy would mean not a secure Britain, but a neutralist Britain.
And eventually for there can be no trifling with Soviet power a frightened

and fellow-travelling Britain.

The Liberals and Social Democrats would take us more slowly down that
same disastrous road.

This election matters more for our safety and freedom than any election
since the Second World War.

Conclusion: The Way Forward

The proposals outlined in this manifesto are the extension of policies which
have already proved outstandingly successful.

Today Britain is a stable and well-governed country which exercises great
influence in the world.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1987/1987-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 45 of 46

1987 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:38

We seek the support of the British people to make this achievement truly
secure, to build upon it and to extend its benefits to all.

No previous government with eight years of office to its credit has ever
presented the electorate with such a full programme of radical reform.

No other party, presenting its manifesto proposals to the nation, has been
able to support them with such a solid record of achievement.

We commend them with confidence to the British people.

1983 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

Foreward - The Challenge of Our Times

In the last four years, Britain has recovered her confidence and self-respect.
We have regained the regard and admiration of other nations. We are seen
today as a people with integrity, resolve and the will to succeed.

This Manifesto describes the achievements of four years of Conservative
government and sets out our plans for our second term.

The choice before the nation is stark: either to continue our present steadfast
progress towards recovery, or to follow policies more extreme and more
damaging than those ever put forward by any previous Opposition.

We face three challenges: the defence of our country, the employment of our
people, and the prosperity of our economy.

How to defend Britain's traditional liberties and distinctive way of life is the
most vital decision that faces the people at this election.

We have enjoyed peace and security for thirty-eight years - peace with
freedom and justice. We dare not put that security at risk.

Every thinking man and woman wants to get rid of nuclear weapons. To do
that we must negotiate patiently from a position of strength, not abandon
ours in advance.

The universal problem of our time, and the most intractable, is
unemployment.

The answer is not bogus social contracts and government overspending.
Both, in the end, destroy jobs. The only way to a lasting reduction in
unemployment is to make the right products at the right prices, supported by
good services. The Government's role is to keep inflation down and offer
real incentives for enterprise. As we win back customers, so we win back
jobs.

We have a duty to protect the most vulnerable members of our society, many
of whom contributed to the heritage we now enjoy. We are proud of the way
we have shielded the pensioner and the National Health Service from the
recession.

Only if we create wealth can we continue to do justice to the old and the sick

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

and the disabled. It is economic success which will provide the surest
guarantee of help for those who need it most.

Our history is the story of a free people - a great chain of people stretching
back into the past and forward into the future.

All are linked by a common belief in freedom, and in Britain's greatness. All
are aware of their own responsibility to contribute to both.

Our past is witness to their enduring courage, honesty and flair, and to their
ability to change and create. Our future will be shaped by those same
qualities.

The task we face is formidable. Together, we have achieved much over the
past four years. I believe it is now right to ask for a new mandate to meet the
challenge of our times.

Margaret Thatcher

The Road to Recovery

Britain is once more a force to be reckoned with. Formidable difficulties
remain to be overcome. But after four years of Conservative government,
national recovery has begun.

When we came to office in May 1979, our country was suffering both from
an economic crisis and a crisis of morale. British industry was
uncompetitive, over-taxed, over-regulated and over-manned. The British
economy was plagued by inflation. After only a brief artificial pause, it was
back into double figures. This country was drifting further and further
behind its neighbours. Defeatism was in the air.

We did not disguise the fact that putting Britain right would be an extremely
difficult task. The second sharp oil price increase and the deepest world
recession since the 1 930s have made those difficulties worse. At the same
time, the Western world is passing through another transformation from the
age of the smokestack to the era of the microchip. Traditional industries are
being transformed by the new technologies. These changes have led to a
rapid rise in unemployment in almost every Western country.

Our opponents claim that they could abolish unemployment by printing or
borrowing thousands of millions of pounds. This is a cruel deceit. Their
plans would immediately unleash a far more savage economic crisis than
their last; a crisis which would, very soon, bring more unemployment in its
wake.

The truth is that unemployment, in Britain as in other countries, can be
checked and then reduced only by steadily and patiently rebuilding the
economy so that it produces the goods and services which people want to
buy, at prices they can afford.

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

What We Have Achieved

This is the task to which we have steadfastly applied ourselves with
gradually increasing success. Prices are rising more slowly now than at any
time for fifteen years. Britain is now among the low-inflation nations of the
Western world. Output is rising.

We are creating the conditions in which trade and industry can prosper. We
have swept away controls on wages, prices, dividends, foreign exchange,
hire purchase, and office and factory building.

We have returned to free enterprise many state firms, in order to provide
better service to the customer and save taxpayers' money.

We have cut income tax rates and raised allowances at all levels.

We have more than protected pensions against rising prices. We have
strengthened the National Health Service. We have given council tenants the
right to buy their own homes.

We have strengthened the police and the armed forces of the Crown.

We have done all this and more, and still kept our promise to bring public
spending under control.

We have paid off nearly half the overseas debts the Labour Party left behind.
Once the IMF's biggest borrower, we are now playing a leading part in
strengthening international trade and finance - to the benefit of the poorest
countries on earth.

And we have acted so that people might live in freedom and justice. The
bravery, skill and determination with which Britain's task force recaptured
the Falklands reverberated around the world. Many small nations gave
thanks for that stand; and our allies in the North Atlantic are heartened by
what Britain achieved in the South Atlantic.

Over the past four years, this country has recaptured much of her old pride.
We now have five great tasks for the future. They are:

* to create an economy which provides stable prices, lasting prosperity
and employment for our people;

¢ to build a responsible society which protects the weak but also allows
the family and the individual to flourish;

¢ to uphold Parliamentary democracy and strengthen the rule of law;

¢ to improve the quality of life in our cities and countryside;

¢ to defend Britain's freedom, to keep faith with our allies in Europe and
in NATO, and to keep the peace with justice.

These tasks will require sustained determination, imagination and effort
from Government and people alike.

Jobs, Prices and Unions

During the years of recession, now coming to an end, even the most
successful of our competitors have faced increasingly serious problems and
mounting unemployment. Despite all these difficulties, the Conservative
Government has been overcoming Britain's fundamental problems: restoring
sound money, setting a better balance between trade unions and the rest of
society, bringing efficiency to the nationalised industries, and developing
effective policies to mitigate the curse of unemployment.

The foundations of recovery have been firmly laid. In the next Parliament,
we shall build on this progress.

Success Against Inflation

Steadier prices and honest money are essential conditions for recovery.
Under the last Labour government, prices doubled and inflation soared to an
all-time peak - despite the existence of a battery of controls on prices,
profits, dividends and pay.

Today, there are no such controls. Yet prices are rising more slowly than at
any time since the 1 960s. During the last year, inflation has come down
faster in Britain than in any other major economy. With lower inflation,
businessmen, families, savers and pensioners can now begin at last to plan
and budget ahead with confidence.

In the next Parliament, we shall endeavour to bring inflation lower still. Our
ultimate goal should be a society with stable prices.

We shall maintain firm control of public spending and borrowing. If
Government borrows too much, interest rates rise, and so do mortgage
payments. Less spending by Government leaves more room to reduce taxes
on families and businesses.

We shall continue to set out a responsible financial strategy which will
gradually reduce the growth of money in circulation - and so go on bringing
inflation down.

Our opponents are once again proposing the same financial policies that led
to such appalling inflation and chaos in the past.

Labour's 'National Economic Assessment’ is a stale repeat of the Social
Contract which ended so disastrously in the Winter of Discontent. Once

again, the Labour Party is committed to carry out trade union leaders'
instructions in exchange for mere expressions of goodwill.

Commonsense in Pay Bargaining

With lower inflation. we have seen a return to commonsense in pay
bargaining. Uncertainty and anxiety about rising prices have contributed to

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

the absurdly high pay claims that destroyed so many jobs. As inflation
subsides, people in work can see the prospect of real, properly-earned
improvements in their living standards - which have gone up by more than 5
per cent on average over the last four years. So long as sensible government
policies are matched by sensible attitudes in industry and commerce, these
living standards can continue to improve.

The last four years have shown that a bureaucratic machine for controlling
wages and prices is quite unnecessary. It simply stores up trouble and breeds
inefficiency.

But Government remains inescapably responsible for controlling its own
costs. We are committed to fair and reasonable levels of pay for those who
work in the public services. We shall therefore continue to seek sensible
arrangements for determining pay in the Civil Service and the National
Health Service, following the Megaw Report and the resolution of the NHS
pay dispute.

It is equally our duty to the nation as a whole to prevent any abuse of
monopoly power or exploitation of the sick, the weak and the elderly. So we
must continue to resist unreasonable pay claims in the public sector.

Trade Union Reforms

In the return to more sensible pay bargaining, the trade unions have an
important part to play.

They can be powerful instruments for good or harm, to promote progress or
hinder change, to create new jobs or to destroy existing ones. All of us have
a vital interest in ensuring that this power is used democratically and
responsibly.

Both trade union members and the general public have welcomed the 1980
and 1982 Employment Acts, which restrain secondary picketing, encourage
secret ballots, curtail abuse of the closed shop, and restore rights of redress
against trade unions responsible for committing unlawful acts.

But some trade union leaders still abuse their power against the wishes of
their members and the interests of society. Our 1982 Green Paper,
Democracy in Trade Unions, points the way to give union members control
over their own unions. We shall given union members the right to:

¢ hold ballots for the election of governing bodies of trade unions;
¢ decide periodically whether their unions should have party political

funds.

We shall also curb the legal immunity of unions to call strikes without the
prior approval of those concerned through a fair and secret ballot.

Political Levy

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

Consultations on the Green Paper have confirmed that there is widespread
disquiet about how the right of individual trade union members not to pay
the political levy operates in practice, through the system of contracting-out.
We intend to invite the TUC to discuss the steps which the trade unions
themselves can take to ensure that individual members are freely and
effectively able to decide for themselves whether or not to pay the political
levy. In the event that the trade unions are not willing to take such steps, the
Government will be prepared to introduce measures to guarantee the free
and effective right of choice.

Essential Services

The proposal to curb immunity in the absence of pre-strike ballots will
reduce the risk of strikes in essential services. In addition, we shall consult
further about the need for industrial relations in specified essential services
to be governed by adequate procedure agreements, breach of which would
deprive industrial action of immunity. The nation is entitled to expect that
the operation of essential services should not be disrupted.

Involving Employees

Good employers involve their employees by consulting them and keeping
them fully informed. This is vital for efficiency as well as harmony in
industry. We shall continue to encourage it. Many employers have already
done much in recent years to establish a long-needed sense of common
purpose with their workforces. We shall resist current attempts to impose
rigid systems of employer/employee relations in Britain. We will continue to
encourage workers to identify with the success of the firm for which they
work, by the promotion of share-ownership and profit-sharing.

In each of the last two years, largely as a result of tax changes we have
introduced, about a quarter of a million employees have acquired shares in
the companies that employ them.

When state industries are offered to the private sector, we have given their
employees the chance to buy shares in them, and many have exercised this
right.

Unemployment: Coping with Change

During the last four years, unemployment in the industrialised countries has
risen more sharply than at any time since the 1930s. Britain has been no
exception. We have long been one of the least efficient and most over-
manned of industrialised nations. We raised our own pay far more, and our
output far less, than most of our competitors. Inevitably, this pushed prices
up and drove countless customers to buy from other countries, forcing
thousands of employers out of business and hundreds of thousands of
workers out of jobs.

At the same time, there has been a rapid shift of jobs from the old industries

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

to the new, concentrated on services and the new technologies. Tragically,
trade unions have often obstructed these changes. All too often this has
delayed and reduced the new and better-paid jobs which could replace those
that have been lost.

This Government has an impressive record in helping the unemployed who,
usually through no fault of their own, are paying the price of these past
errors.

We have committed over £2,000m. this year to training and special measures
for the unemployed. This is supported by substantial help from the European
Community's Social Fund, amounting to over £250m. in 1982. As long as
unemployment remains high, we shall maintain special measures of this
kind, which bring effective help to many of those who have no job.

This year, some 1,100,000 people are being trained or helped by the most
comprehensive programme of its kind in Europe.

For the first time, the new Enterprise Allowance Scheme offers many
thousands of unemployed people the support they need, but previously could
not get, while they start their own businesses. We will maintain special help
for the long-term unemployed through the Community Programme, and for
the older unemployed through early retirement schemes.

Removing the Barriers to Jobs

We shall go on reducing the barriers which discourage employers from
recruiting more staff, even when they want to. And we shall help to make the
job market more flexible and efficient so that more people can work part-
time if they wish, and find work more easily.

That is why we have amended the Employment Protection Act and why we
shall continue to:

¢ minimise the legal restrictions which discourage the creation of new
jobs;

* encourage moves towards greater flexibility in working practices, such

as Part-Time Job Release, which makes it financially possible for

people nearing retirement age to go part-time; and the Job-Splitting

Scheme which helps employers to split a whole-time job into two part-

time jobs;

improve the efficiency of the employment services in identifying and

filling job vacancies;

ensure that Wages Councils do not reduce job opportunities by forcing

workers to charge unrealistic pay rates, or employers to offer them.

Training

If we are to make the most of the employment opportunities that present
themselves in an age of rapid change and more varied patterns of work and
occupation, up-to-date training is essential.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

Training for work must start with better, more relevant education at school.
For school leavers, we have provided the most imaginative and far-reaching
scheme in our history. The Youth Training Scheme offers every 16-year old
a year of serious training for work. It should help 350,000 youngsters by the
autumn of this year. From now on, no one leaving school at 16 need be
unemployed in his first year out of school.

This is only a part of our wider strategy to ensure effective training for the
skills and jobs of tomorrow - on a scale and of a quality to match the world's
best. At its heart is our reform of industrial training and the apprenticeship
system.

We are improving the scope and quality of our training for the employed and
unemployed alike; tackling problems which the Labour Party has never had
the courage to face.

We shall continue to provide for, and improve, the special employment and
training needs of the disabled, and to reform our training agencies to meet
more effectively the needs of industry and workers alike.

The Nationalised Industries

Reform of the nationalised industries is central to economic recovery. Most
people who work in these industries work hard and have a sense of public
service. Since 1979, we have gone to great lengths to improve the
performance of the state sector, to appoint top-class managers and work
closely with them to tackle each industry's problems.

But for all this, few people can now believe that state ownership means
better service to the customer. The old illusions have melted away.
Nationalisation does not improve job satisfaction, job security or labour
relations - almost all the serious strikes in recent years have been in state
industries and services. We have also seen how the burden of financing the
state industries has kept taxes and government borrowing higher than they
need have been.

A company which has to satisfy its customers and compete to survive is
more likely to be efficient, alert to innovation, and genuinely accountable to
the public. That is why we have transferred to private ownership, in whole or
in part, Cable and Wireless, Associated British Ports, British Aerospace,
Britoil, British Rail Hotels, Amersham International, and the National
Freight Corporation. Many of their shares have been bought by their own
employees and managers, which is the truest public ownership of all.

We shall continue our programme to expose state-owned firms to real
competition. In telecommunications, we have licensed a new independent
network, Mercury, and have decided to license two mobile telephone
networks. We have allowed competition in commercial postal services.
Already, standards of service are beginning to improve. Investment is rising.
And better job opportunities are being opened up.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

We shall transfer more state-owned businesses to independent ownership.
Our aim is that British Telecom - where we will sell 51 per cent of the shares
to the private sector Rolls Royce, British Airways and substantial parts of
British Steel, of British Shipbuilders and of British Leyland, and as many as
possible of Britain's airports, shall become private sector companies. We also
aim to introduce substantial private capital into the National Bus Company.
As before, we will offer shares to all those who work in them.

We shall also transfer to the private sector the remaining state-owned oil
business - the British Gas Corporation's offshore oil interests.

We have abolished the Gas Corporation's statutory monopoly of the supply
of North Sea gas to industry. Already there has been a vigorous new lease of
life for gas exploration and development in the North Sea, which had ground
to a complete halt under Labour. In the last Parliament, we passed a law to
encourage the private generation of electricity. In the next Parliament, we
shall seek other means of increasing competition in, and attracting private
capital into, the gas and electricity industries.

Merely to replace state monopolies by private ones would be to waste an
historic opportunity. So we will take steps to ensure that these new firms do
not exploit their powerful positions to the detriment of consumers or their
competitors. Those nationalised industries which cannot be privatised or
organised as smaller and more efficient units will be given top-quality
management and required to work to clear guidelines.

Encouraging Free Enterprise

We want to see an economy in which firms, large and small, have every
incentive to expand by winning extra business and creating more jobs. This
Conservative Government has been both giving those incentives and
clearing away the obstacles to expansion: the high rates of tax on individuals
and businesses; the difficulties facing the small firm trying to grow, and the
self-employed man trying to set up on his own; the blockages in the planning
system; the bottlenecks on our roads; the restrictions on our farmers and
fishermen; and the resistance to new ideas and technologies.

In the last four years, many British firms have made splendid progress in
improving their competitiveness and profitability. But there is some way to
go yet before this country has regained that self-renewing capacity for
growth which once made her a great economic power, and will make her
great again.

Only a government which really works to promote free enterprise can
provide the right conditions for that dream to come true.

Lower and Simpler Taxes

In the last four years, we have made great strides in reducing and
simplifying taxes. We have:

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

e cut the basic rate of income tax; raised tax allowances above the level
we inherited after allowing for price rises; brought the higher rates of
income tax down to European levels; and made big reductions in the
investment income surcharge, which have particularly helped the old;

¢ removed many of the worst features of Capital Transfer Tax, Capital
Gains Tax and Development Land Tax;

* cut business taxes, in particular the National Insurance Surcharge,
Labour's tax on jobs, from 3% per cent to | per cent; and improved
stock relief for businesses;

¢ much reduced the taxes on, and increased the incentives for, gifts to
charities;

¢ greatly reduced tax bureaucracy. Manpower in the Inland Revenue and
Customs & Excise has fallen from 113,400 in April 1979 to 98,500 in
April 1983, and is set to fall further.

This dramatic progress is all the more striking when compared with the vast
increases in taxation which our opponents' policies would inevitably bring.

The changes to this year's Finance Act on which Labour have insisted show
that they intend just this. We shall reverse those changes at the earliest
opportunity.

Further improvements in allowances and lower rates of income tax remain a
high priority, together with measures to reduce the poverty and
unemployment traps.

We want to encourage wider ownership. This means lowering taxes on
capital and savings; encouraging individuals to invest directly in company
shares; and encouraging the creation of more employee share schemes.

More Small Firms

We have reduced the burdens on small firms, especially in employment
legislation and planning, and cut many of the taxes they pay, particularly
Corporation Tax. Our Loan Guarantee Scheme has already backed extra
lending of over £300m. to about 10,000 small firms. The new Business
Expansion Scheme, a major extension of the Business Start-up Scheme, will
encourage outside investment in small companies by special tax reliefs. The
construction of new premises for small businesses has more than doubled.

To help the engineering industry and the areas most dependent on it, we have
introduced and now extended a very successful scheme of grants (SEFIS) to
smaller firms, which help them to buy new machinery.

Thanks to these policies and over one hundred other important measures, the

climate for new and smaller businesses in the UK has been transformed and
is now as favourable as anywhere in the world.

Help for the New Technologies

Even during the recession, our new industries and technologies made

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

remarkable progress. Britain has more micro-computers in relation to its
population than any other country. We have speeded this progress by
supporting research and spreading knowledge of the technologies of
tomorrow; and by increasing government support for the new technologies
from £100m. in 1978-9 to over £350m. in 1983-4. But that is only the
beginning. We will now:

¢ promote, in partnership with industry, the Alvey programme for
research into advanced information technology;

¢ accelerate the transfer of technology from the university laboratory to
the market place, especially by the encouragement of science parks;

¢ help firms to launch new products through pilot schemes and public
purchasing;

¢ build on the successes of our 'Micros-in-Schools' scheme and our
network of Information Technology Centres for the young
unemployed so that they are equipped with tomorrow's skills;

¢ sanction the launch of new cable networks to bring wider choice to
consumers, not just for entertainment, but for the whole new world of
tele-shopping and tele-banking.

Regions, Enterprise Zones and Freeports

We shall continue to maintain an effective regional policy which is essential
to ease the process of change and encourage new businesses in areas which
have been dependent on declining industries. We do not propose sudden
changes in regional policy. But we will:

e make sure that these policies are economical and effective in creating
genuine jobs;

¢ secure more effective co-ordination between central and local
government and the European Community's Regional Development
Fund to ensure that their actions offer the greatest help to communities
in need;

¢ further develop local self-help initiatives, the 24 Enterprise Zones and,
our latest innovation, duty-free trading zones, which will be
established in certain experimental 'Freeports';

¢ diversify regional economies by encouraging the fullest use of our
schemes for innovation.

Planning

In our crowded country the planning system has to strike a delicate balance.
It must provide for the homes and workplaces we need. It must protect the
environment in which we live.

One particular way to achieve this is by bringing back into use the thousands
of acres lying derelict and unused, so much of which is in the ownership of
local authorities or other public bodies. We have set up Land Registers to
identify this land, and we shall now use our powers to bring it into use. The
more this land can be used, the less the need to build on Green Belts and the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

countryside. We will also bring open-cast coalmining within normal proper
planning control, and we shall establish more control over intensive
livestock units near residential areas.

Energy

Britain has come from nowhere to be the world's fifth largest oil producer.
The North Sea success story has been a triumph of private enterprise for the
nation's benefit. We shall continue to ensure that our taxation and licensing
policies encourage development in the North Sea.

In the next Parliament, the interests of the whole country require Britain's
massive coal industry, on which we depend for the overwhelming bulk of
our electricity generation, to return to economic viability.

We shall press ahead with the development of safe nuclear power. It is an
important way of securing lower-cost electricity for the future. We shall set
up an Energy Efficiency Office to co-ordinate the Government's
conservation effort, so as to ensure that the taxpayer gets the best value for
money.

We recognise that some energy users have special needs. This is why we
have:

¢ ensured that standing charges no longer dominate the bills of small gas
and electricity consumers;

¢ increased help for the needy with their fuel bills, leading to many
fewer disconnections;

and

¢ introduced more favourable terms for the energy-intensive industries.

Better Transport for Industry

The national motorway and trunk road network will continue to be
developed and improved to high-quality standards. This will not only make
driving much safer for all, but also speed and cheapen the transport of goods.
We will also seek to make rail freight more competitive.

Many of our ports have now been returned from state control to independent
ownership. We intend that they should provide profitable and efficient
services without the taxpayers' support.

Tourism
Our hotels, resorts and tourist attractions are important because they provide
hundreds of thousands of jobs, earn valuable foreign exchange, and provide

holidays for millions of our own people. We shall continue to support the
Tourist Boards and tourism projects throughout the country.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

Farming and Fishing

British farming and horticulture have improved dramatically since 1979.
Exports have leapt to £2,500m. a year. Since 1978, our self-sufficiency in
food has risen by more than a sixth, from 53 per cent to 62 per cent.

In Europe, our tough negotiating stance has doubled our farmers' share of the
help available under the Common Agricultural Policy. The cost of the CAP
to British taxpayers doubled under Labour. Under us, it has been falling in
real terms. We have reversed the Labour Government's disastrous policy for
the Green Pound which harmed British farmers. At the same time, we have
not neglected the consumers' interest. Food prices more than doubled under
Labour and rose faster than other prices. Under the Conservatives, they have
risen less than other prices. Last year they grew by less than one per cent, the
smallest rise for nearly twenty years.

We have given special help to Britain's hill farmers, and agreed very
worthwhile Community schemes for beef and sheepmeat. These have all
brought great benefits to Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the uplands
of England. We have launched successfully the 'Food from Britain'
campaign, which should help us sell far more of our products both at home
and in the rest of the Community.

We shall help the glasshouse industry to sell more fruit and vegetables, and
to make use of the best possible arrangements for heating and insulation.

We welcome the fact that, after long negotiations, the National Farmers'
Union and the Country Landowners' Association have agreed on the best
way to make more farm tenancies available for young people. We shall
legislate on these lines at an early opportunity. We intend to make sure that
British agriculture and horticulture continue to make the greatest possible
contribution to our economic success.

We have successfully negotiated a Common Fishing Agreement that
provides British fishermen with the greatest advantages in our waters in the
industry's history. For the first time since we joined the Community, we now
have effective conservation measures, and can look forward to expanding,
rather than declining, stocks of fish. During the next Parliament, we shall
introduce measures to restructure the fishing industry and to encourage
investment and better marketing.

Responsibility and The Family

Freedom and responsibility go together. The Conservative Party believes in
encouraging people to take responsibility for their own decisions. We shall
continue to return more choice to individuals and their families. That is the
way to increase personal freedom. It is also the way to improve standards in
the state services.

Conservatives believe equally strongly in the duty of Government to help

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

those who are least able to help themselves. We have more than carried out
our pledges to protect pensioners against price rises and to maintain
standards in the National Health Service. This rebuts the totally unfounded
charge that we want to ‘dismantle the Welfare State'. We are determined that
our public services should provide the best possible value both for people
they seek to help and for the taxpayer who pays the bill.

A free and independent society is one in which the ownership of property is
spread as widely as possible. A business which is partly or wholly owned by
its workers will have more pride in performance. Already firms like the
National Freight Company, where managers and workers joined together to
take over the business, are thriving.

Under this Government, the property-owning democracy is growing fast.
And the basic foundation of it is the family home.

Housing: Towards a Home-owning Democracy

We have given every council and New Town tenant the legal right to buy his
or her own home. Many Housing Association tenants have been granted the
same right, too. This is the biggest single step towards a home-owning
democracy ever taken. It is also the largest transfer of property from the
State to the individual. No less than half a million council houses and flats
were sold in the last Parliament to the people who live in them. By our
encouragement of private housebuilding and our new range of schemes to
help first-time buyers, there are a million more owner-occupiers today than
four years ago.

The Labour Party has met these proposals with vicious and prolonged
resistance and is still fighting a rearguard action against wider home
ownership. A Labour government would take away the tenant's right to buy
his council house, would prevent councils selling even voluntarily at a
discount, and would force any former tenant who wanted to sell his house to
sell it back to the council.

In the next Parliament, we will give many thousand more families the
chance to buy their homes. For public sector tenants, the present 'Right to
Buy' scheme will be improved and extended to include the right to buy
houses on leasehold land and the right to buy on a shared ownership basis.
The maximum discount will be increased by one per cent a year for those
who have been tenants for between twenty and thirty years, taking the
maximum discount to 60 per cent. We shall also help first-time buyers who
are not council tenants through our various low-cost home-ownership
schemes: 'homesteading', building for sale, improvement for sale, and shared
ownership.

Britain needs more homes to rent, too, in the private sector as well as the
public sector. For years, the blind prejudice of the Labour Party has cast a
political blight on privately rented housing. But our assured tenancy scheme
has encouraged builders to start building new homes to rent again, and our
shorthold scheme is helping the private sector to meet the needs of those

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 14 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

who want short-term rented accommodation.

We shall extend our Tenants' Charter to enable council tenants to get
necessary repairs done themselves and be reimbursed by their councils.
Housing Improvement Grants have been increased substantially in the last
two years and will continue to play an important role.

We shall conduct early public consultation of proposals which would enable
the building societies to play a fuller part in supporting the provision of new
housing and would bring up to date the laws which govern them.

Our goal is to make Britain the best housed nation in Europe.
Protecting the Pensioner

Over the last four years, the retirement pension has risen from £19.50 to
£32.85 a week for a single person and from £31.20 to £52.55 for a married
couple. Even after allowing for price rises, pensioners can buy more with
their pension today than they could under the last Labour government. We
have ended Labour's unreliable system of relying on forecasts of price rises
to decide by how much to increase the pension. In five of the last seven
years, those forecasts turned out to be wrong. In future, pensions will be
related to actual and not estimated price increases.

In the next Parliament, we shall continue to protect retirement pensions and
other linked long-term benefits against rising prices. Public sector pensioners
will also continue to be protected on the basis of realistic pension
contributions. In this Parliament, we raised to £57 a week the amount
pensioners may earn without losing any of their pension. It remains our
intention to continue raising the limit and to abolish this earnings rule as
soon as we can. The Christmas Bonus, which Labour failed to pay in 1975
and 1976, will continue to be paid every year in accordance with the law we
passed in 1979.

Over 11.5m. people - half the working population - are now covered by
occupational pension schemes. We will consider how the pension rights of
‘early leavers', people who change jobs, can be better protected and how
their members may be given fuller information about their pension schemes.

Social Security

Supplementary benefits, too, have been raised ahead of prices. To encourage
thrift, instead of penalising it, the Government has also raised the amount of
savings people can keep without losing any supplementary benefit. At the
same time, we have clamped down firmly on fraud and abuse of social
security.

Expenditure on cash benefits to the disabled is 21 per cent higher than under

Labour, even after allowing for rising prices. There has been extra help, too,
for those who are least able to afford their fuel bills.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 15 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

We have introduced - and extended - a widows' bereavement allowance. We
have kept the war widows' pension ahead of prices and removed it from tax
altogether.

Child benefit and one-parent benefit are to be raised in November to their
highest-ever level in real terms. We have also improved the family income
supplement scheme to help low-paid working families.

Our record shows the strength of our commitment. But our ability to help
depends on the wealth which the country produces. In Britain today, over
40p in every pound of public spending is already devoted to health and
social security. It is hypocritical for the Labour party to pretend that they
could raise public spending on benefits by thousands of millions of pounds
without admitting the vast increases in taxation and national insurance
contributions that would be needed, or the increased inflation that would
result.

The National Health Service

We have more than matched our pledge to maintain spending on the
National Health Service and secure proper value for money. Even after
allowing for price rises, the nation is spending substantially more on health,
and getting better health care.

By last year, there were 45,000 more nurses and midwives, and over 6,500
more doctors and dentists, working for the NHS than in 1978. This has
helped to make it possible to treat over two million more patients a year in
our hospitals. Until last year's futile strike, waiting lists for treatment fell
sharply.

We intend to continue to make sure that all patients receive the best possible
value for the money that is spent on the Health Service. The treatment of the
elderly, the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill will continue to make
extra provision for those parts of the country in the North and the Midlands
which have always been comparatively short of resources.

Unlike the last Labour government which actually cut the hospital building
programme by one-third, we have committed £1,100m. to our large-scale
programme for building new hospitals. There are now 140 new hospitals in
that programme being designed or built. We shall continue to upgrade
existing hospitals and brighten up shabby wards.

To release more money for looking after patients, we will reduce the costs of
administering the Health Service. We are asking health authorities to make
the maximum possible savings by putting services like laundry, catering and
hospital cleaning out to competitive tender. We are tightening up, too, on
management costs, and getting much firmer control of staff numbers.

Most people who are ill or frail would prefer to stay in or near their own

homes, rather than live in a hospital or institution. Helping people to stay in
familiar surroundings is the aim of our policy 'Care in the Community'. The

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

Government has given extra powers and extra cash to health authorities to
enable them to finance such community care for individual patients on a
long-term basis.

Partnership in Care

Conservatives reject Labour's contention that the State can and should do
everything.

We welcome the growth in private health insurance in recent years. This has
both made more health care available, and lightened the load on the NHS,
particularly for non-urgent operations. We shall continue to encourage this
valuable supplement to state care. We shall promote closer partnership
between the State and the private sectors in the exchange of facilities and of
ideas in the interests of all patients.

We also welcome the vital contribution made by voluntary organisations in
the social services. We shall continue to give them strong support. The
Conservative Government has already made many radical changes in law
and taxation which have greatly improved the way charities and voluntary
bodies are financed. The terms governing gifts under covenants have been
much improved, and the liability to capital taxation has been lightened or
swept away.

We shall continue to support our highly successful 'Opportunities for
Volunteering' scheme. In the next Parliament, we shall develop other new
ways to encourage more private giving.

Schools: The Pursuit of Excellence

For a long time now, parents have been worried about standards and
discipline in many of our schools. This Conservative Government has
responded to that worry with the Parents' Charter and the 1980 Education
Act. For the first time:

¢ local authorities were obliged to take account of parents' choice of
school for their children;

¢ schools were obliged to publish prospectuses, giving details of their
examination results;

* parents were given the right to be represented on school governing
bodies;

¢ the Government offered Assisted Places to enable less well-off parents
to send bright children to some of the best independent schools.

Giving parents more power is one of the most effective ways of raising
educational standards. We shall continue to seek ways of widening parental
choice and influence over their children's schooling.

We shall defend Church schools and independent schools alike against our
opponents' attacks. And we shall defend the right of parents to spend their
own money on educating their children.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

This country is now spending more per child in school than ever before,
even after allowing for price rises. As a result, the average number of
children per teacher is the lowest ever. Exactly how the money is spent, and
how schools are run, is up to local education authorities.

But the Government can help improve standards and make sure that children
are taught and trained for the world they will grow up into.

¢ Until now, HM Inspectors' reports have remained secret. Now we are
publishing them and making sure they are followed up, too.

e We are not satisfied with the selection or the training of our teachers.
Our White Paper sets out an important programme for improving
teacher training colleges.

e We shall switch the emphasis in the Education Welfare Service back to
school attendance, so as to reduce truancy.

e We have given special help for refresher courses for teachers, research
into special schools, and play groups and nursery schools where they
are most needed.

e We shall also encourage schools to keep proper records of their pupils’
achievements, buy more computers, and carry out external graded
tests. The public examination system will be improved, and O-level
standards will be maintained.

e We are setting up fourteen pilot projects to bring better technical
education to teenagers. The success of these will play a vital part in
raising technical training in Britain to the level of our best overseas
competitors.

Higher Education

Our universities and polytechnics, too, must generate new ideas and train the
skilled workforce of the next generation. We have unrivalled institutions and
unrivalled inventive genius - as the number of British Nobel prize-winners
shows. What matters is to bring the two closer together and make the best
practical use of both.

Britain has more students in professional training than Japan, and a greater
proportion of young people in higher education than France or West
Germany. More of our young people are now entering full-time degree
courses than under the last Labour government. And a larger proportion of
them complete their courses than in most other countries.

The very large sums of public money now going to higher education must be
spent in the most effective way. Within that budget, we want to see a shift
towards technological, scientific and engineering courses.

e We have set aside money for 700 new posts for young lecturers over
three years to bring new blood into research.

¢ Over the next three years, we will provide for more teaching and
research on information technology, with new posts for lecturers, and
2,200 new places for students.

Sport and Recreation

The Government has increased the real level of funding for the Sports
Council. The Urban Aid and Derelict Land Programmes have also
contributed to new sporting projects. By these means, and by offering one
pound of government money for every one pound raised locally, we have
begun to transform sports facilities in the inner cities.But there are still
plenty of sports facilities which could be opened up to the general public. In
particular, to reinforce our initiatives for better use of schools and playing
fields, we shall urge every local education authority to make school and
college premises available for use outside school hours and in the holidays.
In all these initiatives, voluntary bodies will be enabled to play a bigger part.

We have kept up the pressure for public access to parks and reservoirs for
anglers and all those who enjoy and respect the countryside.

Safety. Quality and Value For Money

The best way to protect the consumer is to bring price rises down and keep
them down, and to increase competition. We have achieved both, and so
helped the housewife far more than any bureaucratic system of controls. We
have also brought the state industries under the scrutiny of the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission, and exposed many of them to competition to
prevent them from exploiting their customers.

We shall remain vigilant in defence of the quality and safety of the products
people buy. But we shall also reduce government intervention wherever it is
unnecessary or harmful to the interests of the customer.

The provisions of our Data Protection Bill will meet public concern that
computers pose a particular threat to privacy, and will enable us to ratify the
European Convention on Data Protection.

Supporting Family Life

It is not for the Government to try to dictate how men and women should
organise their lives. Our approach is to help people and their families fulfil
their own aspirations in a rapidly changing world. As an employer, this
Government is fulfilling its commitment to equal opportunities for men and
women who work in the public services. We have brought forward for public
discussion proposals for improving the tax treatment of married women,
whether or not they go out to work.

We are reviewing the family jurisdiction of the courts, including their
conciliation role, with a view to improving the administration of family law.

We shall also reform the divorce laws to offer further protection to children,
and to secure fairer financial arrangements when a marriage ends.

Law, Democracy, and the Citizen

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 19 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

The rule of law matters deeply to every one of us. Any concession to the
thief, the thug or the terrorist undermines that principle which is the
foundation of all our liberties. That is why we have remained firm in the face
of the threats of hijackers and hunger strikers alike. The defeat of the
occupation of the Iranian Embassy is only one example of our determination
to be patient but still unyielding.

Backing the Crime-Fighters

We recognised from the start the immense and continuing public concern
about lawlessness, particularly in some of our larger cities. We acted
immediately to fulfil our pledges to give the hard-pressed police every
possible backing.

¢ The strength of the police force now stands at record levels: 9,000
extra policemen have been recruited in England and Wales alone since
1979. They are much better paid and equipped than ever before. We
shall be ready to increase police establishments where necessary in the
war against crime.

¢ Thousands more policemen are back on the beat, where the public
wishes to see them, instead of being isolated in panda cars. It takes
time for any reform in police training and methods to achieve its full
effect, but already street crime is being reduced and public confidence
improved in some of the worst inner-city areas.

e The proposals embodied in our Police and Criminal Evidence Bill will
help the police to bring criminals to justice. At the same time, they
will reinforce public support for the police by laying down clear rules
for the proper treatment of suspects. We shall also build more
courtrooms to reduce delays in trying criminal cases.

e Last year's Criminal Justice Act has given the courts tougher and more
flexible sentencing powers. This Act makes parents more responsible
for crimes committed by their children, and improves compensation
for the victims of crime.

¢ Courts will also continue to impose Community Service Orders which
compel offenders to make amends by doing useful work for the local
community. We shall set up more compulsory attendance centres to
which the courts can send young hooligans. The invaluable work of
the Probation Service will continue to be supported.

e There must be enough prison places to cope with sentences imposed
by the courts. We shall complete our major programme of building
which will provide another 4,800 places in ten new prisons. And we
are recruiting more prison officers to staff them.

e We will also respond to the increasing public concern over obscenity
and offences against public decency, which often have links with
serious crime. We propose to introduce specific legislation to deal with
the most serious of these problems, such as the dangerous spread of
violent and obscene video cassettes.

e We accept the case for an independent prosecution service, and will
consider how it might best be set up.

e We intend to extend substantially the grounds that disqualify those

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 20 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

with criminal records from serving on juries.

Dealing with crimes, civil disobedience, violent demonstrations and
pornography are not matters for the police alone. It is teachers and parents -
and television producers, too - who influence the moral standards of the next
generation. There must be close co-operation and understanding between the
police and the community they serve.

Immigration: Firm and Fair

We are utterly opposed to racial discrimination wherever it occurs, and we
are determined to see that there is real equality of opportunity. The
Conservative Party is, and always has been, strongly opposed to unfairness,
harassment and persecution, whether it be inspired by racial, religious or
ideological motives.

To have good community relations, we have to maintain effective
immigration control. Since 1979, immigration for settlement has dropped
sharply to the lowest level since control of immigration from the
Commonwealth began more than twenty years ago. By passing the British
Nationality Act, we have created a secure system of rights and a sound basis
for control in the future; and we will continue to pursue policies which are
strict but fair.

The Supremacy of Parliament

The British Constitution has outlasted most of the alternatives which have
been offered as replacements. It is because we stand firm for the supremacy
of Parliament that we are determined to keep its rules and procedures in
good repair.

We have modernised the Select Committees to improve Parliament's ability
to keep a check on the actions of the Executive. We shall continue to pursue
sensible, carefully considered reforms where they are of practical value.

Labour want to abolish the House of Lords. We will ensure that it has a
secure and effective future. A strong Second Chamber is a vital safeguard for
democracy and contributes to good government.

Northern Ireland

In Northern Ireland, building upon the courage, commitment and increasing
success of our security forces, we will give the highest priority to upholding
law and order. We will continue to give the support essential for the Province
to overcome its economic difficulties.

The people of Northern Ireland will continue to be offered a framework for
participation in local democracy and political progress through the
Assembly. There will be no change in Northern Ireland's constitutional
position in the United Kingdom without the consent of the majority of

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 21 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

people there, and no devolution of powers without widespread support
throughout the community. We believe that a close practical working
relationship between the United Kingdom and the Government of the
Republic can contribute to peace and stability in Northern Ireland without
threatening in any way the position of the majority community in the
Province.

The Quality of Government

This country is fortunate to have a Civil Service with high standards of
administration and integrity. The Civil Service has loyally and effectively
helped to carry through the far-reaching changes we have made to secure
greater economy, efficiency and better management in Government itself. It
is a tribute to this spirit of co-operation that the number of civil servants has
been reduced from 732,000 to 649,000 with the minimum of redundancies
and with higher standards of service to the citizen. This has saved the
taxpayer about £500m. a year, and is helping us to improve civil service
working conditions.

The efficiency 'scrutinies' launched by Lord Rayner and other money-saving
techniques have now identified savings worth £400m. a year to the taxpayer.
We have abolished 500 Quangos and done away with no less than 3,600
different types of government forms.

We are successfully putting out to tender more services needed by central
government. We shall press on with this wherever public money can be
saved and standards of service maintained or improved.

Public spending is now planned in terms of hard cash instead of so-called
constant prices, and the discipline of cash limits on spending has been
extended. As a result, public spending is firmly under control.

Local Government: Saving Ratepayers' Money

We have checked the relentless growth of local government spending, and
manpower is now back down to the level of 1974. The achievement of many
Conservative authorities in saving ratepayers' money by putting services like
refuse collection out to tender has played a major part in getting better value
for money and significantly reducing the level of rate increases. We shall
encourage every possible saving by this policy.

There are, however, a number of grossly extravagant Labour authorities
whose exorbitant rate demands have caused great distress both to businesses
and domestic ratepayers. We shall legislate to curb excessive and
irresponsible rate increases by high-spending councils, and to provide a
general scheme for limitation of rate increases for all local authorities to be
used if necessary.

In addition, for industry we will require local authorities to consult local
representatives of industry and commerce before setting their rates. We shall

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 22 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

give more businesses the right to pay by instalments. And we shall stop the
rating of empty industrial property.

The Metropolitan Councils and the Greater London Council have been
shown to be a wasteful and unnecessary tier of government. We shall abolish
them and return most of their functions to the boroughs and districts.
Services which need to be administered over a wider area - such as police
and fire, and education in inner London - will be run by joint boards of
borough or district representatives.

Improving Our Environment

The Conservative Party has a long record of practical and effective action to
improve the quality of life in our cities and countryside and to preserve our
heritage. Since 1979, no government in Western Europe has done more for
the environment - a clumsy word for many of the things that make life worth
living.

Reviving Britain's Cities

We have to cure the disastrous mistakes of decades of town-hall Socialism
by striking a better balance between public and private effort. Our approach
to reviving the rundown areas of our great cities is to use limited public
money to stimulate much larger investment by private enterprise. The £60m.
we have earmarked for the Urban Development Grant this year will be
matched by up to four times that sum from private firms investing in new
developments. On Merseyside, Operation Groundwork has brought together
landowners, local industry and local authorities to tackle the squalor and
dereliction on the edge of towns. The lessons of this and many other
Merseyside initiatives will now be applied in other urban areas.

We have encouraged people to move back into the inner cities. Builders are
now being helped to build homes of the type that young couples in particular
can afford. We shall promote this revival of our inner cities, both by new
building, and by sales by local councils of some of their rundown property to
homesteaders who will restore the homes themselves.

We shall encourage greater opportunity for all those who live in our inner
cities, including our ethnic minorities.

¢ Our small business schemes are helping to bring firms back into the
city centres, and the Enterprise Zones we have set up are already
bringing new life to some of the hardest-hit places in industrial
Britain.

e We shall continue to give priority to the areas most in need. Our
programme for the reclamation of derelict land will continue. We shall
increase our efforts to secure the disposal of under-used public sector
land, using the powers available to us in order to require sites to be
sold for homes and jobs.

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

Public Transport

We have already taken important steps to improve the standards of public
transport. We have lifted restrictions on long-distance coach services. As a
result, about one hundred new express coach services have been started,
fares have been substantially reduced and comfort improved. We shall
further relax bus licensing to permit a wider variety of services. We shall
encourage the creation of smaller units in place of the monolithic public
transport organisations which we have inherited from the Socialist past, and
encourage more flexible forms of public transport. City buses and
underground railways will still need reasonable levels of subsidy. But greater
efficiency and more private enterprise will help keep costs down.

The GLC has grossly mismanaged London Transport. We shall set up a new
London Regional Transport Authority for the underground, buses and
commuter trains in the London area. This will provide the opportunity to
split the different types of transport into separate operating bodies, put more
services out to private tender and offer the passenger better performance.

In the country, we shall ensure better use of school and special buses for
local communities. Restrictions on minibuses will be cut. So will the red
tape which makes it so difficult for small firms and voluntary bodies to
provide better ways to get around for those without cars, particularly the
very old and the disabled.

We want to see a high-quality, efficient railway service. That does not mean
simply providing ever-larger subsidies from the taxpayer. Nor, on the other
hand, does it mean embarking upon a programme of major route closures.
There is, however, scope for substantial cost reductions in British Rail which
are needed to justify investment in a modern and efficient railway.

Fewer restrictive practices and much more attention to the customer are also
essential. Rail services are now facing vigorous competition from coaches
and cars, and they need to respond with more innovative and more modern
work methods. We shall examine ways of decentralising BR and bringing in
private enterprise to serve railway customers.

To make life more agreeable in our towns and villages, we will push ahead
our bypass programme, which will help to take more lorries away from
them.

Rural Policy and Animal Welfare

Conservatives understand the need for a proper balance between the
strengthening of the rural economy and the preservation of the beauty and
habitat of our countryside.

Economic development will be encouraged in areas where this balance can
be best maintained. At the same time, we have introduced the Wildlife and
Countryside Act - the most important piece of legislation yet affecting the
countryside - to safeguard areas of natural beauty and sites of scientific

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 24 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

interest.

We have taken the lead in the much acclaimed measures to save the whale
from extinction and to protect seals, and we shall co-operate fully in the
important international work to protect all endangered species.

Since 1979, we have been working to achieve full European agreement on
the treatment of animals. We have introduced measures to improve the
conditions of farm animals being transported or exported. There is now a
European Convention on the Protection of Animals. We welcomed this
agreement, and immediately introduced a White Paper on Animal Welfare to
foreshadow changes in the law. We now propose to introduce legislation to
update the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 which will ensure more humane
treatment of laboratory animals in scientific and industrial research. The sale
of pet animals in street markets has been banned.

Controlling Pollution

We intend to remove lead from petrol, and are taking the initiative with our
European partners to achieve this at the earliest possible date. We will press
ahead with our plans to reduce lead in paints, food and drinking water.

We will continue our policy to reduce river pollution - the length of polluted
rivers has been halved in the last ten years, and this work will continue. We
shall tighten up the controls on the disposal of hazardous waste and continue
to support the movement for recycling and reclamation.

The worst problems of air pollution have been resolved. But in some areas
the levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide need to be further reduced.

The peaceful application of nuclear energy, if properly controlled (as it
always has been in this country), will be beneficial to the environment as
well as to the economy. We intend to make sure that the safety record of the
British nuclear industry continues to be second to none. The Sizewell
Inquiry into Britain's first Pressurised Water Reactor is well under way. The
project will go ahead only if both the independent inspector and the
Government are satisfied it is safe.

Arts and the Heritage

Despite the recession, this Government has strengthened its support for the
best of our heritage and for the performing arts. We have created the
National Heritage Memorial Fund, which fulfils the long-delayed wish to
commemorate the dead of two world wars in a permanent and tangible way.
We are building a new British Library. The new Commission for Ancient
Monuments and Historic Buildings will both safeguard our heritage and give
more people a chance to enjoy it. Under the Conservatives, Britain's opera,
theatre and ballet continue to win world-wide renown. And our tax changes
have helped to revive the British film industry. We shall keep up the level of
government support, including a fair share for the regions. We shall also

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 25 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

examine ways of using the tax system to encourage further growth in private
support for the arts and the heritage.

Britain in the World

For nearly four decades, Europe has been at peace. The strength of the
Western Alliance has kept our own freedoms secure. The possession of
nuclear weapons by both sides has been an effective deterrent to another war
in Europe.

The policies which our Labour opponents now propose would put at risk all
this hard-won security.

The Protection of Peace

The invasion of Afghanistan and the suppression of dissent in Poland remind
us of the true nature of the Soviet Union. It remains a threat to the liberty
and security of the West. The Soviet Union maintains massive armed forces
in Europe, and is extending its naval power throughout the world. Soviet
nuclear strength continues to grow, despite the false assurances of their
propaganda machine.

Labour's support for gestures of one-sided disarmament is reckless and
naive. There is no shred of evidence to suggest that the Soviet bloc would
follow such an example.

Labour would give up Britain's nuclear deterrent and prevent the United
States from using its bases in Britain which are part of its nuclear shield over
Europe. That would shatter the NATO Alliance, and put our safety in the
greatest jeopardy.

We will fully support the negotiations to reduce the deployment of nuclear
weapons. But we will not gamble with our defence.

The Soviet Union now has over one thousand SS20 warheads, two-thirds of
which are targeted on Europe. If the Soviet Union does not recognise over
the coming months the legitimate anxieties of the West by agreeing to our
proposals to eliminate this class of weapons, we will start deploying cruise
missiles by the end of this year. Even after this, the West will remain entirely
ready to negotiate for the removal of some or all of the missiles which we
deploy, on the basis of a balanced and fair agreement with the Soviet Union.

The Western Alliance can keep the peace only if we can convince any
potential aggressor that he would have to pay an unacceptable price. To do
so, NATO must have strong conventional forces backed by a nuclear
deterrent. And we in Britain must maintain our own independent nuclear
contribution to British and European defence. At the same time, we shall
continue to support all realistic efforts to reach balanced and verifiable
agreements with the Soviet Union on arms control and disarmament.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 26 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

We have substantially increased our defence expenditure in real terms. We
have honoured our promise to give our regular and reserve forces proper pay
and conditions and the equipment they need to do the job.

There could be no greater testimony to the professional dedication and the
quality of equipment of the British Armed Services than the brilliant
recapture of the Falkland Islands in just 74 days. We take pride in their
achievement.

Civil Defence

Our overriding desire and policy is to go on preserving peace.

However, no responsible government can simply assume that we shall never
be attacked. To plan for civil defence is a humanitarian duty - not only
against the possibility of nuclear, but also of conventional attack.

That is why we must take steps to provide the help that could be vital for
millions. To proclaim a nuclear-free zone, as some Labour councils have, is
a delusion.

The Conservative Government has accordingly carried out a thorough
review of civil defence, brought forward new regulations to require local
authorities to provide improved protection, strengthened the UK Warning
and Monitoring Organisations, and nearly doubled spending on civil
defence.

We propose to amend the Civil Defence Act 1948 to enable civil defence
funds to be used in safeguarding against peacetime emergencies as well as
against hostile attacks.

Britain in Europe

The creation of the European Community has been vital in cementing lasting
peace in Europe and ending centuries of hostility. We came to office
determined to make a success of British membership of the Community.
This we have done.

Our first priority in 1979 was to cut our financial contribution to the
Community Budget to a fairer level. Labour made a song and dance about
renegotiating the terms, but had achieved nothing. The bill to British
taxpayers soared.

We have stood up for Britain's interests, and substantially reduced our net
contribution to the Community Budget. We have tenaciously sought a
permanent alternative to the annual wrangles about refunds. Until we secure
a lasting solution, we shall make sure of proper interim safeguards for this
country. Meanwhile, with the help of Conservatives in the European
Parliament, we shall continue to try to shift the Community's spending
priorities away from agriculture and towards industrial, regional and other
policies which help Britain more.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1983/1983-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 27 of 30

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

We shall continue both to oppose petty acts of Brussels bureaucracy and to
seek the removal of unnecessary restrictions on the free movement of goods
and services between member states, with proper safeguards to guarantee
fair competition.

The Labour Party wants Britain to withdraw from the Community, because it
fears that Britain cannot compete inside and that it would be easier to build a
Socialist siege economy if we withdrew. The Liberals and the SDP appear to
want Britain to stay in but never to upset our partners by speaking up
forcefully. The Conservatives reject both extreme views.

The European Community is the world's largest trading group. It is by far
our most important export market. Withdrawal would be a catastrophe for
this country. As many as two million jobs would be at risk. We would lose
the great export advantages and the attraction to overseas investors which
membership now gives us. It would be a fateful step towards isolation, at
which only the Soviet Union and her allies would rejoice.

A Trading Nation

Our most important contribution to a healthy world economy is to manage
our own affairs successfully. We shall also build on our important role in
promoting international action to encourage recovery through the IMF and
other international organisations. With the other leading industrial nations,
we shall continue with our realistic initiatives to improve currency stability
in the Western world, and assist nations with excessive debts to regain
stability. Together with the Community, we are also playing a leading part in
preserving an open world trading system, while safeguarding our most
vulnerable industries.

While world trade declined last year, our exports and share of world trade
increased, and we enjoyed a healthy balance of payments surplus, despite the
pessimists who said the pound was uncompetitive. We believe in reinforcing
success. This Government has given wholehearted support to British
companies tendering for major overseas projects, and helped them secure
many important contracts in the face of the toughest competition.

We will build on these initiatives to help our exporters, and vigorously
promote the interests of British trade and industry in international
negotiations - where we have already made our presence very effectively
felt. We have no intention of becoming a dumping ground for the goods of
other nations. We shall continue to challenge other nations' unfair barriers,
whether in the shape of tariffs or trading practices.

Our Wider Role

In a troubled world, Britain is increasingly respected because we stand up
for our own interests. But we are also respected because we stand up for the
cause of freedom and the spread of prosperity throughout the world.

1983 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

We resisted unprovoked aggression in the Falkland Islands, when the loyal
support of our friends throughout the world reminded us of our common
heritage of freedom. We will continue to uphold the principles for which we
fought.

We shall continue to give our full support to the Commonwealth and to play
an active and constructive part at the United Nations.

Our generous but carefully controlled aid programme is both an investment
in the freedom and prosperity of the poorer countries and in a stable and
expanding world economy. That programme helps us as well as those who
receive it, since most of it is spent on British goods and services. More than
many other nations, we direct our aid to the poorest countries, particularly in
the Commonwealth.

But government aid is only a part of the total help we give the developing
world. Unlike the Labour Party, we believe in permitting a free and
profitable outflow of British investment. That flow to poorer countries has
now grown far larger than British Government aid, bringing with it an
invaluable transfer of skills and technology.

The Resolute Approach

This Government's approach is straightforward and resolute. We mean what
we say. We face the truth, even when it is painful. And we stick to our
purpose.

Most decisions worth taking are difficult. Cutting a clear path through the
jungle of a modern bureaucracy is hard going. The world recession of the
past four years, and the high level of unemployment throughout the
industrial world, have made the going harder.

During these difficult years, we have protected the sick and the elderly. We
have maintained Britain's defences and her contribution to the Western
Alliance. And at the same time, we have laid the foundations for a dynamic
and prosperous future.

The rewards are beginning to appear. If we continue on our present course
with courage and commonsense, those rewards should multiply in the next
five years.

We shall never lose sight of the British traditions of fairness and tolerance.
We are also determined to revive those other British qualities - a genius for
invention and a spirit of enterprise.

Under Conservative government, confidence is brushing aside pessimism at
home. Abroad, Britain is regarded for the first time in years as a country

with a great future as well as a great past.

We mean to make that future a reality.

1979 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

Foreword

FOR ME, THE HEART OF POLITICS is not political theory, it is people
and how they want to live their lives.

No one who has lived in this country during the last five years can fail to be
aware of how the balance of our society has been increasingly tilted in
favour of the State at the expense of individual freedom.

This election may be the last chance we have to reverse that process, to
restore the balance of power in favour of the people. It is therefore the most
crucial election since the war.

Together with the threat to freedom there has been a feeling of helplessness,
that we are a once great nation that has somehow fallen behind and that it is
too late now to turn things round.

I don't accept that. 1 believe we not only can, we must. This manifesto points
the way.

It contains no magic formula or lavish promises. It is not a recipe for an easy
or a perfect life. But it sets out a broad framework for the recovery of our
country, based not on dogma, but On reason, on common sense, above all on
the liberty of the people under the law.

The things we have in common as a nation far outnumber those that set us
apart.

It is in that spirit that I commend to you this manifesto.

Margaret Thatcher

I. Our five tasks

THIS ELECTION is about the future of Britain - a great country which
seems to have lost its way. It is a country rich in natural resources, in coal,
oil, gas and fertile farmlands. It is rich, too, in human resources, with
professional and managerial skills of the highest calibre, with great
industries and firms whose workers can be the equal of any in the world. We

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 21

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

are the inheritors of a long tradition of parliamentary democracy and the rule
of law.

Yet today, this country is faced with its most serious problems since the
Second World War. What has happened to our country, to the values we used
to share, to the success and prosperity we once took for granted?

During the industrial strife of last winter, confidence, self-respect, common
sense, and even our sense of common humanity were shaken. At times this
society seemed on the brink of disintegration.

Some of the reasons for our difficulties today are complex and go back many
years. Others are more simple and more recent. We do not lay all the blame
on the Labour Party: but Labour have been in power for most of the last
fifteen years and cannot escape the major responsibility.

They have made things worse in three ways. First, by practising the politics
of envy and by actively discouraging the creation of wealth, they have set
one group against another in an often bitter struggle to gain a larger share of
a weak economy.

Second, by enlarging the role of the State and diminishing the role of the
individual, they have crippled the enterprise and effort on which a
prosperous country with improving social services depends.

Third, by heaping privilege without responsibility on the trade unions,
Labour have given a minority of extremists the power to abuse individual
liberties and to thwart Britain's chances of success. One result is that the
trade union movement, which sprang from a deep and genuine fellow-
feeling for the brotherhood of man, is today more distrusted and feared than
ever before.

It is not just that Labour have governed Britain badly. They have reached a
dead-end. The very nature of their Party now prevents them from governing
successfully in a free society and mixed economy.

Divided against themselves; devoid of any policies except those which have
led to and would worsen our present troubles; bound inescapably by ties of
history, political dogma and financial dependence to a single powerful
interest group, Labour have demonstrated yet again that they cannot speak
and dare not act for the nation as a whole.

Our country's relative decline is not inevitable. We in the Conservative Party
think we can reverse it, not because we think we have all the answers but
because we think we have the one answer that matters most. We want to
work with the grain of human nature, helping people to help themselves -
and others. This is the way to restore that self-reliance and self-confidence
which are the basis of personal responsibility and national success.

Attempting to do too much, politicians have failed to do those things which
should be done. This has damaged the country and the authority of
government. We must concentrate on what should be the priorities for any

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 21

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

government. They are set out in this manifesto.

Those who look in these pages for lavish promises or detailed commitments
on every subject will look in vain. We may be able to do more in the next
five years than we indicate here. We believe we can. But the Conservative
government's first job will be to rebuild our economy and reunite a divided
and disillusioned people.

Our five tasks are:

1. To restore the health of our economic and social life, by controlling
inflation and striking a fair balance between the rights and duties of
the trade union movement.

2. To restore incentives so that hard work pays, success is rewarded and
genuine new jobs are created in an expanding economy.

3. To uphold Parliament and the rule of law.

4. To support family life, by helping people to become home-owners,
raising the standards of their children's education, and concentrating
welfare services on the effective support of the old, the sick, the
disabled and those who are in real need.

5. To strengthen Britain's defences and work with our allies to protect
our interests in an increasingly threatening world.

This is the strategy of the next Conservative government.

2. Restoring the balance

SOUND MONEY and a fair balance between the rights and obligations of
unions, management and the community in which they work are essential to
economic recovery. They should provide the stable conditions in which pay
bargaining can take place as responsibly in Britain as it does in other
countries.

The Control of Inflation

Under Labour prices have risen faster than at any peacetime period in the
three centuries in which records have been kept, and inflation is now
accelerating again. The pound today is worth less than half its 1974 value.
On present form it would be halved in value yet again within eight years.
Inflation on this scale has come near to destroying our political and social
stability.

To master inflation, proper monetary discipline is essential, with publicly
stated targets for the rate of growth of the money supply. At the same time, a
gradual reduction in the size of the Government's borrowing requirement is
also vital. This Government's price controls have done nothing to prevent
inflation, as is proved by the doubling of prices since they came to power.
All the controls have achieved is a loss of jobs and a reduction in consumer
choice.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 21

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

The State takes too much of the nation's income; its share must be steadily
reduced. When it spends and borrows too much, taxes, interest rates, prices
and unemployment rise so that in the long run there is less wealth with
which to improve Our standard of living and our social services.

Better Value for Money

Any future government which sets out honestly to reduce inflation and
taxation will have to make substantial economies, and there should be no
doubt about our intention to do so. We do not pretend that every saving can
be made without change or complaint; but if the Government does not
economise the sacrifices required of ordinary people will be all the greater.

Important savings can be made in several ways. We will scrap expensive
Socialist programmes, such as the nationalisation of building land. We shall
reduce government intervention in industry and particularly that of the
National Enterprise Board, whose borrowing powers are planned to reach
£45 billion. We shall ensure that selective assistance to industry is not
wasted, as it was in the case of Labour's assistance to certain oil platform
yards, on which over £20 million of public money was spent but no orders
received.

The reduction of waste, bureaucracy and over-government will also yield
substantial savings. For example, we shall look for economies in the cost
(about £1.2 billion) of running our tax and social security systems. By
comparison with private industry, local direct labour schemes waste an
estimated £400 million a year. Other examples of waste abound, such as the
plan to spend £50 million to build another town hall in Southwark.

Trade Union Reform

Free trade unions can only flourish in a free society. A strong and responsible
trade union movement could play a big part in our economic recovery. We
cannot go on, year after year, tearing ourselves apart in increasingly bitter
and calamitous industrial disputes. In bringing about economic recovery, we
should all be on the same side. Government and public, management and
unions, employers and employees, all have a common interest in raising
productivity and profits, thus increasing investment and employment, and
improving real living standards for everyone in a high-productivity, high-
wage, low-tax economy. Yet at the moment we have the reverse an economy
in which the Government has to hold wages down to try to make us
competitive with other countries where higher real wages are paid for by
higher output.

The crippling industrial disruption which hit Britain last winter had several
causes: years with no growth in production; rigid pay control; high marginal
rates of taxation; and the extension of trade union power and privileges.
Between 1974 and 1976, Labour enacted a 'militants' charter' of trade union
legislation. It tilted the balance of power in bargaining throughout industry
away from responsible management and towards unions, and sometimes

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 21

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

towards unofficial groups of workers acting in defiance of their official union
leadership.

We propose three changes which must be made at once. Although the
Government refused our offer of support to carry them through the House of
Commons last January, our proposals command general assent inside and
outside the trade union movement.

1. Picketing

Workers involved in a dispute have a right to try peacefully to persuade
others to support them by picketing, but we believe that right should be
limited to those in dispute picketing at their own place of work. In the last
few years some of the picketing we have witnessed has gone much too far.
Violence, intimidation and obstruction cannot be tolerated. We shall ensure
that the protection of the law is available to those not concerned in the
dispute but who at present can suffer severely from secondary action
(picketing, blacking and blockading). This means an immediate review of
the existing law on immunities in the light of recent decisions, followed by
such amendment as may be appropriate of the 1976 legislation in this field.
We shall also make any further changes that are necessary so that a citizen's
right to work and go about his or her lawful business free from intimidation
or obstruction is guaranteed.

2. THE CLOSED SHOP

Labour's strengthening of the closed shop has made picketing a more
objectionable weapon. In some disputes, pickets have threatened other
workers with the withdrawal of their union cards if they refuse to co-operate.
No union card can mean no job. So the law must be changed. People
arbitrarily excluded or expelled from any union must be given the right of
appeal to a court of law. Existing employees and those with personal
conviction must be adequately protected, and if they lose their jobs as a
result of a closed shop they must be entitled to ample compensation.

In addition, all agreements for a closed shop must be drawn up in line with
the best practice followed at present and only if an overwhelming majority
of the workers involved vote for it by secret ballot. We shall therefore
propose a statutory code under Section 6 of the 1975 Employment Protection
Act. We will not permit a closed shop in the non-industrial civil service and
will resist further moves towards it in the newspaper industry. We are also
committed to an enquiry into the activities of the SLADE union, which have
done so much to bring trade unionism into disrepute.

3. WIDER PARTICIPATION

Too often trade unions are dominated by a handful of extremists who do not
reflect the common-sense views of most union members.

Wider use of secret ballots for decision-making throughout the trade union

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 21

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

movement should be given every encouragement. We will therefore provide

public funds for postal ballots for union elections and other important issues.
Every trade unionist should be free to record his decisions as every voter has
done for a hundred years in parliamentary elections, without others watching
and taking note.

We welcome closer involvement of workers, whether trade unionists or not,
in the decisions that affect them at their place of work. It would be wrong to
impose by law a system of participation in every company. It would be
equally wrong to use the pretext of encouraging genuine worker
involvement in order simply to increase union power or facilitate union
control of pension funds.

Too Many Strikes

Further changes may be needed to encourage people to behave responsibly
and keep the bargains they make at work. Many deficiencies of British
industrial relations are without foreign parallel. Strikes are too often a
weapon of first rather than last resort. One cause is the financial treatment of
strikers and their families. In reviewing the position, therefore, we shall
ensure that unions bear their fair share of the cost of supporting those of
their members who are on strike.

Labour claim that industrial relations in Britain cannot be improved by
changing the law. We disagree. If the law can be used to confer privileges, it
can and should also be used to establish obligations. We cannot allow a
repetition of the behaviour that we saw outside too many of our factories and
hospitals last winter.

Responsible Pay Bargaining

Labour's approach to industrial relations and their disastrous economic
policies have made realistic and responsible pay bargaining almost
impossible. After encouraging the 'social contract! chaos of 1974-5, they
tried to impose responsibility by the prolonged and rigid control of incomes.
This policy collapsed last winter as we warned that it would. The Labour
government then came full circle with the announcement of yet another
‘social contract' with the unions. For five years now, the road to ruin has been
paved with such exchanges of promises between the Labour government and
the unions.

To restore responsible pay bargaining, we must all start by recognising that
Britain is a low-paid country because we have steadily become less efficient,
less productive, less reliable and less competitive. Under this Government,
we have more than doubled our pay but actually produced less in
manufacturing industry. It will do yet further harm to go on printing money
to pay ourselves more without first earning more. That would lead to even
higher prices, fewer jobs and falling living standards.

The return to responsibility will not be easy. It requires that people keep

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 21

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

more of what they earn; that effort and skill earn larger rewards; and that the
State leaves more resources for industry. There should also be more open
and informed discussion of the Government's economic objectives (as
happens, for example, in Germany and other countries) so that there is wider
understanding of the consequences of unrealistic bargaining and industrial
action.

Pay bargaining in the private sector should be left to the companies and
workers concerned. At the end of the day, no one should or can protect them
from the results of the agreements they make.

Different considerations apply to some extent to the public sector, of whose
seven million workers the Government directly employs only a minority. In
the great public corporations, pay bargaining should be governed, as in
private ones, by what each can afford. There can be no question of
subsidising excessive pay deals.

Pay bargaining in central and local government, and other services such as
health and education, must take place within the limits of what the taxpayer
and ratepayer can afford. It is conducted under a variety of arrangements,
some of long standing, such as pay research. In consultation with the unions,
we will reconcile these with the cash limits used to control public spending,
and seek to conclude no-strike agreements in a few essential services.
Bargaining must also be put on a sounder economic footing, so that public
sector wage settlements take full account of supply and demand md
diflerences between regions, manning levels, job security and pension
arrangements.

3. A more prosperous country

LABOUR HAVE GONE to great lengths to try to conceal the damage they
have done to the economy and to our prospects of economic expansion.
Even in the depression of the 1930s the British economy progressed more
than it has under this Labour government. Their favourite but totally false
excuse is that their appalling record is all due to the oil crisis and the world-
wide economic depression. Yet since the oil crisis, despite our coal, and gas
and oil from the North Sea, prices and unemployment in Britain have risen
by more than in almost any other major industrial country. And output has
risen by less. With much poorer energy supplies than Britain, the others have
nonetheless done much better because they have not had a Labour
government or suffered from Labour's mistakes.

To become more prosperous, Britain must become more productive and the
British people must be given more incentive.

Cutting Income Tax
We shall cut income tax at all levels to reward hard work, responsibility and

success; tackle the poverty trap; encourage saving and the wider ownership
of property; simplify taxes - like VAT; and reduce tax bureaucracy.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 21

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

It is especially important to cut the absurdly high marginal rates of tax both
at the bottom and top of the income scale. It must pay a man or woman
significantly more to be in, rather than out of; work. Raising tax thresholds
will let the low-paid out of the tax net altogether, and unemployment and
short-term sickness benefit must be brought into the computation of annual
income.

The top rate of income tax should be cut to the European average and the
higher tax bands widened. To encourage saving we will reduce the burden of
the investment income surcharge. This will greatly help those pensioners
who pay this additional tax on the income from their life-time savings, and
who suffer so badly by comparison with members of occupational or
inflation-proofed pension schemes.

Growing North Sea oil revenues and reductions in Labour s public spending
plans Will not be enough to pay for the income tax cuts the country needs.
We must therefore be prepared to switch to some extent from taxes on
earnings to taxes on spending. Value Added Tax does not apply, and will not
be extended, to necessities like food, fuel, housing and transport. Moreover
the levels of State pensions and other benefits take price rises into account.

Labour's extravagance and incompetence have once again imposed a heavy
burden on ratepayers this year. But cutting income tax must take priority for
the time being over abolition of the domestic rating system.

A Property-Owning Democracy

Unlike Labour, we want more people to have the security and satisfaction of
owning property. Our proposals for encouraging home ownership are
contained in Chapter 5.

We reject Labour's plan for a Wealth Tax. We shall deal with the most
damaging features of the Capital Transfer and Capital Gains Taxes, and
propose a simpler and less oppressive system of capital taxation in the
longer term. We will expand and build on existing schemes for encouraging
employee share-ownership and our tax policies generally will provide
incentive to save and build up capital.

Industry, Commerce and Jobs

Lower taxes on earnings and savings will encourage economic growth. But
on their own they will not be enough to secure it.

Profits are the foundation of a free enterprise economy. In Britain profits are
still dangerously low. Price controls can prevent them from reaching a level
adequate for the investment we need. In order to ensure effective
competition and fair pricing policies, we will review the working of the
Monopolies Commission, the Office of Fair Trading and the Price
Commission, with the legislation which governs their activities.

Too much emphasis has been placed on attempts to preserve existing jobs.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 21

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

We need to concentrate more on the creation of conditions in which new,
more modem, more secure, better paid jobs come into existence. This is the
best way of helping the unemployed and those threatened with the loss of
their jobs in the future.

Government strategies and plans cannot produce revival, nor can subsidies.
Where it is in the national interest to help a firm in difficulties, such help
must be temporary and tapered.

We all hope that those firms which are at present being helped by the
taxpayer will soon be able to succeed by themselves; but success or failure
lies in their own hands.

Of course, government can help to ease industrial change in those regions
dependent on older, declining industries. We do not propose sudden, sharp
changes in the measures now in force. However, there is a strong case for
relating government assistance to projects more closely to the number of
jobs they create.

Nationalisation

The British people strongly oppose Labour's plans to nationalise yet more
firms and industries such as building, banking, insurance, pharmaceuticals
and road haulage. More nationalisation would further impoverish us and
further undermine our freedom. We will offer to sell back to private
ownership the recently nationalised aerospace and shipbuilding concerns,
giving their employees the opportunity to purchase shares.

We aim to sell shares in the National Freight Corporation to the general
public in order to achieve substantial private investment in it. We will also
relax the Traffic Commissioner licensing regulations to enable new bus and
other services to develop-particularly in rural areas-and we will encourage
new private operators.

Even where Labour have not nationalised they interfere too much. We shall
therefore amend the '975 Industry Act and restrict the powers of the National
Enterprise Board solely to the administration of the Government's temporary
shareholdings, to be sold off as circumstances permit. We want to see those
industries that remain nationalised running more successfully and we will
therefore interfere less with their management and set them a clearer
financial discipline in which to work.

High productivity is the key to the future of industries like British Rail,
where improvements would benefit both the work-force and passengers who
have faced unprecedented fare increases over the last five years.

Fair Trade

Just as we reject nationalisation, so we are opposed to the other Socialist
panacea-import controls. They would restrict consumer choice, raise prices
and invite damaging retaliation against British goods overseas. We will

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 21

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

vigorously oppose all kinds of dumping and other unfair foreign trade
practices that undermine jobs at home.

We fully support the renegotiated Multi-fibre Arrangement for textiles and
will insist that it is monitored effectively and speedily. We also believe in a
revised 'safeguard' clause under GATT, to give us a better defence against
sudden and massive surges of imports that destroy jobs.

Small Businesses

The creation of new jobs depends to a great extent on the success of smaller
businesses. They have been especially hard hit under Labour. Our cuts in
direct and capital taxation, the simplification of VAT and our general
economic and industrial relations policies are the key to their future. We
shall make planning restraints less rigid; reduce the number of official forms
and make them simpler; provide safeguards against unfair competition from
direct labour; review the new 714 Certificate system for subcontractors and
review with representatives of the self-employed their National Insurance
and pension position. We shall amend laws such as the Employment
Protection Act where they damage smaller businesses-and larger ones too-
and actually prevent the creation of jobs.

We shall also undertake a thorough review of the enforcement procedures of
Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue, and introduce an easier regime
for small firms in respect of company law and the disclosure of their affairs.

Energy

The development of our energy resources provides a challenge for both our
nationalised industries and the private sector. Nowhere has private enterprise
been more successful in creating jobs and wealth for the nation than in
bringing North Sea oil and gas ashore. These benefits will be short-lived
unless we pursue a vigorous policy for energy saving. Labour's interference
has discouraged investment and could cost Britain billions of pounds in lost
revenue. We shall undertake a complete review of all the activities of the
British National Oil Corporation as soon as we take office. We shall ensure
that our oil tax and licensing policies encourage new production.

We believe that a competitive and efficient coal industry has an important
role in meeting energy demand, together with a proper contribution from
nuclear power. All energy developments raise important environmental
issues, and we shall ensure the fullest public participation in major new
decisions.

Agriculture

Our agricultural and food industries are as important and as efficient as any
that we have. They make an immense contribution to our balance of
payments; they provide jobs for millions of people and they sustain the

economy of the countryside. Labour have seriously undermined the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 21

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

profitability of these industries, without protecting consumers against rising
food prices which have more than doubled during their term of office. We
must ensure that these industries have the means to keep abreast of those in
other countries.

We believe that radical changes in the operation of the Common Agricultural
Policy (CAP) are necessary. We would, in particular, aim to devalue the
Green Pound within the normal lifetime of a Parliament to a point which
would enable our producers to compete on level terms with those in the rest
of the Community. We will insist on a freeze in CAP prices for products in
structural surplus. This should be maintained until the surpluses are
eliminated. We could not entertain discriminatory proposals such as those
which the Commission recently put forward for milk production.

The Uplands are an important part of our agriculture. Those who live and
work there should enjoy a reasonable standard of life.

Fishing

The Government's failure to negotiate with our Community partners proper
arrangements for fishing has left the industry in a state of uncertainty. The
general adoption of 200-mile limits has fundamentally altered the situation
which existed when the Treaty of Accession was negotiated. We would work
for an agreement which recognised: first, that United Kingdom waters
contained more fish than those of the rest of the Community countries put
together; secondly, the loss of fishing opportunities experienced by our
fishermen; thirdly, the rights of inshore fishermen; last, and perhaps most
important of all, the need for effective measures to conserve fish stocks
which would be policed by individual coastal states. In the absence of
agreement, we would not hesitate to take the necessary measures on our
own, but of course on a non-discriminatory basis.

Animal Welfare

The welfare of animals is an issue that concerns us all. There are problems in
certain areas and we will act immediately where it is necessary. More
specifically, we will give full support to the EEC proposals on the
transportation of animals. We shall update the Brambell Report, the codes of
welfare for farm animals, and the legislation on experiments on live animals.
We shall also re-examine the rules and enforcement applying to the export of
live animals and shall halt the export of cows and ewes recently calved and
lambed.

4. The rule of law

THE MOST DISTURBING THREAT to our freedom and security is the
growing disrespect for the rule of law. In government as in opposition,
Labour have undermined it. Yet respect for the rule of law is the basis of a
free and civilised life. We will restore it, re-establishing the supremacy of

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 21

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

Parliament and giving the right priority to the fight against crime.

The Fight against Crime

The number of crimes in England and Wales is nearly half as much again as
it was in 1973. The next Conservative government will spend more on
fighting crime even while we economise elsewhere.

Britain needs strong, efficient police forces with high morale. Improved pay
and conditions will help Chief Constables to recruit up to necessary
establishment levels. We will therefore implement in full the
recommendations of the Edmund Davies Committee. The police need more
time to detect crime. So we will ease the weight of traffic supervision duties
and review cumbersome court procedures which waste police time. We will
also review the traffic laws, including the totting-up procedure.

Deterring the Criminal

Surer detection means surer deterrence. We also need better crime
prevention measures and more flexible, more effective sentencing. For
violent criminals and thugs really tough sentences are essential. But in other
cases long prison terms are not always the best deterrent. So we want to see
a wider variety of sentences available to the courts. We will therefore amend
the 1961 Criminal Justice Act which limits prison sentences on young adult
offenders, and revise the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 to give
magistrates the power to make residential and secure care orders on
juveniles.

We need more compulsory attendance centres for hooligans at junior and
senior levels. In certain detention centres we will experiment with a tougher
regime as a short, sharp shock for young criminals. For certain types of
offenders, we also support the greater use of community service orders,
intermediate treatment and attendance centres. Unpaid fines and
compensation orders are ineffective. Fines should be assessed to punish the
offender within his means and then be backed by effective sanctions for non-
payment.

Many people advocate capital punishment for murder. This must remain a
matter of conscience for Members of Parliament. But we will give the new
House of Commons an early opportunity for a free vote on this issue.

Immigration and Race Relations

The rights of all British citizens legally settled here are equal before the law
whatever their race, colour or creed. And their opportunities ought to be
equal too. The ethnic minorities have already made a valuable contribution
to the life of our nation. But firm immigration control for the future is
essential if we are to achieve good community relations. It will end
persistent fears about levels of immigration and will remove from those

settled, and in many cases born here, the label of 'immigrant'.

(1) We shall introduce a new British Nationality Act to define entitlement to
British citizenship and to the right of abode in this country. It will not
adversely affect the right of anyone now permanently settled here.

(ii) We shall end the practice of allowing permanent settlement for those
who come here for a temporary stay.

(iii) We shall limit entry of parents, grandparents and children over 18 toa
small number of urgent compassionate cases.

(iv) We shall end the concession introduced by the Labour government in
1974 to husbands and male fiancés.

(v) We shall severely restrict the issue of work permits.

(vi) We shall introduce a Register of those Commonwealth wives and
children entitled to entry for settlement under the 1971 Immigration Act.

(vii) We shall then introduce a quota system, covering everyone outside the
European Community, to control all entry for settlement.

(viii) We shall take firm action against illegal immigrants and overstayers
and help those immigrants who genuinely wish to leave this country-but
there can be no question of compulsory repatriation.

We will encourage the improvement of language training in schools and
factories and of training facilities for the young unemployed in the ethnic
communities. But these measures will achieve little without the effective
control of immigration. That is essential for racial harmony in Britain today.

The Supremacy of Parliament

In recent years, Parliament has been weakened in two ways. First, outside
groups have been allowed to usurp some of its democratic functions. Last
winter, the Government permitted strike committees and pickets to take on
powers and responsibilities which should have been discharged by
Parliament and the police. Second, the traditional role of our legislature has
suffered badly from the growth of government over the last quarter of a
century.

We will see that Parliament and no other body stands at the centre of the
nation's life and decisions, and we will seek to make it effective in its job of
controlling the Executive.

We sympathise with the approach of the all-party parliamentary committees
which put forward proposals last year for improving the way the House of
Commons legislates and scrutinises public spending and the work of
government departments. We will give the new House of Commons an early
chance of coming to a decision on these proposals.

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

The public has rightly grown anxious about many constitutional matters in
the last few years - partly because our opponents have proposed major
constitutional changes for party political advantage. Now Labour want not
merely to abolish the House of' Lords but to put nothing in its place. This
would be a most dangerous step. A strong Second Chamber is necessary not
only to revise legislation but also to guarantee our constitution and liberties.

It is not only the future of the Second Chamber which is at issue. We are
committed to discussions about the future government of Scotland, and have
put forward proposals for improved parliamentary control of administration
in Wales. There are other important matters, such as a possible Bill of
Rights, the use of referendums, and the relationship between Members of the
European Parliament and Westminster, which we shall wish to discuss with
all parties.

Northern Ireland

We shall maintain the Union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in
accordance with the wish of the majority in the Province. Its future still
depends on the defeat of terrorism and the restoration of law and order. We
shall continue with the help of the courage, resolution and restraint of the
Security Forces-to give it the highest priority. There will be no amnesty for
convicted terrorists.

In the absence of devolved government, we will seek to establish one or
more elected regional councils with a wide range of powers over local
services. We recognise that Northern Ireland's industry will continue to
require government support.

5. Helping the family

Homes of Our Own

To most people ownership means first and foremost a home of their own.

Many find it difficult today to raise the deposit for a mortgage. Our tax cuts
will help them. We shall encourage shared purchase schemes which will
enable people to buy a house or fiat on mortgage, on the basis initially of a
part-payment which they complete later when their incomes are high
enough. We should like in time to improve on existing legislation with a
realistic grants scheme to assist first-time buyers of cheaper homes. As it
costs about three times as much to subsidise a new council house as it does
to give tax relief to a home buyer, there could well be a substantial saving to
the tax and ratepayer.

The prospect of very high mortgage interest rates deters some people from
buying their homes and the reality can cause acute difficulties to those who
have done so. Mortgage rates have risen steeply because of the
Government's financial mismanagement. Our plans for cutting government
spending and borrowing will lower them.

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

The Sale of Council Houses

Many families who live on council estates and in new towns would like to
buy their own homes but either cannot afford to or are prevented by the local
authority or the Labour government. The time has come to end these
restrictions. In the first session of the next Parliament we shall therefore give
council and new town tenants the legal right to buy their homes, while
recognising the special circumstances of rural areas and sheltered housing
for the elderly. Subject to safeguards over resale, the terms we propose
would allow a discount on market values reflecting the fact that council
tenants effectively have security of tenure. Our discounts will range from 33
per cent after three years, rising with length of tenancy to a maximum of 50
per cent after twenty years. We shall also ensure that 100 per cent mortgages
are available for the purchase of council and new town houses. We shall
introduce a right for these tenants to obtain limited term options on their
homes so that they know in advance the price at which they can buy, while
they save the money to do so.

As far as possible, we will extend these rights to housing association tenants.
At the very least, we shall give these associations the power to sell to their
tenants.

Those council house tenants who do not wish to buy their homes will be
given new rights and responsibilities under our Tenants' Charter.

The Private Rented Sector

As well as giving new impetus to the movement towards home ownership,
we must make better use of our existing stock of houses. Between 1973 and
1977 no fewer than 400,000 dwellings were withdrawn from private rental.
There are now hundreds of thousands of empty properties in Britain which
are not let because the owners are deterred by legislation. We intend to
introduce a new system of shorthold tenure which will allow short fixed-
term lettings of these properties free of the most discouraging conditions of
the present law. This provision will not, of course, affect the position of
existing tenants. There should also be more flexible arrangements covering
accommodation for students. At the same time, we must try to achieve a
greater take-up in rent allowances for poorer tenants.

Protecting the Environment

The quality of our environment is a vital concern to all of us. The last
Conservative government had a proud record of achievement in reducing
pollution, and protecting our heritage and countryside. We shall continue to
give these issues a proper priority. Subject to the availability of resources we
shall pay particular attention to the improvement and restoration of derelict
land, the disposal and recycling of dangerous and other wastes, and reducing
pollution of our rivers and canals.

We attach particular importance to measures to reduce fuel consumption by

improving insulation.
Standards in Education

The Labour Party is still obsessed with the structure of the schools system,
paying too little regard to the quality of education. As a result we have a
system which in the view of many of our parents and teachers all too often
fails - at a cost of over £8 billion a year - even to provide pupils with the
means of communication and understanding. We must restore to every child,
regardless of background, the chance to progress as far as his or her abilities
allow.

We will halt the Labour government's policies which have led to the
destruction of good schools; keep those of proven worth; and repeal those
sections of the 1976 Education Act which compel local authorities to
reorganise along comprehensive lines and restrict their freedom to take up
places at independent schools.

We shall promote higher standards of achievement in basic skills. The
Government's Assessment of Performance Unit will set national standards in
reading, writing and arithmetic, monitored by tests worked out with teachers
and others and applied locally by education authorities. The Inspectorate will
be strengthened. In teacher training there must be more emphasis on
practical skills and on maintaining discipline.

Much of our higher education in Britain has a world-wide reputation for its
quality. We shall seek to ensure that this excellence is maintained. We are
aware of the special problems associated with the need to increase the
number of high-quality entrants to the engineering professions. We shall
review the relationship between school, further education and training to see
how better use can be made of existing resources.

We recognise the valuable work done by the Youth Service and will continue
to give help to those voluntary bodies which make such a considerable
contribution in this field.

Parents' Rights and Responsibilities

Extending parents' rights and responsibilities, including their right of choice,
will also help raise standards by giving them greater influence over
education. Our Parents' Charter will place a clear duty on government and
local authorities to take account of parents' wishes when allocating children
to schools, with a local appeals system for those dissatisfied. Schools will be
required to publish prospectuses giving details of their examination and
other results.

The Direct Grant schools, abolished by Labour, gave wider opportunities for
bright children from modest backgrounds. The Direct Grant principle will
therefore be restored with an Assisted Places Scheme. Less well-off parents
will be able to claim part or all of the fees at certain schools from a special

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39
government fund.
The Arts

Economic failure and Socialist policies have placed the arts under threat.
Lightening the burden of tax should in time enable the private sponsor to
flourish again and the reform of capital taxation will lessen the threat to our
heritage. We will strengthen the existing provision whereby relief from CTT
is available on assets placed in a maintenance fund for the support of
heritage property. We favour the establishment of a National Heritage Fund
to help preserve historic buildings and artistic treasures for the nation. We
will continue to give as generous support to Britain's cultural and artistic life
as the country can afford.

Sport and recreation have also been hit by inflation and high taxation. We
will continue to support the Sports Councils in the encouragement of
recreation and international sporting achievement.

Health and Welfare

The welfare of the old, the sick, the handicapped and the deprived has also
suffered under Labour. The lack of money to improve our social services and
assist those in need can only be overcome by restoring the nation's
prosperity. But some improvements can be made now by spending what we
do have more sensibly.

In our National Health Service standards are falling; there is a crisis of
morale; too often patients' needs do not come first. It is not our intention to
reduce spending on the Health Service indeed, we intend to make better use
of what resources are available. So we will simplify and decentralise the
service and cut back bureaucracy.

When resources are so tightly stretched it is folly to turn good money away
from the NHS and to discourage people from doing more for themselves. We
shall therefore allow pay-beds to be provided where there is a demand for
them; end Labour's vendetta against the private health sector; and restore tax
relief on employer-employee medical insurance schemes. The Royal
Commission on the Health Service is studying the financing of health care,
and any examination of possible longer term changes - for example greater
reliance for NHS funding on the insurance pnnciple - must await their report.

In the community, we must do more to help people to help themselves, and
families to look after their own. We must also encourage the voluntary
movement and self-help groups working in partnership with the statutory
services.

Making Sense of Social Security

Our social security system is now so complicated that even some Ministry
officials do not understand it. Income tax starts at such a low level that many

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 21

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

poor people are being taxed to pay for their own benefits. All too often they
are little or no better off at work than they are on social security.

This was one of our principal reasons for proposing a tax credit scheme.
Child benefits are a step in the right direction. Further progress will be very
difficult in the next few years, both for reasons of cost and because of
technical problems involved in the switch to computers. We shall wish to
move towards the fulfilment of our original tax credit objectives as and when
resources become available. Meanwhile we shall do all we can to find other
ways to simplify the system, restore the incentive to work, reduce the
poverty trap and bring more effective help to those in greatest need.

Restoring the will to work means, above all, cutting income tax. It also
involves bringing unemployment and short-term sickness benefit within the
tax system an objective fully shared by Labour Ministers. The rules about
the unemployed accepting available jobs will be reinforced and we shall act
more vigorously against fraud and abuse.

We welcomed the new Child Benefit as the first stage of our tax credit
scheme. One-parent families face much hardship so we will maintain the
special addition for them.

The Elderly and the Disabled

We will honour the increases in retirement pensions which were promised
just before the election.

However, like others, pensioners have suffered from the high taxes and
catastrophic inflation of Labour's years.

It is wrong to discourage people who wish to work after retirement age, and
we will phase out the 'earnings rule' during the next Parliament. The
Christmas Bonus, which the last Conservative government started in 1972,
will continue. We will exempt war widows' pensions from tax and provide a
pension for pre-1950 widows of ‘other ranks' who do not receive one at
present.

Much has been done in recent years to help the disabled, but there is still a
long way to go. Our aim is to provide a coherent system of cash benefits to
meet the costs of disability, so that more disabled people can support
themselves and live normal lives. We shall work towards this as swiftly as
the strength of the economy allows.

6. A strong Britain in a free world

Improving Our Defences
During the past five years the military threat to the West has grown steadily
as the Communist bloc has established virtual parity in strategic nuclear

weapons and a substantial superiority in conventional weapons. Yet Labour

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 18 of 21

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

have cut down our forces, weakened our defences and reduced our
contribution to NATO. And the Left are pressing for still more reductions.

We shall only be able to decide on the proper level of defence spending after
consultation in government with the Chiefs of Staff and our allies. But it is
already obvious that significant increases will be necessary. The SALT
discussions increase the importance of ensuring the continuing effectiveness
of Britain's nuclear deterrent.

In recent times our armed forces have had to deal with a wide variety of
national emergencies. They have responded magnificently despite
government neglect and a severe shortage of manpower and equipment. We
will give our servicemen decent living conditions, bring their pay up to full
comparability with their civilian counterparts immediately and keep it there.
In addition, we must maintain the efficiency of our reserve forces. We will
improve their equipment, too, and hope to increase their strength.

The European Community

If we wish to play our full part in shaping world events over the next few
critical years, we must also work honestly and genuinely with our partners in
the European Community. There is much that we can achieve together, much
more than we can achieve alone.

There are some Community policies which need to be changed since they do
not suit Britain's - or Europe's - best interests. But it is wrong to argue, as
Labour do, that Europe has failed us. What has happened is that under
Labour our country has been prevented from taking advantage of the
opportunities which membership offers.

Labour's economic policies have blunted our competitive edge and made it
more difficult for our companies to sell in our partners' markets. What is
more, the frequently obstructive and malevolent attitude of Labour Ministers
has weakened the Community as a whole and Britain's bargaining power
within it.

By forfeiting the trust of our partners, Labour have made it much more
difficult to persuade them to agree to the changes that are necessary in such
important areas as the Common Agricultural Policy, the Community budget,
and the proposed Common Fisheries Policy.

The next Conservative government will restore Britain's influence by
convincing our partners of our commitment to the Community's success.
This will enable us to protect British interests and to play a leading and
constructive role in the Community's efforts to tackle the many problems
which it faces.

We shall work for a common-sense Community which resists excessive
bureaucracy and unnecessary harmonisation proposals, holding to the
principles of free enterprise which inspired its original founders.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 19 of 21

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

Our policies for the reform of the CAP (see Chapter 3) would reduce the
burden which the Community budget places upon the British taxpayer. We
shall also strive to cut out waste in other Community spending programmes.

National payments into the budget should be more closely related to ability
to pay. Spending from the budget should be concentrated more strictly on
policies and projects on which it makes sense for the Community rather than
nation states to take the lead.

We attach particular importance to the co-ordination of Member States'
foreign policies. In a world dominated by the super-powers, Britain and her
partners are best able to protect their international interests and to contribute
to world peace and stability when they speak with a single voice.

Africa and The Middle East

In Africa and the Middle East, there is an increasing threat from the Soviet
Union and its Cuban allies. That threat must be countered, not only through
collaboration with our European and American allies but also by the people
and governments in Africa and the Middle East whose independence is
threatened.

We shall do all we can to build on the Egyptian/Israeli peace treaty, to seek a
comprehensive settlement which will bring peace to the whole region.

Rhodesia

The Conservative Party will aim to achieve a lasting settlement to the
Rhodesia problem based on the democratic wishes of the people of that
country. If the Six Principles, which all British governments have supported
for the last fifteen years, are fully satisfied following the present Rhodesian
Election, the next government will have the duty to return Rhodesia to a
state of legality, move to lift sanctions, and do its utmost to ensure that the
new independent state gains international recognition.

Trade, Aid and the Commonwealth

Like other industrial countries, Britain has a vital interest in bringing
prosperity to poorer nations which provide us with a growing market and
supply many of the raw materials upon which we depend. The next
Conservative government will help them through national and international
programmes of aid and technical co-operation and by the encouragement of
voluntary work. But we also attach particular importance to the development
of trade and private investment through such instruments as the European
Community's Lomé Convention. In particular, we will foster all our
Commonwealth links and seek to harness to greater cifret the collective
influence of the Commonwealth in world affairs.

7. Anew beginning

1979 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

IN THIS MANIFESTO we have not sought to understate the difficulties
which face us-the economic and social problems at home, the threats to the
freedom of the West abroad. Yet success and security are attainable if we
have the courage and confidence to seize the opportunities which are open to
us.

We make no lavish promises. The repeated disappointment of rising
expectations has led to a marked loss of faith in politicians' promises. Too
much has gone wrong in Britain for us to hope to put it all right in a year or
so. Many things will simply have to wait until the economy has been revived
and we are once again creating the wealth on which so much else depends.

Most people, in their hearts, know that Britain has to come to terms with
reality. They no longer have any time for politicians who try to gloss over
the harsh facts of life. Most people want to be told the truth, and to be given
a clear lead towards the action needed for recovery.

The years of make-believe and false optimism are over. It is time for a new
beginning.

October 1974 Conservative Party
General Election Manifesto

Putting Britain First

A national policy

The dangers now facing Britain are greater than any we have seen since the
last war. These dangers are both economic and political.

Over recent months prices have been rising at an annual rate of over 20 per
cent, and on present policies they will rise as much next year. This means
that in two years the pound will be worth only 55p. Unemployment is rising
rapidly, and the deficit in our balance of payments this year will be £4,000
million. By the end of the 1970s, on present forecasts, we are likely to owe
£15,000 million for oil alone.

At the same time the rule of law is threatened, and there are conflicts within
the nation.

If we do not solve our economic problems, our political difficulties will be
made worse. And if we do not tackle our political problems, our economic
problems will be insoluble.

Our main aim therefore is to safeguard the existence of our free society.

For inflation at its present pace threatens not only the standard of living of
everybody in the country, but also the survival of our free and democratic
institutions. No major democracy has ever survived such a catastrophic rise
in the cost of living. We cannot be sure that we would be the exception.

In any case inflation and rising prices tear society apart. They destroy the
confidence of people in one another and the future; they distort the existing
relationships within our country; they poison the social environment; they
wipe out people's savings; they imperil our economic system; they lead in
the end to high unemployment and to widespread, if not national,
bankruptcy; and they bring particular hardship and misery to the most
vulnerable people in the land.

And that is not all. Another consequence of inflation is that financial
manipulations often provide much greater scope for gain than solid hard
work. This in itself breeds disillusionment and frustration. Lack of
confidence in the currency leads to lessening respect for the law: hence

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

sectional groups are starting to take the law into their own hands and to
pursue their ends with a ruthless disregard for the interests of others.

Finally, inflation weakens international confidence in sterling and intensifies
the balance of payments crisis. In a few years time North Sea oil should give
us an advantage over many of our competitors. But if we rely too much on
borrowing from abroad to finance our payments deficit, our gains from
North Sea oil will be mortgaged for many years ahead, and our hopes for
prosperity based upon that oil will be dashed.

Inflation is therefore a moral and political evil as well as a social and
economic evil. Everything else is secondary to the battle against inflation
and to helping those who have been wounded in it.

There is no quick or simple way of defeating inflation. We do not claim to
have any easy solution. Indeed no government can beat inflation by itself.

The only way the battle can be won is by the Government and the people of
this country uniting on a national policy. In the interest of national unity we
will not re-introduce the Industrial Relations Act. Equally, no government
should pursue a policy of wholesale nationalisation for party ends nor seek
to further the interests of only a section or a class of the population. And
certainly our economic condition is far too grave for our country to be
subjected to a divisive and dogmatic attack upon the private enterprise sector
of our economy.

Inflation has dogged Britain since the war because as a country we have too
often paid ourselves more than we earn. Lately this chronic inflation has
been made acute by the explosion in the world price of food and raw
materials.

We need to bring back confidence in our currency; we need to stop paying
ourselves more than we produce; and we need to produce more than we have
produced in the past.

To restore confidence in our currency we propose a comprehensive price
stabilisation programme. This will use every tolerable means available to
fight inflation. We will rigorously control public spending and the money
supply and there must be restraint in prices and incomes.

Because of the economic crisis there is no room for any early improvement
in living standards. But our aim is to protect people's real income as far as it
is possible to do so - by increasing pensions and other long4erm benefits
every six months, by developing new forms of savings protected against
inflation, and by pay arrangements which take account of rises in the cost of
living.

This is a far better way of protecting the interests of people at work than the
excessive increases in some wage settlements over the last few months.
These merely feed inflation and lead eventually to heavy unemployment. We
believe that our attempt to protect the real value of wages, combined with

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

the responsible self-interest of trade unions, should make a voluntary policy
on pay and prices effective. But no government could honestly say that it
will never be necessary to use the law in the national interest to support an
effective policy for fighting inflation. In the absence of a viable prices and
incomes policy any government would have to take harsher financial and
economic measures than would otherwise be needed.

Restraint and restriction are only palliatives. The best way of solving
Britain's economic problems is by increasing our productivity and expanding
British agriculture. It is only by producing more wealth that we can
significantly help those who need help: the poor, the sick and the old. There
is enormous scope for improving productivity, and our taxation and
industrial policies will be directed towards this objective.

Yet only part of our troubles are economic, and inflation is not the only
threat to our free way of life. Modern industrial society is fragile. It is
vulnerable to the terrorist and the anarchist. But at present an even greater
danger is the short-sighted selfishness of some powerful groups. The great
technological advances of this century have closely integrated our economy
and the whole organisation of national life. This integration has brought
immense material advantages, but by laying society open to disruption it has
brought weakness as well. The whole is at the mercy of a part to an extent
unimagined even a few years ago.

Nevertheless no part of the nation can exist by itself. Disruption may bring
temporary advantage to a few, but all are hurt in the end. The nation is
diminished and impoverished by it.

Trade unions are an important estate of the realm. We shall co-operate
closely with them, and we hope that our proposals for industrial partnership
will lead to close and effective co-operation both with employees and
management. But we shall not be dominated by the trade unions. They are
not the government of the country.

We believe that the survival of a mixed economy is vital to national
prosperity. If all economic power were in the hands of politicians and civil
servants, if all economic and industrial decisions were taken in Whitehall,
Britain would become a dictatorship. An all-powerful government is the end
of freedom.

A mixed economy ensures the diffusion of power. That is the only way we
can prevent the abuse of power. Hence, the destruction of the mixed
economy would entail the destruction of our democratic liberties, and the
end of our parliamentary democracy.

Obviously the struggle against inflation and the gravity of Britain's economic
predicament prevent us from doing immediately all the things we should like

to do. Like everyone else, governments must practise restraint.

In the present economic emergency it would be irresponsible for any
government to pretend that there can be general increases in public spending

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

in real terms. This means having to postpone many of the things we would
like to do straightaway. Only as we overcome our economic difficulties will
it be possible to carry through the proposals in the second part of this
Manifesto which involve expenditure. These proposals therefore are all
subject to this important qualification.

But we will act now in three areas which have been particularly hard hit by
inflation and which in one way or another affect the basic livelihood of every
family in the country - pensions, housing and food production. Our plans for
these, which are set out later, will cost money; and in order to prevent
inflationary consequences, it may be necessary to make cuts in public
spending or increases in taxation. But as Britain's economic position
improves, our general objective will be to reduce the burden of taxation.

Our policies will lead to a united nation. We shall uphold the law and the
authority of Parliament. It is in Parliament, not in the streets, that national
policies must be worked out and disputes resolved.

Our nation still possesses great moral reserves. Our patriotism, our
knowledge that what unites us is far more significant than what divides us,
our pride in our way of life and in our institutions, our sense of history, our
idealism, our wish to make our country better and to improve the lot of our
fellow citizens - all these feelings and beliefs remain strong in Britain. But
they can only be properly summoned to the service of our nation by a
government that commands the confidence of the country because it puts the
country first.

The Conservative Party, free from dogma and free from dependence upon
any single interest, is broadly based throughout the nation. It is our objective
to win a clear majority in the House of Commons in this election. But we
will use that majority above all to unite the nation. We will not govern in a
narrow partisan spirit. After the election we will consult and confer with the
leaders of other parties and with the leaders of the great interests in the
nation, in order to secure for the government's policies the consent and
support of all men and women of good will. We will invite people from
outside the ranks of our party to join with us in overcoming Britain's
difficulties. The nation's crisis should transcend party differences.

In any event, as a national Party we will pursue a national policy in the
interests of the nation as a whole. We will lead a national effort. In normal
times the party struggle is the safeguard of freedom. But the times are far

from normal. In a crisis like this, it is the national interest which must
prevail. We will ensure that it does.

For all the people

The Challenge

We believe that, working together as a nation, we can solve our problems. It
will not be easy. It will demand restraint and sacrifice. It will mean

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

postponing some of our plans and recognising that we shall only be able to
do all the things we want if our economic and industrial policies succeed.
That should not prevent us planning for the future; and in this second part of
the manifesto we set out some of our longer term and more ambitious aims
in addition to our immediate proposals for tackling the crisis.

Paying for our Programme

If we are going to make further advances in both individual prosperity and
social provision, then we need first to set our economic house in order. But
there are some things - housing, pensions and food production - which we
believe have to be done now. In order to pay for these extra commitments
immediately we may have either to make public spending cuts elsewhere or
to raise taxes to meet the cost. But our general objective for taxes is simple
we aim to lower them. We are happy for this promise to be matched against
our record. Nevertheless, we give warning that in the present economic
climate it might prove necessary to raise some taxes in order to pay for
immediate objectives.

Politics is abour People

Our plans are firmly rooted in our belief that government and politics
are about people.

As Conservatives, we have always acted on the principle that government
has a clear responsibility to help and protect those who cannot look after
themselves. At the same time, we believe that the strength and value of any
society lies in individual freedom, effort and achievement. These
complementary themes are more relevant than ever today.

People feel increasingly frustrated and even oppressed by the impact on
their lives of remote bureaucracy, and of events which seem to be
entirely beyond their control or that of our democratic institutions.

What is more, there is a serious political challenge from the Left to that fine
balance between economic freedom and social provision which has made
this country such a civilised place to live in: the balance between giving
everyone the chance to achieve and excel and looking after those who cannot
look after themselves.

We do not believe that the great majority of people want revolutionary
change in society, or for that matter that the future happiness of our
society depends on completely altering it.

There is no majority for a massive extension of nationalisation. There is no
majority for the continued harrying of private enterprise. There is no
majority for penalising those who save, own property or make profits.
People are not clamouring for Whitehall to seize even greater control over
their lives. They want more choice and diversity, not less.

People want to be helped to achieve, not encouraged to envy. They want

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

a decent home - and most of them want to own it themselves. They want
security for their families. They want to be fairly rewarded for hard and
responsible and useful work. They want to be protected from the ravages of
inflation. They want decent schools for their children and a say in how they
are taught. They want to be able to retire in comfort, free from financial
worries. They want to live in a society where excellence and compassion go
hand in hand, and where the rules and the laws are made and upheld by the
free Parliament of a free people. The achievement of such a society will be
the aim of the next Conservative government.

People and prices

The First Priority

The first priority for any government must be to defend the value of the
currency and to bring inflation down from the present ruinous rates. This
cannot be done overnight; it cannot be done by using only one weapon; and
it cannot be done without united effort. If it is not done, the effects on every
family will be calamitous.

Controlling Public Spending

We will bring in a comprehensive price stabilisation programme which will
use every tolerable means available to fight inflation. There must be restraint
in prices and incomes and we will rigorously control public spending and the
money supply, which is a vital, though not the only, part of our counter-
inflation armoury. We will look hard at local government expenditure which
has rocketed in the last few years.

The Price Commission

We will continue the work of the Price Commission, which we set up, but
we will review the Price Code to make it more flexible, to stimulate
investment and to help provide jobs. In a time of roaring inflation, price
controls are necessary. But if they are too rigid, the money needed by
companies to stimulate investment and to help provide jobs dries up. More
efficient industrial effort is to the long-term advantage of the consumer. We
will also encourage competition between companies and will build on the
reforms introduced by our Fair Trading Act.

Incomes

Every reasonable person knows that if we pay ourselves higher wages than
we can afford, sooner or later we shall have to pay higher bills than we can
afford. There is the very real danger of a worsening wages explosion this
autumn and winter at precisely the time when world prices are starting to
ease. At the moment when we might stand a chance of getting on top of
inflation, it would be madness to give another twist to the inflationary spiral.
We must therefore as a matter of urgency, work out with the trade unions and

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

the employers a fair and effective policy for prices and incomes. We believe
that the great majority of the trade union movement will be prepared to work
with the democratically elected government of the country for the public
good. If after all our efforts we fail to get a comprehensive voluntary policy
we shall need to support the voluntary restraint that is achieved with the
back-up of the law. It would be irresponsible and dishonest totally to rule
this out, but the various methods no less than the principle would need to be
widely discussed. In the absence of an effective prices and incomes policy
any Government would have to take harsher financial and economic
measures than would otherwise be necessary.

A Better Industrial Forum

To build a more responsible partnership between government, the unions and
the employers, we must strengthen the existing National Economic
Development Council as a better industrial forum. One of its main tasks will
be to discuss how much of the nation's resources are available for pay, for
investment, for exports and for public spending.

Fairer Rewards for Hard Work and Responsibility

We would also try to reach an agreement on a new, fair and sensible system
for adjusting the relative rates of pay between different groups without
adding to inflation. There is a widespread acceptance that those who do
particularly demanding work should enjoy an improvement in their relative
pay. Yet without some national, independent body on pay relativities, this
kind of improvement will prove difficult if not impossible.

Income Protection

For our price stabilisation programme to succeed, it must enjoy the consent
of the British people. This means offering them some assurance of income
protection so that, as far as possible, incomes keep pace with the cost of
living to help safeguard real living standards. Our programme involves:

¢ Moving from an annual to a six-monthly increase in retirement
pensions, public service pensions and other long-term benefits.

e Seeking new forms of saving schemes for the small saver protected as
far as possible against inflation. We will extend the principle of special
indexed and inflation-proofed savings.

e Pay arrangements for wage and salary earners to take account of
increases in the cost of living.

This is the only fair and honest approach at a time when there is no
immediate prospect of an increase in living standards. It protects the
interests of pensioners, trade unionists and employees. We have considered
taking our income proposals much further and introducing full-scale
indexation, which has a growing number of advocates. We do not believe
that this would be the best way of protecting people from inflation if all it
did was to help us to live with inflation rather than cutting back the rate of

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

inflation itself. Nevertheless, while we are tackling the crisis it is right to
take some practical steps to help protect living standards and savings, and
this we propose to do.

Feed Prices

Food prices make up a large part of every family's budget, and we know that
the rise in the cost of food over the last few years largely caused by events
outside the control of this country or outside the Common Market has hit
many people hard. The present Government's answer has been essentially
political and cosmetic. Their food subsidies have proved wasteful. Only £1
out of every £4 has gone to those in real need and the subsidies are being
paid for by taxes on a whole range of goods and services which figure in the
budget of every ordinary family. It would have been better to help the less
well-off families direct. With the urgent. need to stabilise prices we accept
that it will be necessary to retain these subsidies for the time being.

More Home-Grown Food

In the longer term, if we want more stable food prices in the shops and a
healthier balance of payments the answer must be a considerable
expansion of British agriculture.

Given the right lead and help from government, our farmers and
farmworkers are capable of making an even greater contribution to our
economy than ever before. In today's unpredictable world, it is vital that they
should. What British agriculture needs above all is reassurance and
confidence about the future.

After 1970, British agriculture enjoyed a remarkable resurgence of
confidence. The result was a healthy increase in the supply of home-grown
food for the consumer. But in recent months the industry has suffered
severely as a result of the uncertainty over Europe caused by the present
Government and their failure to take action to deal with the grain crisis and
inflation.

Our farmers must be given the necessary confidence as rapidly as possible to
expand their industry once again. To do this, a Conservative government will
undertake an immediate review of agriculture, both nationally and on a
Community basis, followed by a cash injection as in 1970. We shall have
thorough consultations with the industry over the serious problems caused
by the rise in feedingstuff costs, and restore a guarantee for beef producers.
We will work out with the industry a more efficient system of marketing. We
will continue to press for improvements in the European Common
Agricultural Policy and work to safeguard the interests of horticulturalists
and other specialist producers. We shall remove the immensely damaging
threat of Labour's wealth tax proposals to the family farm. Our aim is to
ensure that at a time of uncertainty over world food supplies, the British
housewife can enjoy the benefits of more home-grown food that those who
work on the land are certainly capable of producing.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

The Restrictive Trade Practices legislation has led to some unexpected
difficulties for agricultural cooperatives. We shall introduce amendments to
ensure that such organisations are able to carry out the sensible purposes for
which they exist.

The Fishing Industry

It is also in the national interest, and in the interest of every housewife, to
safeguard our fishing industry. The overriding need here is to conserve
stocks. We support the move towards internationally agreed limits of 200
miles. In order to protect our waters and our fishing industry from over-
fishing by foreign boats, we made special arrangements to protect the
interests of inshore fishermen during our negotiations for entry into the
European Community. When these arrangements come up for review in
1982, we will make sure that the special interests of the inshore industry
continue to be protected.

People and industry

Encouraging Efficient Production

The most positive element in our price stabilisation programme will be
measures to encourage efficient production.

There are no short cuts to building a new prosperity. There is no alternative
to improved efficiency, higher productivity and increased production. No
government, whatever its colour, can simply switch on economic growth by
itself. It depends on the hard work, skills and enterprise of the British
people.

Our taxation and industrial policies will therefore be designed to encourage
firms to invest more money in new plant and machinery in our factories. It is
here that we have fallen behind other industrial countries. In the last few
months, investment and industrial confidence have received a terrible and
deliberate battering. Taxation has clawed back much of the cash which
industry needs. Threats of nationalisation have destroyed confidence. It is
time to call a halt to these immensely damaging policies. Above all, we must
recognise that in a mixed economy like ours, economic success depends
very largely on private enterprise. One of the most valuable things we c9uld
do for industry would be to assure it that for several years ahead, there
would be no threat of new nationalisation or more state direction.

We will introduce a major reform of company law as proposed during the
period of our last administration.

Help for the Regions

We want a partnership with industry based on trust, not a relationship of
hostility and compulsion. One important ingredient of that partnership must

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

be continuity of policy; when policies are endlessly chopped and changed,
investment plans are damaged. That is why, for example, we intend to
continue the regional policies which we pursued in office. In less than two
years these provided or safeguarded over 50,000 jobs in schemes which
received selective assistance under our Industry Act.

We will seek to rebuild confidence in the regions, offering to industry
continuity of assistance in order to achieve a real break-through in
solving long term problems.

The now threatened rise in unemployment will be especially heavy if we do
not succeed in restraining inflationary wage demands. This makes sensible
policies for helping the regions more vital than ever.

Small Businesses

We want also to help the small, often family-owned businesses which
form the backbone of British enterprise.

They employ a third of workers in the private sector and are immensely
important to the economic life of Britain and to future industrial growth. The
last Conservative government recognised their importance by appointing, for
the first time, a Minister with specific responsibility for small businesses and
by implementing many of the recommendations of the Bolton Committee on
Small Businesses. In the recent Parliament, the Conservative Opposition
won improved tax relief for small businesses which the Labour government
opposed. A new Conservative government will keep under review the profit
levels under which small firms are entitled to relief on corporation tax.

The Impact of Wealth and Gifts Taxes

Small businesses often face the problem of long-term finance. We will
therefore set up an enquiry, to report within twelve months, into the
availability and adequacy of long-term finance for small firms. Small
businesses are also vulnerable to capital taxation and estate duty. The present
government's proposed wealth tax and gifts tax could lead to the break-up of
many small firms and a loss of jobs for those employed in them. In our
overall reform of capital taxation, we will seek to find ways of shielding
small businesses from taxes that might otherwise cripple them, destroy jobs
and harm the economy.

Too many small businesses are being squeezed out of city-centres in
redevelopments. To help prevent this, we will ask all planning authorities to

take into account the social contribution of small shopkeepers and other
small concerns when considering city-centre redevelopments.

Inflation Accounting

There are other areas where we would seek early co-operation with industry.
Inflation at the present rate has a seriously distorting effect on company

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

profitability, given the methods of accounting generally employed in Britain
today. As a result, companies are finding themselves paying taxes on profits
which are to a considerable extent paper profits and do not reflect real
values. This is damaging to the economy since it means a further drain on
funds for investment. The last Conservative government set up the
Sandilands Committee to report and make recommendations on methods of
inflation-accounting. We hope that this Committee will be able to produce its
Report very soon and we will encourage it to do so. As soon as it reports, we
will enter into immediate discussions with industry and the accounting
profession on a changeover to methods of accounting which more accurately
reflect company profitability.

Incentives for Greater Productivity

We also want to consider with industry ways of improving productivity.
There is enormous scope in Britain for doing this, and the impact on our
national prosperity and on that of every family would be considerable. We
shall therefore examine straightaway the possibility of introducing in this
country the sort of national scheme which operates in France for giving a
fair share of the increased profits made by individual firms to those whose
efforts produce improved performance and to those who make their
contribution by investing their savings in new factories and new machinery.

Self-Sufficiency in Energy

The energy industries are specially vital to our economic performance, as
events over the last year have shown. The days of cheap and abundant
energy have gone for good. But Britain is more fortunate than most other
industrial countries in having substantial natural reserves of coal, oil and gas.
There are two clear lessons to be learned from last year's energy crisis: first,
the urgent need to make Britain as self-sufficient in energy as possible;
secondly, to make sure that Britain is able to depend on a variety of different
sources of energy.

Coal

We support the general strategy for coal agreed during 1974 with the
industry. Our aim will be to make the industry viable so that it can provide
an assured and prosperous future for all those who work in it. An important
element will be the establishment of a productivity scheme.

North Sea Oil

In exploiting the oil reserves around the United Kingdom, there are three
essential requirements. First, the British people must retain control of, and
enjoy, the maximum benefits from our off-shore oil. The answer is not to
spend £2,000 million or more of the taxpayers' money in nationalising 51 per
cent of the industry. Nationalisation is inefficient, hugely expensive and
totally unnecessary. The desired results can be achieved just as effectively,

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

and far more cheaply, through taxation and regulation. Taxation will provide
Britain with revenue from the oil. A Conservative government will,
therefore, block the existing corporation tax loopholes and introduce a new
additional tax on North Sea oil profits. At the same time, our proposed new
regulations will give the government all the control that it needs. We will
establish an Oil Conservation Authority to act as a watchdog. Its job will be
to regulate exploration for oil, investment, production and sales in
accordance with general policy directives laid down by the Government.

Scotland and North Sea Oil

Secondly, the Scottish people must enjoy more of the financial benefits from
oil, and they must be given a far greater say over its operation in Scotland.
We will, therefore, establish a Scottish Development Fund. This will provide
immediate cash help to solve the problems created by oil development, but
beyond that it will lay the foundation for Scotland's long4erm economic
prosperity. We will move the Oil Production Division of the Department of
Energy to Scotland and encourage the oil industry to locate their UK
production headquarters in Scotland.

No Delay

Thirdly, we must produce enough oil to meet Britain's needs by 1980. This
means allowing the oil industry to press ahead with the minimum of
hindrance, with the development of our oil resources. Already, the threat of
nationalisation is causing considerable delay in the development of North
Sea oilfields.

Nuclear Power

We will carry through the recently announced pilot programme of nuclear
power stations based on the British designed ‘heavy water' system. We
believe that a larger nuclear programme must be initiated at an early date. In
all nuclear matters, safety and reliability must be our paramount
considerations.

Energy Saving

Events over the last year have highlighted the need for energy conservation.
There is a lot that government can do to help and give a lead, for example by
encouraging adequate home insulation and by giving the necessary support
for research and development. But big savings of energy, which will help the
nation's balance of payments and everyone's pocket, can only be made if the
whole country makes some contribution. People often ask - 'What can we do
to help beat the crisis?' One really useful thing that many of us could do is to
cut down voluntarily on the amount of energy that we use, particularly oil.
We will start urgent talks with every interest - local authorities, industry,
voluntary agencies, consumer groups and so on - with this objective.

People at work

Partnership in Industry

We want to promote partnership between government and industry, and
partnership between those who work together in industry. It is on this that
our chances of overcoming the country's economic difficulties and laying the
foundations of a new prosperity for everyone will depend.

The Law and Industrial Relations

Governments of both parties have tried to establish a new legal framework
within which industrial relations could develop. As we have said elsewhere,
we still believe that our own legislation was soundly based and unfairly
attacked, but in view of the hostility which it aroused we will not reintroduce
it. We accept the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act, introduced by the
present government and sensibly amended by Parliament, as the basis for the
law on trade union organisation and as the legal framework for collective
bargaining. We hope that our decision will help create a better climate for
industrial partnership.

Employeee Participation

To strengthen this partnership, we will lay a formal duty on all large and
medium-sized firms to consult employee representatives on a wide range of
subjects. This is necessary not only for economic reasons but also because a
better understanding is important in its own right. We want to leave the
precise methods and procedures as flexible as possible, but we have it in
mind that the subjects covered should range from disciplinary and dismissal
procedures and redundancy arrangements to consultations about methods of
working, and profit-sharing and share-ownership schemes. These proposals
should lay the foundation for future developments in employee participation
at every level of the enterprise, but it is much too soon to be dogmatic about
the exact form of participation in management.

Much can be learned about the right to consultation at work from the success
achieved by certain companies. The government in particular will need to set
a clear example with its own employees and the nationalised industries will
be expected to play their part.

Other Rights at Work

We will protect and extend other rights of workers, after consultations with
both sides of industry. Our objectives are:

¢ to give employees the right to hold union meetings on the premises
of their employer;

¢ to give union members the opportunity to elect the leaders of their
union by a postal ballot, with adequate help from the government

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

to cover the expense;

e to seek effective ways of providing government assistance for the
training of shop stewards and union officers;

e to seek ways of regulating the conduct of picketing based on the
strict arrangements adopted by the National Union of
Mineworkers in February 1974.

Redundancy Payments

We also believe that the time is now overdue for a review of the system of
payments for redundancy and the arrangements for redundancy in general.
We must take account of developments in Europe, and consider relating
payments to need, linking arrangements for redundancy with arrangements
for industrial retraining, and improving the arrangements for collective
redundancy.

Strikes and the Taxpayer

We believe it is right that the unions themselves should accept a significant
share of the responsibility for the welfare of the families of men who go on
strike, and that the whole burden should not fall on the taxpayer. Equally, it
is right that the families of strikers should not suffer unnecessary hardship.
We will discuss with trade unions and employers how best to meet these two
aims.

Job Satisfaction

Much of the friction in our industrial relations is a symptom of the
frustration and boredom found in many jobs in m9dern industry. The scope
for improving job satisfaction is considerable. The primary responsibility
must rest with management. A Conservative government will accordingly
bring together government, management and the trade unions, to promote
research into ways of improving and extending job satisfaction and to give
advice. This will benefit individual workers, industrial relations in general
and the community at large by improving the tone and atmosphere of our
industrial civilisation.

People and taxes

A Responsible Approach to Taxation

We believe as Conservatives that people should keep as much of what they
earn as is consistent with the responsibility of government to provide
adequate services for the whole community. This is the most practical way to
reward and therefore encourage effort, and it provides the best guarantee of
individual choice and freedom. In present circumstances it would be
irresponsible to promise large reductions in tax rates; and as we said earlier,
if we cannot find the money to pay for additional programmes through
cutting spending on other things it may be necessary to increase some taxes

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 14 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

in the short term. But, as circumstances allow, we shall reduce the burden of
tax on individuals and industry alike, as we have done in the past.

Above all, the tax system must be fair, and be seen to be fair. The last
Conservative government went a long way towards making it fairer. Higher
personal allowances gave proportionately more help to the less well-off
taxpayers. The unified system of income tax brought relief to retired people
living on small investment incomes.

Our proposals for helping older people and low income groups through
personal allowances and the tax credit scheme respectively will be found
later in this Manifesto.

Taxation on Capital

We shall also seek to bring greater fairness into the whole system of taxation
on capital. We do not oppose this in principle - for example, we already have
in this country death duties and capital gains tax. What we do oppose are ill-
considered and damaging additional burdens piled on top of existing penal
and comprehensive taxes. Britain already has higher taxes on both capital
and income than other countries - with a top rate for income tax of 98 per
cent. Tax on tax on tax: this is a prescription, not for a fairer society, but for
a poorer and more bitter one. It is wrong to reform capital taxation in a
piecemeal way without full consideration of the effects. We will examine the
whole system of taxation on capital with the aim of making the system more
fair, less a matter in its application of chance or skill in avoidance, and less
damaging to the thrift, saving and investment on which our future depends.

The last Conservative government raised the starting point for estate duty so
that property passing from husband to wife (or vice versa) is exempt up to
£30,000. An important part of our reform of capital taxation will be to
extend this limit so that no estate duty is payable until the death of the
surviving husband or wife. At present, relations sharing the family home
may be forced to sell it in order to meet estate duties on the death of parents,
brothers or sisters. We shall extend the relief at present enjoyed by widows
or widowers to safeguard the matrimonial home to cover close relatives
living in the same house.

People and rates

People pay tax not only to national government but to local government as
well in the form of rates.

Local authority expenditure has been growing faster than the economy as a
whole. Although on average 60 per cent of this expenditure is met by grant
from the taxpayer, the burden on the domestic ratepayer has risen sharply.
The rating system itself has come under increasing criticism because it does
not reflect people's ability to pay.

Further heavy increases in rates are forecast. In these circumstances

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 15 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39
Conservatives will take the following steps.
Transferring Expenditure

First, we shall transfer to central government in the medium term, the cost of
teachers' salaries up to a specified number of teachers for each local
education authority. Expenditure on police and the fire services will qualify
for increased grants from the Exchequer. We shall see that this saving is
passed on to the ratepayer.

Fairer Taxes

Secondly, within the normal lifetime of a Parliament we shall abolish the
domestic rating system and replace it by taxes more broadly based and
related to people's ability to pay. Local authorities must continue to have
some independent source of finance.

People and their homes

Tackling the nation's housing needs is second only to the fight against
inflation on our agenda.

Two Main Objectives

We have two main objectives. First, we want to see that enough homes are
provided for the families that need them. This means, among other things,
trying to ensure a steady flow of funds for the construction industry and
concentrating help where it is really needed - for example, in the inner city
areas where our proposal for establishing Social Priority Areas (set out in
more detail later) will greatly help.

Secondly, 51 per cent of houses are at present owner-occupied. There are
many families who would like to own their home but for one reason or
another cannot do so. It is our purpose to extend the opportunities for home
ownership to as many of them as possible. The Conservative ideal is a
property-owning democracy.

Mortgage Rates

The first part of our programme for doing this is to reduce the interest rate
charged by building societies to home buyers to 9 per cent and ensure that
it does not rise above that figure.

At the moment, societies have to offer those who are saving money with
them the going interest rate for their investment. Without government action,
any rise in this rate is passed on virtually automatically to the home buyer.
But by varying the rate of tax payable by the building societies (known as
the composite rate) when interest rates in general rise, the Government can
enable the societies to attract sufficient funds without passing on the full

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

increase in the rate to the purchaser. This step will help a// home buyers -
both new buyers and those existing buyers who have to struggle to find the
extra money each month for the increased mortgage repayments for which
they were unprepared.

A number of questions have been raised about the liquidity and reserve
ratios of building societies, the legal restrictions on them, and the possibility
of widening their powers so that they can operate more flexibly. In order to
settle these matters, we shall set up a one year enquiry to sit full4ime and to
make recommendations to the government on the future role and structure of
the societies.

Help with the Deposit

Our second proposal is to give first-time purchasers of private houses
and flats special help in paying the deposit.

We will start a Home Savings Grant Scheme in which people who save
regularly with building societies under schemes approved by the government
will receive a grant proportionate to their savings. The Government will
contribute £1 for every £2 saved up to a given ceiling.

This scheme would take at least two years to mature in order to give builders
sufficient time to increase the supply of homes for sale. Without this, the
extra grant would raise prices since more money would be chasing the same
number of homes.

Several kinds of low start mortgages are already available. We shall
encourage a greater variety of house purchase schemes to fit different
circumstances.

Sale of Council Houses and Flats

Our third proposal for extending home ownership is to give a new deal
to every council tenant who has been in his home for three years or
more. These tenants will have the right to purchase their homes at a
price one-third below market value.

The community will no longer tolerate the attitude of councils which, for
narrow partisan reasons, stand in the way of their tenants becoming
homeowners. We will therefore place a duty on every council to sell homes
on these terms - giving their tenants what amounts to a 100 per cent
mortgage with no deposit. It is of course only right that a tenant who buys
his home should surrender the appropriate portion of any capital gain if he
re-sells it within five years.

Voluntary Housing Movement

We shall support the voluntary housing movement and the Housing
Corporation, both of which have benefited from new measures originally

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

introduced in our Housing and Planning Bill. Housing Associations will
continue to provide dwellings to rent as an alternative to local authorities.

Rents

We will continue the freeze on rents until the end of the year. When we have
examined the reports of the Rent Scrutiny Boards, we will consider how
increases can gradually be implemented in the light of our policies for
fighting inflation. Families in need, whether in furnished or unfurnished
accommodation, will continue to receive help with their rent as provided for
the first time by law under the Conservative Housing Finance Act.

Modernising Older Houses

A policy of maintaining and modernising older houses is often preferable to
demolition and rebuilding. The original scheme for home improvement was
subject to certain abuses but these have now been removed. In all, our
improvement programme resulted in 1 million homes receiving grants under
the last Conservative government. We will continue this programme since it
is exceptionally important to keep our older houses in good condition and to
keep established communities together.

People in retirement

Inflation hits the old and the retired especially hard and in our tax and
social service policies we must do all we can to protect them. And in a
compassionate society they, like people in need, have the right to look
forward to a better standard of living.

Six-Monthly Reviews

We will act first to protect the value of the pension. With prices rising as fast
as they are, annual reviews are too infrequent.

A Conservative government will therefore increase retirement pensions
(as well as other long-term benefits) and public service pensions every
six months.

We will make sure that the burden of paying for improved pensions is fairly
shared. The self-employed in particular should not have to face the huge
increases in contributions proposed by the present government. Our
development of inflation-proofed savings schemes will help those who want
to add to their retirement pension by putting money aside during their
working lives.

Second Pension Scheme

The pension prospects of millions of people in employment have been
damaged by the present government's decision to abandon the Conservative

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 18 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

Second Pension Scheme. Under the Conservative scheme, which was all set
to come into operation, twelve million people would have started building
up a second pension from April 1975. The present government has put a stop
to this. The next Conservative government will reactivate the Second
Pension Scheme to start as soon as possible, and at the latest by April 1976.
With this as a foundation, we shall introduce further improvements, in
particular to make still better second pension provision for women. We will
make sure that married women in employment retain their right not to pay
the full contribution to the State basic scheme.

Higher Personal Allowances for Older People

We recognise the special needs of older people, often trapped by rising
expenses that they cannot escape, and without the opportunity to increase
their incomes as younger people can. Therefore, when we can afford to do
so, we shall introduce higher personal tax allowances for people over 65.
This will give a real rise in after-tax income to many older taxpayers who at
present pay tax at a penal rate of 55 per cent immediately their income
becomes subject to tax.

Abolition of the Earnings Rule

We believe that the earnings rule is socially harmful as well as widely
resented. It discourages able men and women, merely because of their age,
from making a contribution to society which would help both them and the
rest of us. We have relaxed the earnings rule in the past and we will relax it
further. We will abolish it as soon as resources allow.

People in need

Priorities and Inflation

The record of the last Conservative government in giving new help to peopl
in special need was by any reckoning remarkably successful. But rising
standards only highlight the inadequacies that still persist. And inflation
makes them worse. To tackle all these will cost money - and, as we have said
throughout, cash and resources will be severely limited over the next few
years. This underlines the need, greater now than ever, for establishing a
clear set of priorities.

Our first priority in the social services, as we have made clear, is to look
after the pensioners and other families dependent on long-term social
security benefits by reviewing these benefits every six months. This is the
best way of protecting them against rising prices, and it must be our first
task.

The Tax Credit Scheme

The speed at which we can carry out our other main social policies will

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 19 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

depend largely on the economic situation and the resources that become
available. But the centre-piece of our social programme will be the Tax-
Credit scheme - the most advanced anti-poverty programme set in hand by
any western country. This scheme will provide cash help, related to family
circumstances, automatically and without special means test. It will be of
special help to pensioners and to hard-pressed families with low incomes,
especially where there are children. Our intention is to ensure that ultimately
no family in the land need remain in poverty.

Tragically the present government have set their face against this scheme.
We will establish the framework for tax credits as soon as we can and bring
the scheme into effect in stages, as economic circumstances permit.

Child Credits

As a first step towards establishing the tax credit scheme, we will introduce a
system of child credits when economic circumstances allow. These will be
available for all children, including the first child. Child credits will take the
place of the family allowances and tax allowances. The whole of the new
child credits will be payable to mothers in cash in exactly the same way as
existing family allowances, the only difference being that they will be worth
more.

Single-Parent Families

Single-parent families face many financial and social problems, to which the
Finer Report has recently drawn attention. We are studying the Report very
carefully and will take action in the light of its recommendations.

Chronically Sick and Disabled People

One of the particular achievements of the last Conservative government was
to introduce new benefits for chronically ill and severely disabled people.
We shall continue this work. As resources become available, we shall
establish as of right, a new benefit - modest to begin with, but a start - for
those disabled people who have never been able to undertake regular work
and for married women so disabled that they cannot look after their homes
and families. We shall also improve the vehicle service for disabled people
in the light of the Sharp Report: the minimum aim must be to see that all
those who now qualify for 'three wheelers' will be able to exchange them for
cars if they wish to do so.

Earnings Rule
We will relax the earnings rule in relation to supplementary benefit so as
to enable widows to make a real contribution to the living standards of

their families, and we will see that the earnings of children at school are
entirely disregarded.

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

The National Health Service

The National Health Service now faces acute difficulties, which are made all
the worse by the impact of inflation. In present economic circumstances, it
will not be easy even to maintain existing standards. That is why it is so
wrong to reject any acceptable method of channelling additional resources
into Britain's health services. The present government's commitment to scrap
all Health Service charges at a cost of £100 million is bound to make the
problems of the National Health Service worse. For the same reason we
reject the present government's plans for abolishing private practice in
association with the National Health Service. This is unacceptable in
principle; it would also reduce the skills available to patients generally and
would cost nearly £30 million a year. We shall safeguard the right of people
to make provision for their own health and that of their families. What is
now needed in the National Health Service is a period of comparative
stability, founded upon the reorganisation that we carried through, which
must now be allowed to settle down.

On pay there is considerable criticism of the working of the Whitley Council
system in determining salaries and conditions of service in the National
Health Service. We will therefore set up an independent inquiry to make
urgent recommendations for the improvement of the system. A Conservative
government will back-date to last May the recommendations of the Halsbury
Committee on the pay of nurses and related medical professions. But the
problems on pay that have arisen in the National Health Service only
underline the need for a policy to help workers throughout the public sector
to be paid comparable rates of pay to those earned by workers in the private
sector. This may mean channelling more money into wages and salaries, at
the expense of buildings, if we are to avoid a total collapse of the National
Health Service. In this way, for instance, we could implement the principal
recommendations of the Briggs Report on nursing, while preserving the
identity of the health visitor.

Special Needs

There are additional areas requiring special help when the country can afford
it. A Conservative government will give priority to services for old people,
disabled people, mentally ill people, and mentally handicapped people, at
home, in the community and in the hospital. We will build on the record of
the last Conservative Government in providing improved services for deaf
people, and continue to improve the rehabilitation services. We will take
what action may be necessary, in the light of the Report on the death of
Maria Colwell, to detect and prevent the ill-treatment of small children. We
will improve the law relating to adoption following broadly the
recommendations of the Houghton Report.

Voluntary Scoail Service

In implementing our policy of identifying and meeting special need, we will
continue to respect and help the voluntary organisations in their invaluable

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 21 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

work. To this end, we will review the legal framework within which charities
operate, a review that is long overdue. We will also develop the special unit
that we set up when we were in government to help encourage voluntary
service throughout the community.

Women - at home and at work

Child Credits for Mothers

Among those worst hit by the ravages of inflation are mothers, whose house-
keeping money often fails to keep pace with the higher prices in the shops.
Housewives will therefore stand to gain most from the success of our price
stabilisation programme. In addition, as we have already said, we plan as
part of our tax credit scheme to introduce new child credits for all children,
including the first. These will be worth more than the existing family
allowances and will be payable to mothers in cash at the Post Office.

Women at Work

The last Conservative government took steps to ensure the effective
implementation of Equal Pay for women at work by the end of 1975.

We stand by the principle of equal pay for women.
Women in Retirement

Women have had a rough deal over pensions from the present government,
which has abandoned the last Conservative government's Second Pension
Scheme. One of the purposes of this scheme was to improve greatly the
pension prospects for women in employment - enabling many of them to
earn a second pension for the first time and to get a second widow's pension,
also for the first time. A Conservative government will reintroduce the
scheme. We will also maintain the right of women not to pay the full
contribution to the basic State scheme, and retired women who want to do
part-time jobs will of course greatly benefit from our eventual abolition of
the earnings rule.

Widows

In relation to supplementary benefit, we also intend, as we have said, to relax
the earnings rule so as to enable widows to make a real contribution to the
living standards of their families. Widows, as well as separated and deserted
wives, with children to bring up, will benefit from the action we take in the
light of the Finer Report.

The Right of a Woman to be Treated Equally

The last Conservative government made considerable progress in

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 22 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

strengthening women's rights. In pensions, social benefits, taxation,
maintenance payments and guardianship of children, we introduced a
succession of new rights for women. We also announced our intention to set
up an Equal Opportunities Commission, the biggest single step towards a
society of real equality for men and women taken by any government since
women won the vote. Only the timing of the election prevented its
implementation. We remain committed to setting up an Equal Opportunities
Commission with powers to enquire into areas of discrimination and to
report to the Government on the need for future action.

Children, parents and schools

The Quality of Education

Many parents are deeply worried about the quality of the education which
their children receive - in particular about standards of learning, conduct and
discipline. These problems have accumulated over the years in an
atmosphere over-charged with politics. Too often, the debate over education
has centred on the kind of school rather than on the quality of the education
provided; and too few parents have been allowed any real say over their
children's education.

Children's Needs Must Come First

The Conservative approach towards education is clear and distinct. Our
overriding concern is with the educational needs of the children.

Our first objective will therefore be to preserve good schools of whatever
kind. We are in no way against comprehensive schools: what we oppose is
the ruthless imposition of these schools, regardless of local needs and in
defiance of parents' wishes. Typical of this approach is Labour's circular,
which hits the building programmes of local authorities which have not gone
comprehensive. The next Conservative government will withdraw this. We
will expect local authorities to make their schemes of reorganisation
sufficiently flexible to include grammar and direct grant schools of proven
worth. This will help to meet the needs of bright and able children,
especially those from disadvantaged areas. We will scrutinise zoning
arrangements to ensure that they do not restrict or eliminate choice.

The eleven-plus examination is arbitrary. But selection where necessary
must be flexible so as to allow the transfer of children from one school to
another at a variety of ages.

Raising Standards

We must take speedy action to raise standards of teaching and education.
This will involve a considerable strengthening of the system of schools
inspection. More inspectors will need to be recruited. National standards of

reading, writing and arithmetic will be set. And the training period for

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 23 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

teachers should give more attention to teaching the three basic skills and
how to maintain discipline.

Comprehensive Schools

Comprehensive schools have been a continuing source of controversy. This
controversy should be settled by a fair and dispassionate examination of
their performance, their size and their structure. A Conservative government
will set up such an enquiry, as a matter of urgency, to report speedily.

Direct Grant Schools

The direct grant schools are particularly valuable. They combine high
academic standards with a wide social mix. The present government is
currently examining ways of destroying these schools. A Conservative
government will instead strengthen them by re-opening the direct grant list,
by considering the introduction of a complete system of assisted places so
that every parent pays only according to his or her means, and-when
economic circumstances allow us to do so - by raising the capitation grants
to take account of increased costs.

The School-Leaving Age

Since the raising of the school-leaving age, the problems of truancy and
indiscipline have become more acute. We remain committed to the principle
of education up to sixteen, but believe that it should be applied more
flexibly. One possibility, which we will want to examine closely, is to allow
children of fifteen the opportunity of taking up an apprenticeship or training
as a first step towards taking a job.

A Charter of Parents' Rights

An important part of the distinct Conservative policy on education is to
recognise parental rights. A say in how their children are to be brought up is
an essential ingredient in the parental role. We will therefore introduce
additional rights for parents.

First, by amending the 1944 Education Act, we will impose clear obligations
on the State and local authorities to take account of the wishes of parents.
Second, we will consider establishing a local appeal system for parents
dissatisfied with the allotment of schools. Third, parents will be given the
right to be represented on school boards-by requiring a substantial
proportion of the school governors and managers to be drawn from, and
elected by, the parents of children currently at school. Fourth, we will place
an obligation on all head teachers to form a parent-teachers association to
assist and support teachers. Fifth, we will encourage schools to publish
prospectuses about their record, existing character, specialities and
objectives.

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

Teachers

Better standards in schools will mean raising the status of the teaching
profession. We will consider sympathetically the recommendations of Lord
Houghton's Committee on Teachers! Salaries. As steps towards raising the
professional status of teachers, we will encourage the movement to an all
graduate profession, the implementation of the recommendations of the
James Report on In-service Training and the establishment of a professional
council for teachers to regulate their own affairs. We will also stimulate local
authorities to provide houses for teachers where this is necessary.

Tasks for the Future

For the moment, we cannot afford as a country to do all the things we want
for children and young people - in their schools, colleges and universities.
But when we have got on top of our present economic difficulties we will
complete the work we have started for the younger children-replacing and
modernising old primary schools (especially in the rundown areas of our
towns and cities), developing further the pre-school facilities for children,
and helping handicapped children. We will also want to ease the financial
problems faced by our universities and see that teachers in polytechnics,
with the same qualifications as those at universities, receive the same
salaries. In addition our aim will be to finance the polytechnics and colleges
of education in a similar way to the universities.

Young people

Young people want many of the same things as their parents-a decent home
to start married life in, the opportunity to earn a rising standard of living, a
fair reward for what they do, a decent environment, the chance to go as far
as their abilities will take them. But the problems that are special to young
people are not being adequately dealt with by central and local government.

The Need for Co-Ordination

We therefore think that it is time to establish a special unit to co-ordinate the
actions of government departments as they affect the needs and aspirations
of young people.

Youth and Community Bill

We will re-introduce the Youth and Community Bill, which, among other
things, provides local reviews of existing arrangements in the field of
housing, employment, leisure and advice services as they relate to young

people.

Housing

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 25 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

We will give special help to first-time house buyers as we have said in more
detail earlier. We should also recognise that young people working in our
cities are more mobile and have a special housing need which has been
aggravated by the actions of the present government in introducing the Rent
Act. We will encourage the voluntary housing movement to provide
accommodation in inner city areas which will meet their needs. We will also
encourage the growth of hostel accommodation and student co-operative
dwellings. Local authorities should consider the needs of young people in
planning their housing provision.

Employment

The youth employment service has over the years provided invaluable help
to thousands of school leavers. But too many young people still receive
inadequate guidance in choosing their first job and insufficient help with the
difficult move from school to work. We will accordingly undertake a review
of the youth employment service in order to strengthen it and make it even
more responsive to the needs of young people. We will also examine ways of
improving the co-ordination of vocational guidance services in general,
including the Manpower Services Commission, the adult occupational
guidance unit, and the careers service profession. We want to see more
young people in their last year at school given the opportunity to try out
prospective jobs with the help and participation of local industries. For those
in need of special help and support we will expand the Community
Industries Scheme.

Community Service

Most young people wish to have a greater say in the decisions affecting their
lives, and many also wish to give service to the community. It is important to
see that they are given opportunities to serve on bodies which influence daily
life, particularly where the Government itself makes the appointments.

The young in urban communities are subject to special stresses. Those with
immigrant parents may have additional problems because of the cultural
differences between their family life and the society they live in. We will use
the urban aid and community development programmes to support
cooperative schemes, involving local authorities, voluntary agencies and the
communities themselves.

Students

When we review student grants, we will reduce the amount that parents have
to contribute and we will end the discrimination against married women
students. It is unfair that, while some students can get a grant as of right
from a local authority, other students only get a grant if the local authority
chooses to give one. As soon as economic circumstances allow, we will
review the present arrangements with the aim of ending these unfairnesses in
the provision of grants. We will encourage the formation of student housing
associations.

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

People and their environment

For some unfortunate people environment means the slum they live in or the
slag heap which looms at the bottom of their garden. For others it means
stricter controls over pollution or conserving the world's finite resources;
clearing more derelict land or encouraging family planning; giving more
people the chance to go to concerts and galleries or raising the quality of
broadcasting. The term covers a whole complex of questions which in one
way or another affect the quality of our lives. Our approach to these
problems as Conservatives is based on our belief that many things should be
conserved, and on our belief in the dignity of the individual. We do not
accept that, by becoming more prosperous, we will destroy the quality of our
environment. We believe, to the contrary, that properly controlled and
directed growth can and will improve the environment, not least of those
who at present have too low a standard of living to enjoy many of the good
things of life.

Building on Our Record

In 1970 we set up the first Department of the Environment in the world and
became world leaders in a policy to protect the environment when it was
good and to improve it when it had been spoilt or polluted. We will build on
our record by:

¢ leading a determined, properly co-ordinated effort on a national scale
to make far greater progress in the recycling of waste products;

¢ carrying through the drive to clear derelict land;

¢ pressing on with measures to prevent pollution of all kinds, and
improving the methods for monitoring potentially dangerous matter;

e seeking methods of avoiding waste and unnecessary consumption of
fuels and energy, for example, by helping to raise the standards of
house insulation.

Family Planning

The last Conservative government appointed the Population Panel and for
the first time provided a complete family planning service within the
National Health Service. We believe that it is the responsibility of
government to provide such a service and to tell people the facts about our
population. But we must leave it to every family to decide what use to make
of the family planning service.

Transport

We want to preserve a proper balance between the interests of road and rail
transport and between those of the private motorists and public transport. We
will re-introduce our plans to modify the bus licensing system so as to give
greater freedom for new forms of local transport in country areas. We will
also extend the establishment of a system of lorry routes to keep heavy

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 27 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

vehicles out of towns and villages and away from narrow country lanes. We
will naturally continue to take all possible steps to diminish noise and other
nuisances caused by new roads and the traffic which uses them, and also to

improve road safety wherever possible.

Towns and Cities

There are still parts of Britain, especially the inner city areas, which suffer
acute squalor and deprivation-poor housing, dilapidated schools, substandard
social and welfare services and a general lack of amenities. It is not
surprising that these conditions have led to an increase in juvenile crime and
vandalism.

What is needed is a major concentration of help in these areas, brought
together in an effectively co-ordinated programme. We will first ask local
authorities, in consultation with voluntary organisations, to propose Social
Priority Areas. Our aim will then be to bring about a major transformation in
these areas, by improving housing conditions, replacing or improving out-
dated schools and building up the local social services and amenities. We
will give more opportunity for local people to play a greater part in the
affairs of their community. In particular we will make sure that more tenants
are involved in running their council estates.

Advice Centres

People are frequently unaware of their rights as citizens. They often find
themselves being passed from one office to another receiving only
discouragement. To help meet this problem we will set up advice centres, in
partnership with the independent voluntary agencies which are already
making a useful contribution.

Better Race Relations

In many urban areas, in particular, social harmony depends on the white and
the coloured communities living and working together on equal terms and
with equal opportunities. A Conservative government will pursue positive
policies to promote good race relations. This means, among other things,
seeking remedies for the problems faced by coloured people, especially
adolescents, in employment and in education (for example, in the teaching of
the English language). The Government must take the lead and set an
example, but local authorities, employers, trade unionists and voluntary
organisations have an important part to play.

Strict Immigration Control
Better community relations, however, depend also on reassuring people that
immigration is being kept down to the minimum. In the interests of good

race relations, and for the benefit of immigrants already in Britain, as well as
for the wider community, a Conservative government will follow a policy of

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 28 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

strictly limited immigration. Abuse of immigration control is unfair,
particularly to immigrants who have arrived lawfully. While honouring
commitments already made, we will discuss with the representatives of the
immigrant communities steps to be taken against abuse. In all our policies
our aim will be to keep in the closest touch with the immigrant communities.

Nationality Law

We shall carry forward the review of British nationality law. Dependent on
its outcome, new legislation may be required in the life of the next
Parliament.

The Arts, Sport and Broadcasting

At a time when economic conditions necessarily impose limits on public
spending, we will nevertheless continue to give as much help as we can to
the arts, to sport and to broadcasting, and we will be particularly keen to
encourage local effort and involvement. As we have promised before, we
will introduce legislation to establish a Public Lending Right for authors.

People in Scotland and Wales

A recurring theme in our programme is the need to recognise that people
want more freedom and more control over their own lives. This is what has
shaped our policies for Scotland and Wales.

In Scotland we will:

* set up a Scottish Assembly;

¢ give the Secretary of State for Scotland, acting with the Scottish
Assembly, the power to decide how to spend Scotland's share of the
UK budget;

¢ establish a Scottish Development Fund, as stated earlier, to provide
substantial help with both the new problems created by oil, and with
Scotland's old deprived areas;

¢ transfer the Oil Division of the Department of Energy to Scotland.

In Wales, we will:

* increase the powers and the functions of the Secretary of State for
Wales and ensure that Wales' share of the UK budget is spent in
accordance with decisions taken in Wales and the Welsh Office;

¢ establish a new Select Committee of Welsh MPs entitled to meet in
Cardiff as well as at Westminster;

¢ strengthen the functions of the Welsh Council and reconstitute its
membership so that the majority will be elected from the new County
and District Councils.

In Scotland and Wales we are publishing separate manifestos, setting out
these plans and others in more detail.

People in Northern Ireland

Our troops are still heavily engaged in Northern Ireland. They have carried
out their difficult and dangerous task with superb courage, discipline, and
skill. No other body of men in the world could have done so well. But the
more police duties can be carried out by the police, the more we can reduce
the strain on the Army, and the more soldiers we can withdraw from Ulster.

Yet it would be fatal to withdraw the Army before its work is done. And
while our troops are risking their lives, they must have the support of the
necessary emergency powers.

We recognise that Ulster is at present under-represented at Westminster, but
obviously any change in that representation must await an agreement on the
future devolution of government in Northern Ireland.

The next Conservative government, like the last, will work for peace and
consent in Northern Ireland. There can be no military solution without a
political solution that is fair to both the majority and the minority
communities. Equally there can be no political solution unless terrorism is
curbed and the law is respected and upheld by all. There must be partnership
between the communities. We will seek the closest co-operation with the
Republic, but Ulster is, of course, part of the United Kingdom.

People and the law

The Law Under Attack

Through the centuries, the law in Britain has acted as the defence of the
small man against the great, of the weak against the strong. If we cannot
depend on the protection of the law, enacted by the free Parliament of a free
people and enforced impartially between one man and another, then our
security and our freedoms alike are without foundation. In a world of
growing turbulence, individuals more than ever need the law's protection
against the might of the powerful and irresponsible. But recently the law has
been under attack, and those attacks have all too often been condoned and
even endorsed by members and supporters of the present Government.
Respect for the law cannot be selective.

At a time when there are too many people prepared to take the law into

their own hands, a Conservative government, backed by public opinion,
will uphold the rule of law. Without law, there can be no freedom.

Strengthening the Police

We will need to take vigorous action to deal with the lawlessness and the
growth of terrorism which confront us in the 1970s.

The new Conservative government will strengthen the police force, our

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

principal defenders against internal attack.

We will improve the career prospects throughout the whole police service, to
provide greater incentives for policemen to remain in the force until
retirement. We will launch a new recruitment drive to increase the numbers
of Special Constables who can play an invaluable role in supporting the
regular police. We support the introduction of an independent element into
the procedure for investigating complaints against the police.

Young Offenders

A strengthened police force will be in the forefront of the continuing battle
against crime. But additional measures are needed to tackle the growth in
crime committed by young persons, especially in our towns and cities. The
Children and Young Persons Act of 1969 is now in need of review and
amendment. The courts must be enabled to deal more effectively with
persistent juvenile offenders-for example, football hooligans-and the range
of available institutions must be improved. We need more community homes
providing both secure accommodation and an environment for encouraging
young offenders to become useful members of the community. All these
steps will help to prevent today's young apprentices in crime from becoming
tomorrow's professional criminals.

Crime Prevention at the Roots

A Conservative government will review fines, taking account of the change
in the value of money and of trends in sentencing. We will pursue the policy
we started of dealing with offenders in the community when it is both
possible and sensible to do so. Our programme for channelling additional
help and resources into the deprived areas of our cities and towns will also,
by creating a better environment, play a valuable part in combating crime at
the roots. We will further strengthen and expand the probation service.

Processions and Demonstrations

We will review the Public Order Act 1936 to ensure that it is adequate for
the control of processions and demonstrations.

Protecting People from Indecent Display
The growing display of indecent material in public places gives offence to
many people. Accordingly, we will reintroduce our Bill to prohibit this and

to tighten up the law against sending through the post unsolicited matter of
an indecent nature.

Redress Against Officialdom

In the complex and powerful modern State, control of administrative
decisions that can adversely affect the individual has become increasingly

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 31 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

important. There have been some valuable recent developments in Britain
such as the spread of the Ombudsman system. But we believe our legal
structure still needs further reform in order to strengthen its power to defend
the citizen aggrieved by the State. We will pursue reform of administrative
law in the light of our experience of the extended Ombudsman system and of
the forthcoming proposals of the Law Commission.

Law Reform

The framework of freedom and civilised life is the law. All our daily
activities are dependent on it. We propose to give a high priority to keeping
the law clear and up to date. Law reform may seem a dull subject but it does
affect the rights of all of us. Here are some examples of needed reforms.

Needed Reforms

Our extradition laws, based on a century-old statute, are cumbersome, out of
date, and in some conditions unworkable. We also need to reform the
licensing laws taking into account public reactions to the Erroll Report. The
law on compensation for personal injury needs attention and is at the
moment being studied by a Royal Commission. The law affecting 'squatters'
has been shown to be inadequate. Finally the drafting of our laws frequently
lacks clarity, and this means that they are inaccessible and are difficult to
interpret. We propose to secure greater simplicity and clarity in statute law in
the light of the forthcoming report of the Renton Committee on the
Preparation of Legislation.

Improving Justice

When in office we substantially improved the machinery of justice. We will
continue to do so and will review the machinery and jurisdiction of
Magistrates' Courts in the light of the forthcoming James Report. When the
economic situation permits, we favour the phased extension of Legal Aid to
proceedings before Tribunals on certain defined principles.

Privacy and Official Secrets

When in office we implemented some of the Younger Report's
recommendations on privacy (for example, on the secrecy of people's credit
ratings) and were working on further aspects of it. We were also working on
the security implications of the Franks Report. When returned to office, we
will take up the unfinished work and present the country with further firm
proposals.

Speaker's Conference on Electoral Reform
In a democracy, it is essential that Parliament and our parliamentary
institutions should enjoy the confidence of the people. That is why, for

example, we have brought forward plans for giving people in Scotland and

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 32 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

Wales a greater say in running their own affairs.

But confidence in Parliament has been strained by two developments. First,
there have been the attempts by industrial monopolies and others to do as
they want, regardless of the democratically expressed will of the people, and
of the actions of a democratically elected government. Second, there have
been those who have questioned whether our electoral system ensures that
Parliament and the legislation it passes reflect the wishes of the people. We
will propose the establishment of a Speaker's Conference to examine our
electoral system and to make recommendations. In addition to considering
our present voting system and alternatives, we would like the Speaker's
Conference to examine the question of representation in the European
Parliament, which many people think should be decided by direct election.

The British people and the world

Defending Britain

We live in dangerous times. As much as in the past Britain must be able to
defend herself and her way of life. To us, aggressive war may be
unthinkable. To some other countries, it is an acceptable way of gaining their
ends. Now we face the ever increasing danger of both national and
international terrorism. In these circumstances the national interest demands
the maintenance of adequate defence forces. Moreover, we must take all
necessary steps to protect our energy supplies in the North Sea.

The NATO Alliance

Throughout the last few years the Soviet armed forces in the West have
continued to grow and there has been a vast expansion of the Russian navy.
Unquestionably the NATO alliance, which has provided peace in Europe for
25 years, remains crucial to our security, and so the Conservative Party
believes that Britain should continue to play a leading role within the
alliance. We shall see that Britain's nuclear deterrent remains effective.

Efficiency and Morale

The efficiency and high morale of the armed forces, which has been so
outstandingly demonstrated in Northern Ireland is of paramount importance.
We must improve conditions of service for those who make the defence of
this country their career. We will take action to tackle the difficulties which
have arisen in the provision of housing for servicemen at the completion of
their regular service. We will maintain the efficiency and improve the
equipment of the Reserve Forces which play a vital role in the preservation
of Britain's security.

Britain and the World

Conservative foreign policy has always had two main objectives: first, to

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 33 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

maintain the security of Britain and the protection of British interests; and,
secondly, playing our full part in the Commonwealth, to gain as many
friends and allies in the international community as possible. Such a policy
contributes to stability throughout the world. It also creates the necessary
conditions for the expansion of our trade.

Conservative Achievements in Foreign Policy

The last Conservative government helped to strengthen NATO, but we also
promoted the process of détente. We played a leading part in the Conference
of Security and Co-operation in Europe. We opened Ministerial talks with
the Peoples' Republic of China. We greatly improved our relations with the
countries of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf.

The Common Market

But by far the most historic achievement of the last Conservative
government was to bring about British entry into the European Community.
Membership of the EEC brings us great economic advantages, but the
European Community is not a matter of accountancy. There are two basic
ideas behind the formation of the Common Market; first, that having nearly
destroyed themselves by two great European civil wars, the European
nations should make a similar war impossible in future; and, secondly, that
only through unity could the Western European nations recover control over
their destiny - a control which they had lost after two wars, the division of
Europe and the rise of the United States and the Soviet Union.

All recent governments of this country have concluded that membership of
the community is essential for British interests. These decisions were not
lightly taken. They were preceded by prolonged study of the facts. The terms
secured by the last Conservative government were supported by those
members of the previous Labour government most qualified to judge them.
The country's long term interests should not now be sacrificed to short term
party interests.

The Dangers of Withdrawal

An overwhelming majority of British exporters and businessmen favour our
membership of the Common Market. The Community provides an enormous
home market for our industries and membership of the biggest trading bloc
in the world. Just as we need military allies, so we need political and
economic allies. British withdrawal would mean the abandonment of export
opportunities, the decline of industrial development in this country and the
loss of jobs. Withdrawal would give us less power and influence in the world
not more. Withdrawal would confront us with the choice of almost total
dependence on others or retreat into weak isolation. We reject such a bleak
and impotent future for Britain.

Negotiation

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Oct/october-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 34 of 35

October 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

Within the Community, there is a continuous process of negotiation in order
to take account of the interests of Britain and to deal with the problems of
the community as a whole. This process will go on: it ensures that no
member state carries an unfair burden. We will present the results of
negotiation to Parliament at every stage in accordance with Britain's
constitutional practice.

Conservatives have been playing their full part in the European Parliament
to protect British interests, improve Community policy and make Europe
more democratic. A central part of future Conservative policy will be to
work realistically for closer European unity in all the areas of Community
policy which can be of benefit to Britain. In this way we can make our
contribution to a peaceful, prosperous and democratic Europe.

Europe gives us the opportunity to reverse our political and economic
decline. It may be our last.

February 1974 Conservative Party
General Election Manifesto

Firm Action for a Fair Britain

Today we face great dangers both from within our own country and from
outside. The problems are formidable, but there is no reason why they
should overwhelm us.

The assets of the British people are great. Not simply our technical skills and
our natural resources, but also, more important than these, the strength and
stability of our institutions and the determination of our people in moments
of crisis to ensure that good sense and moderation prevail.

If we are to make the best use of those assets it is essential that the affairs of
this country are in the hands of a strong government, able to take firm
measures in defence of the national interest.

This means a Conservative Government with a renewed mandate from the
people and with a full five years in which to guide the nation safely through
the difficult period that lies ahead.

That is why we need a General Election now.
Once the General Election is behind us then we must put aside our

differences and join in a common determination to establish and maintain a
secure, civilised fair society.

The Danger from Outside

The world has changed dramatically since we last sought the support of the
electorate.

In the last two years there has been a dramatic rise in the world price of
almost all the essential raw materials and foods which we have to import
from overseas.

Many of these prices have doubled in the past year alone, making it
impossible to stem the rise in the cost of living.

Now on top of these increases comes the huge increase in oil prices, which

in turn will affect the cost of almost everything that we produce or buy in
this country.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

Fortunately, as far as energy is concerned, Britain will in the long run be able
to cope better than most. We have plentiful supplies of coal and natural gas.
We are well advanced in the development of nuclear power. Above all,
within five years from now we should be able to satisfy the greater part of
our needs with our own oil from the seas around our shores, provided we
make the determined effort that will be necessary.

But let no one suppose that as a nation we can deal with the immediate
problem without hardship and sacrifice.

It will impose a greatly increased burden on our balance of payments, and
for the time being will make us poorer as a nation than we would otherwise
have been.

What we must continue to ensure is that any sacrifices are shared equitably
and that hardship does not fall on those least able to bear it.

If the situation requires further action - whether it be in the field of public
expenditure or of tax or monetary policies - we shall not hesitate to take it.

But the basis of our firm action will be fairness.
The Danger from Within

Events from overseas have held us back. They will not destroy us.

What could destroy, not just our present standard of living but all our hopes
for the future, would be inflation we brought upon ourselves.

Despite the unprecedented sharp rise in world prices, price increases in the
shops have, as a result of our counter-inflation policies, been much less than
would otherwise have been the case.

We have also made sure that those worst hit by rising prices, in particular
pensioners, are better protected than they have ever been before.

But we have also had to deal with the inflation which comes as a result of
excessive wage increases here at home.

For more than two years we tried strenuously to deal with this problem by
voluntary means. In particular we asked trade unions and employers to join
us in working out a voluntary scheme to prevent one group of workers using
its industrial strength to steal a march over those working in other industries.

Then other groups are inevitably provoked into leapfrogging. And so it goes
on, with the old, the weak and those who do not or will not strike, suffering
more at each turn of the inflationary screw.

In the end, after all our talks, although we agreed on objectives, the trade

unions could not agree with us on a voluntary means of achieving them, and
we had to ask Parliament for statutory powers over pay and prices to hold

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

the line against inflation.
Stages | and 2 of that policy, which are now completed, proved more
successful than our critics thought possible. The rise in prices due to internal

causes was sharply reduced - to a greater extent, indeed, than in most other
countries.

Now, in Stage 3 nearly six million workers have concluded wage agreements
within the approved limits. The special position of the mineworkers has been
recognised by an offer, within Stage 3, of a size which few other groups of
workers can hope to achieve.

It is a tragedy that the miners' leaders should have turned down this offer.

The action taken by the National Union of Mineworkers has already caused
great damage and threatens even greater damage for the future.

It must be the aim of any responsible Government to reach a settlement of
this dispute at the earliest possible moment.

The choice before the Government, and now the choice before the country, is
clear.

On the one hand it would be possible to accept the NUM's terms for a
settlement.

The country must realise what the consequences of this would be.

It would mean accepting the abuse of industrial power to gain a privileged
position.

It would undermine the position of moderate trade union leaders.

It would make it certain that similar strikes occurred at frequent intervals in
the future.

It would destroy our chances of containing inflation.

The alternative is to reach a settlement with the NUM on terms which safe
guard the nation's interests as well as the miners.

The basis of that settlement must be fairness.

The terms must be fair to the miners, but they must also be fair to the nearly
six million workers who have now accepted settlements within the limits of
our counter-inflation policy and the many others who are prepared to do so.
They must be fair to the even greater number of people who have no union
to stand up for them and who rely on the elected government to look after

their interests.

A Conservative Government with a new mandate and five years of certain

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

authority ahead of it would be in a good position to reach such a settlement.

The present offer by the National Coal Board remains on the table. It can be
accepted at any time.

We have accepted the principles of the Pay Board's report on relative rates of
pay between one group of workers and another. We have already set up
machinery for the examination of major claims about relative pay levels,
based on the Pay Board.

As its first task, this new machinery will conduct a full examination of the
miners' case within this framework. It will take due account of the relative
claims of other groups, many of whom - such as nurses and teachers - gave
evidence during the preparation of the Relativities Report. Moreover, we are
prepared to undertake that whatever recommendation the new body makes
on the miners' case can be backdated to the first of March.

It will be completely free to take evidence from any quarter and to decide
upon its recommendations.

So it will be impartial and it will be thorough.
And it will be fair, not only to the miners, but to everyone else.

But whatever settlement is reached, the fact must be faced that, for a time,
our nation's resources will be stretched to the limit, and those most in need
of protection against inflation must have first claim on them.

This Conservative Government has already moved from a two-yearly to an
annual review of pensions and all other benefits. We will now move to a six
monthly up-rating of pensions and other long-term benefits.

This will have to be paid for by the community as a whole, out of higher
contributions which must be shared fairly amongst all the people.

A fair and orderly policy for pay and prices, for pensions and benefits meets
the economic needs of the country.

But at the same time, it must be matched by a fair and orderly way of
dealing with our industrial relations.

The foundations for better relations in industry were laid in the Industrial
Relations Act. We have never pretended that it would be easy to implement.

But other industrial countries have found that good industrial relations
require a proper framework of law and we are sure that Britain is no
exception.

We shall therefore maintain the essential structure of the Industrial Relations

Act, but we shall amend it in the light of experience, and after consultation
with both sides of industry, in order

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

¢ to meet any valid criticisms

¢ to make conciliation a pre-condition of court action

¢ and to provide more effective control for the majority of union
members by ensuring that they have the opportunity to elect the
governing bodies and national leaders of their unions by a postal
ballot.

We shall also seek to improve industrial relations by bringing in new
legislation, following discussions with both sides of industry, designed to
make large and medium-sized firms introduce a wider measure of employee-
participation.

The best way of curbing the majority of extremists in the trade unions is for
the moderate majority of union members to stand up and be counted.

But the fact remains that a small number of militant extremists can so
manipulate and abuse the monopoly power of their unions as to cause
incalculable damage to the country and to the fabric of our society itself.

Moreover, it is manifestly unfair that those who do not go on strike are, in
effect, obliged to subsidise those who do.

It is no part of our policy to see the wives and children of men on strike
suffering.

But it is only right that the unions themselves, and not the taxpayer, should
accept their primary responsibility for the welfare of the families of men
who choose to go on strike; and, after discussions with trade unions and
employers. we will amend the social security system accordingly.

The General Election that is now upon us is a chance for the British people
to show the world that at a time of crisis the overwhelming majority of us
are determined not to tear ourselves apart, but to close ranks.

It is a chance, in other words, to demonstrate that we believe in ourselves as
a nation.

This is our aim:

¢ a Britain united in moderation, not divided by extremism a society in
which there is change without revolution

¢ a Government that is strong in order to protect the weak

* a people who enjoy freedom with responsibility

¢ amorality of fairness without regimentation

¢ anation with faith in itself, and a people with self-respect.

We are a great nation, with a long and eventful history behind us.

We have survived grave perils in the past, and we can do so again now. But
to do so, two things are needed, as they have always been: a united people,
prepared to put aside our differences to fight the common threat; and a

strong Government, able to do whatever is necessary to carry out the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39
people's will.

In the pages that follow we set out our record over the four years since we
were voted into office, our proposals for the future, and the nature of the
choice now facing the nation.

Although we have not been able to do as much as we would have liked, and
the problems which face us are immense, the record of the progress we have
made so far, despite all the difficulties, both national and international, that
have beset us, is important in two ways.

First, looking back, it provides a fair basis for a comparison with the record
of our predecessors. Second, looking ahead, the achievements of the past
four years provide the solid foundation for our further progress once the
present difficulties are overcome.

Until the present crisis hit the country, the living standards of the British
people, since we took office in 1970, had been rising more than twice as fast
as they did during the period of the former Labour administration. One of
the cruellest consequences of inflation is the unfair way in which it hits some
groups in the community far harder than others. But despite the hardship
caused by rising prices, for the great majority of the people of this country,
the pronounced rise in living standards was a reality; and with the expansion
of the nation's economy came a welcome restoration of Britain's strength in
the world.

This prosperity has now, for the time being, been blighted by the effects of
the three-day week, forced upon us by the need to ration electricity so as to
prevent our power stations from running out of coal altogether as a
consequence of the industrial action taken by the National Union of
Mineworkers.

And even when the need for the three-day week is over, we must still, for
some time to come, and in common with many other countries, expect a
pause in the rise in our living standards; since, for the time being, all the
extra national wealth created will be needed to pay for the higher cost of
essential imports, notably oil, and will not, therefore, be available for
increased prosperity at home.

This obviously has particular implications for those of our programmes and
objectives which necessarily involve substantial Government expenditure,
where everything is dependent on the economic resources available. Here
the crisis makes it more essential than ever to avoid easy but irresponsible
promises beyond what the country can at present afford. We have, therefore,
undertaken a full and realistic review of all our policies in the light of the
changed conditions faced by the Western world as a whole. As a result, in
framing our specific proposals, we have concentrated on indicating what our
priorities in the next Parliament will be; on outlining, in each field, those
programmes that will be given first claim in present economic
circumstances.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

But while this means that the next year or two will inevitably be arduous and
difficult, further ahead, provided we work together as one nation and stand
firm against inflation, we can look forward to an economy more soundly
based than we have known since the war, thanks to the increasing
availability of North Sea oil. In addition to going a long way towards solving
the energy crisis, this promises radically to transform our balance of
payment position.

Meanwhile, during the difficult period that lies ahead, we shall continue to
take special care to protect the pensioners, the lower paid, and those in need.

It may be that we are able to do more than is promised in this manifesto.
That will depend, in part, on world economic forces beyond our control; but,
more than anything else, it will depend on our ability to work together as one
nation and on the extent of our success in winning the vitally important
battle against inflation. Meanwhile, at this critical time in our nation's affairs,
we believe it to be right to err on the side of caution; to promise too little
rather than too much.

Beyond this, however, there is something that no crisis can change or slow
down. That is our vision of the Britain in which we believe, the ideal which
will inform all that we do.

A Britain united in moderation, not divided by extremism. A society in which
there is change without revolution. A Government that is strong in order to
protect the weak. A people who enjoy freedom with responsibility. A morality
of fairness without regimentation. A nation with faith in itself, and a people
with self-respect.

Holding the Line Against Inflation

Our consistent aim since taking office has been, and remains, to safeguard
and enhance the well-being of the British people.

Throughout that period, and never more so than today, the gravest threat to
our national well-being has been the menace of unrestrained inflation.

This was a legacy we inherited from our predecessors. In our 1970 Election
Manifesto, we pledged that 'we will give overriding priority to bringing the
present inflation under control’, but warned that 'the Labour Government's
policies have unleashed forces which no Government could hope to reverse
over night’.

We reduced Labour's rates of indirect taxation, which bore directly on prices.
We made unprecedented efforts to obtain the co-operation of trade unions
and employers in formulating an effective voluntary pay and prices policy.
When agreement on this proved impossible, we sought and obtained the
consent of Parliament to control pay, prices and profits by law.

But our warning that the battle against inflation would not be quickly or
easily won has proved even truer than we feared at the time. For on top of all

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

the problems we inherited, we have had to absorb an unprecedented rise in
the world prices of almost all the essential foods and raw materials that we
are obliged to import from overseas. It is this, and not membership of the
Common Market, which has led to the substantial rise in the price of food in
the shops.

When we took office nearly four years ago, prices were not merely rising
alarmingly: the rate of increase was steadily accelerating. As a result of our
policies so far, we have been able to reduce the rise in prices due to internal
causes and, therefore, within our own control as a nation.

But the rate at which prices are rising is still dangerously high, and on top of
everything else we now have to absorb a four-fold increase in the price of
oil. This makes it all the more vital that we hold the line against inflation
caused by excessive wage settlements at home.

We shall, therefore, press ahead with the pay and prices policy, if necessary
stiffening it in the light of the developing economic situation.

We shall ensure that the Price Commission has the powers it needs to protect
the consumer from unnecessary price rises, and we will examine further
means of controlling the rise in prices of key items of food in the household
budget.

We shall renew our offer to the TUC and CBI to join us in working out an
effective voluntary pay and prices policy, ultimately to replace the existing
statutory policy, in the management and evolution of which both sides of
industry would jointly participate.

Meanwhile, however, it is manifestly unfair that those who do not go on
strike are, in effect, obliged to subsidise those who do. It is no part of our
policy to see the wives and children of men on strike suffering. But it is only
right that the unions themselves, and not the taxpayer, should accept their
primary responsibility for the welfare of the families of men who choose to
go on strike; and after discussions with trade unions and employers, we will
amend the social security system accordingly.

Beating the Energy Crisis

Well before the current oil crisis emerged in the aftermath of the Arab-Israeli
War of October 1973, we were developing, as a matter of urgency, a new and
comprehensive energy policy.

Our objective was, first, to reduce our hitherto growing dependence on
imported oil and, second, among home-produced sources of fuel and power,
to plan for the proper balance between coal, North Sea oil, natural gas and
nuclear power.

To this end we had already:
(a) Passed the Coal Industry Act, to provide massive funds for the industry's

modernisation and substantial extra money for miners' pensions and other
benefits; thus, for the first time in twenty years, providing the coal mining
industry and those who work in it with a secure future;

(b) Accelerated the exploitation of the vast proven oil reserves in the British
sector of the North Sea and set up the Scottish Petroleum Office under a
Scottish Minister to co-ordinate all on-shore developments;

(c) Initiated negotiations to purchase the entire natural gas output of the
Frigg field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea;

(d) Merged Britain's nuclear power station capacity into a single new
company, the National Nuclear Corporation, and agreed with the NNC and
the Central Electricity Generating Board to build a new generation of atomic
power stations.

In the light of the post-October 1973 energy crisis, and in particular the
rocketing price of imported oil, still further steps were needed. Accordingly,
we set up a Department of Energy under a Secretary of State, whose long
term goal is to achieve national self-sufficiency in energy.

The first oil from the British sector of the North Sea is due to be landed this
year and by 1980 the North Sea should be supplying the greater part of our
national needs. In full co-operation with private enterprise, we will press
ahead with the extraction and landing of North Sea oil, and prospecting for
Celtic Sea oil, as fast as is technically and humanly possible. Labour's
irrelevant and disastrous proposal to nationalise our offshore oil would
needlessly deprive Britain of an invaluable source of capital, skills and
experience, and would cause confusion and delay when the nation can least
afford it.

Britain has pioneered nuclear power technology. Already we generate a
higher proportion of our electricity in nuclear stations than any other
European country, and we shall shortly be announcing the details of our new
nuclear power station programme.

We are working out with the National Coal Board an expanded investment
programme for coal. We shall press ahead with the rapid development of the
newly discovered coalfield in Selby, Yorkshire - the largest and richest
unworked seam in Europe.

The new Department of Energy is urgently examining every possibility for
increasing our own national energy resources - including the use of methane
gas, solar power and tidal power. However successful we are in developing
the main sources of energy, the greater the range of available sources the less
vulnerable we shall be.

The new Department is also working out the details of a major energy
conservation programme, and will announce steps to ensure the maximum
efficiency in the use of expensive fuel. We will give a strong lead on
improving standards of building design so as to make the best use of fuel.

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

We will encourage higher insulation standards in homes, offices and
factories.

As a result of the measures already taken and those now proposed, we shall
be better placed in terms of energy supplies than most other nations.
However, while we should thus enjoy secure supplies of the fuels the nation
needs, we cannot escape from the higher cost of those fuels. The days of
cheap energy are gone for good.

Taken as a whole, our measures throughout the field of energy will set a
secure pattern for the future. But the nation's position must also be
safeguarded in the short term. We have already concluded an important
agreement with Iran to procure a substantial quantity of oil in exchange for
British exports.

We shall continue to work both within the framework of the European
Economic Community and in the wider context of consumer/producer
collaboration to ensure an adequate flow of oil from the major producing
countries, so long as our dependence on overseas sources of supply remains.

Industry, Agriculture, and The Regions

In present circumstances, energy policy must necessarily take pride of place
in the Government's programme to provide the essential long-term
framework for soundly based industrial and agricultural expansion.

But other aspects, to which we have rightly given priority in the past, will
not be forgotten or neglected.

During the past four years we have introduced a wide range of new measures
to bring new life to some of the older and decaying industrial regions of
Britain, both for the benefit of the people of those regions and of the
economic health of the nation as a whole.

Through the Industry Act, through free depreciation, and in other ways, we
have provided more effective financial incentives for industrial expansion in
these areas than they have ever previously enjoyed; and we have set up the
Industrial Development Executive to ensure that these incentives give the
greatest value for money.

We have greatly increased the programmes for improving housing and the
social services in these regions, and for clearing away the scars of
dereliction; and we have given them special priority in the provision of
industrial training. We have also greatly improved their transport links.

An important source of new help for the regions over the years ahead should
derive from our membership of the European Community. We attach
importance to a substantial fund devoted to Community Regional
Development, and a decision is to be taken early this year.

For the nation as a whole, we have introduced the Training Opportunities

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

Scheme, to meet the needs of an economy in which rapid technological
change and new patterns of demand shut down old jobs and open up new
ones. We have nearly trebled the numbers being trained and retrained under
Government auspices in Government Training Centres. Our Employment
and Training Act has provided industry with help in increasing its own
training, related to actual labour needs, through the newly established
Manpower Services Commission.

We shall continue to expand the Training Opportunities Scheme, and
continue to modernise the employment services.

We have announced new legislation to bring up to date the law dealing with
the health and safety of people at work.

We have announced a massive ten-year expansion and modernisation
programme for the steel industry.

After nearly four years of Conservative Government the British aircraft
industry has the biggest order book in this century. In technology, in research
and in production we have established skills and abilities which provide us
with immense opportunities within Europe and throughout the world to see
that this industry plays an important role in the future commercial success of
Britain.

We are the first Government to have given special attention to small firms,
appointing a Minister with special responsibility for them. We have
implemented the majority of the Bolton Report recommendations, especially
in the field of taxation. We do not believe that, in business, bigger is
necessarily better.

Agriculture

We reaffirm our traditional Conservative support for British agriculture,
which over the past four years, has enjoyed a marked resurgence of
confidence.

The past year has seen some sections of our agriculture doing well, while
others, such as the dairy industry, have been affected by the sharp rise in the
price of feedingstuffs. The particular problem of milk producers is being
dealt with in the Price Review to be announced very shortly.

The long-term prospects for the expansion of British agriculture have never
been better. Membership of the European Economic Community, for the
great majority of British farmers, is, and will continue to be, of enormous
benefit, ensuring an enlarged market for farm produce, increased returns to
efficient farmers and better protection from market fluctuations. Our current
balance of payments problems make a healthy home agriculture more
important than ever. Considerable opportunities for expansion exist, and our
policies will continue to recognise this.

Industrial Relations

But the Achilles heel of the British economy has long been, and continues to
be, industrial relations.

It is largely because of this that our economic progress since the war has

consistently lagged behind that of most other industrial nations - and will
continue to do so in the future, with grave consequences, unless a major

improvement in industrial relations can be secured.

It is in large part because of this that we find ourselves in the present crisis,
the gravest since the war.

By setting the pound free in the present unsettled situation, we have liberated
the economy and the nation from the restrictions of being pegged to an
unrealistic exchange rate. By drastically cutting taxation, we have liberated
the economy and the nation from the stultifying imposts of Socialism.

But we have not yet been able to liberate the economy and the nation from
the disruption, the inflation, and the inefficiency caused by bad industrial
relations.

The need for action on this front was recognised by our predecessors, who
first set up a Royal Commission to inquire into the subject and then prepared
a major Bill to reform trade union law - only to withdraw it in an abject and
humiliating surrender to trade union pressure. This disastrous incident has
played a large part in creating the present situation.

In accordance both with our pre-election pledges and with the clear will of
the majority of the British people, one of our first steps on taking office was
to act where Labour had capitulated.

The Industrial Relations Act represents the first thorough-going reform of
trade union law in modern times. Its purpose is to provide for an up-to-date
and realistic legal framework for industrial relations, to strengthen
responsible trade union leadership, to guarantee fundamental trade union
rights, to provide remedies hitherto unavailable for the peaceful solution of
disputes about negotiating rights, and to safeguard the individual from the
abuse of power, whether by management or unions. Although it is a matter
for national regret that its usefulness has been limited by the refusal, so far,
of most trade unions to co-operate in its working, it is nevertheless already
having some significant effects. More than 15,000 people have made use of
remedies it provides to protect individual rights and the National Industrial
Relations Court - although sup posed to be banned by the unions - has dealt
with almost 1,000 cases.

Other industrial countries have found that good industrial relations require a
proper framework of law and we are sure that Britain is no exception.

We shall therefore maintain the essential structure of the Industrial Relations
Act, but we shall amend it in the light of experience, and after consultation

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

with both sides of industry, in order

(a) to meet any valid criticisms;

(b) to make conciliation a pre-condition of court action; and

(c) to provide more effective control for the majority of union members by
ensuring that they have the opportunity to elect the governing bodies and
national leaders of their unions by a postal ballot.

We shall also seek to improve industrial relations by bringing in new
legislation, following discussions with both sides of industry, designed to
make large and medium-sized firms introduce a wider measure of employee-
participation. We have set up a steering group drawn from the Government,
the CBI and the TUC to study methods to improve job satisfaction.

Taxation

In our 1970 Election Manifesto we promised both to reduce and reform
taxation. Both these pledges have been carried out to the letter.

Whereas our predecessors, during their term of office, increased tax rates by
&pound;3,000 million a year, we have cut tax rates by an even greater
amount.

Food has been relieved of tax altogether. The biggest cuts in income tax
have been made by increases in the personal allowances, which give the
largest relief, proportionately, to the less well-off taxpayer. Many people
with small incomes have been relieved of income tax altogether. We have
also reduced the rate of tax on the first slice of income from savings, which
has helped those - usually elderly - living on small fixed incomes, who have
been particularly hard hit by rising prices.

In the field of tax reform, we have unified income tax and surtax in a single
graduated system of personal tax, in a form that can be simply under stood.
We have reformed company taxation, so as to end Labour's discrimination
against the ordinary shareholder. And we have replaced both Purchase Tax
and SET by a 10 per cent Value Added Tax - the lowest standard VAT rate in
Europe. No new tax is ever popular, and VAT is no exception. But it is fairer
and less onerous than the taxes it replaced.

Our record on tax reduction and tax reform speaks for itself. Obviously in
the present grave situation it would be irresponsible to make any
commitments about tax rates. But what we can promise is that the burden of
taxation on everyone in Britain will be far less than it would be under
Labour, which is committed to a hugely expensive programme of state take-
over, a massive expansion of public expenditure far beyond what the nation
can afford, and to a belief in high taxation as an end in itself.

We shall continue our programme of tax reform with the Tax Credit Scheme.

We will introduce legislation in the next Parliament in order to implement
the scheme as soon as the economic situation allows.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

The separation between the systems of taxation and social security has
proved, in recent years, an increasingly difficult obstacle to the creation of a
fair society. In particular, it has made it difficult to give sufficient help to
those who, while not in acute poverty, are nonetheless struggling and hard
pressed.

The Tax Credit Scheme will bring the two systems - of taxation and social
security - together in a single coherent scheme, which will greatly alleviate
this problem and bring immediate help to those now affected by it.

The introduction of the scheme will further simplify and modernise our tax
system, and bring substantial savings in the cost of administration. For social
security, it will represent the most important advance since the
implementation of the Beveridge Report more than a generation ago.

The first step would be to pay tax credits for children, including the first
child, for whom mothers at present receive no family allowance at all. These
child credits, which will be paid to the mother, will be worth more than the
existing income tax child allowances and family allowances which they will
replace. Mothers will get cash each week through the Post Office, in exactly
the same way as they cash the existing, but less valuable, family allowances.

When fully implemented the tax credit scheme:

¢ will provide a positive social benefit in cash to millions of hard-
pressed families with low incomes, especially where there are
children;

¢ will give credits as a right - automatically and without a means-test;

¢ will relieve hundreds of thousands of pensioners from the need to
claim supplementary benefit and give a significant increase in income
to another 3 or 4 million pensioners.

Helping the Pensioner

In the four years since we took office, we have:

(a)Increased pensions every year. Labour only increased pensions every
other year.

(b) Paid, in each of the last two years, a Christmas bonus as well. Labour
never did.

(c) Seen to it that, each year, the increase in the pension was greater than the
increase in the cost of living; so that each time there has been a real increase
in pensioners' living standards. During the last five years of Labour, the real
purchasing power of the pension actually fell.

(d) Paid a pension to those over-80s to whom Labour denied one altogether.

In addition, we have raised the amount that pensioners may earn without
having their pension reduced. We have improved the allowance which helps

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 14 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

many of those on supplementary pensions with the cost of heating their
homes.

We have lowered the age at which increases in public service and armed
forces pensions become payable, and we have further improved the position
of war pensioners and their widows. Public service pensions, armed forces
pensions and supplementary pensions are all now reviewed every single
year, together with the main national insurance benefits.

We have undertaken to give compensation to those public service pensioners
who have been adversely affected by the provisions of the statutory pay and
prices policy, and to allow similar steps to be taken by private occupational
schemes.

We are acutely conscious of the hardship suffered by many pensioners as a
result of inflation. That is why, for pensioners in particular, the most
important section of our programme for the next Parliament is our pledge to
hold the line against inflation.

Nevertheless, so far as the actual pension is concerned, we shall continue in
the next Parliament the progress we have made so far.

We shall continue to give the pensioner first priority in the entire field of
social service expenditure.

We have already moved from a two-yearly to an annual review of pensions
and all other benefits. We will now move to a six monthly up-rating of
pensions and other long-term benefits. We shall, of course, continue to
ensure that pensions are increased by at least as much as the cost of living.

We shall continue to relax the earnings rule during the next Parliament. Our
ultimate objective is to abolish it altogether.

What we shall not do is compete with the Labour Party in an auction of
promises which we do not believe can be kept. We are confident that a
dispassionate comparison of our record with that of our predecessors speaks
for itself.

Finally, in addition to doing our best to fulfil the community's responsibility
to those already retired or approaching retirement, we shall press ahead with
our new pensions scheme, which will, in the long term, completely
transform the financial prospects of those no longer at work. From next year,
every one in employment will be building up the right to a second pension,
related to their earnings, on top of the basic State pension. For most people
this will be provided through schemes run by the companies where they
work; but there will be a reserve State scheme for those who cannot
otherwise be properly covered.

The scheme for a second pension will include proper protection of pension
rights on change of job, better provision for widows, and some safeguard
against rising prices. It will ensure that, for future generations of the retired,
there will no longer be such a big drop in income which is so often the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 15 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

biggest single problem for those ceasing to work today.

This new scheme will greatly improve the pension prospects for women in
employment, for many of them will be able to earn a second pension for the
first time and many, too, will get a second widow's pension also for the first
time. Married women in employment will retain their right not to pay the
full contribution to the basic State scheme.

Meeting Special Need

A consistent feature of our social security policy since we first took office
has been the bringing of new help to particular groups in society, hitherto

insufficiently recognised by Governments, who have need of special help,
whether in cash or in care.

Thus we have:

(a) Introduced, for the first time, a range of additional 'invalidity' benefits for
wage-earners who cannot work because of long-term illness or incapacity;

(b) Introduced, for the first time, special tax-free attendance allowances for
seriously disabled people who need a great deal of care and attention;

(c) Introduced, for the first time, a Family Income Supplement for low wage
earning families with children;

(d) Introduced, for the first time, a widow's pension for women, without
young children, who were widowed between the ages of 40 and 50.

We are, however, conscious of how very much remains to be done in
meeting cases of special need, particularly so far as the disabled are
concerned. We shall be carrying out by this autumn our statutory duty to
report to Parliament on our proposals for improving the cash provision for
the disabled, including the possibility of a disablement income.

We recognise the serious problem of acute family deprivation which exists
in certain parts of the country - the inner city areas, some of our older
industrial areas and, indeed, some of the new housing estates where there
live families rehoused from the central parts of the cities. These areas often
contain many of the various forms of deprivation - bad housing, the most
out-dated school buildings, the oldest hospitals, lack of community facilities
and a bad environment generally - coupled with an inability to cope amongst
the families concerned, sometimes, but not always, caused by poverty.

We shall therefore start a new drive to bring more resources into these areas,
both to improve living conditions and the environment generally, and to
provide a wide range of advice and help to the families concerned. We will
concentrate this help on the worst areas; and give more opportunity for local
people to play a part in the affairs of their community.

In these and other deprived inner city areas we shall place special emphasis

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

on housing needs and the setting up of comprehensive advice centres, in
partnership with the significant contribution already being made by
independent voluntary agencies.

In London, these problems are becoming intensified by a shortage of men
and women to operate most public services and to teach in the schools. We
have therefore referred the whole question of the London Allowance payable
to teachers and other public servants to the Pay Board, and will act on the
Board's report as soon as we receive it.

We shall provide family planning within the National Health Service.

We shall continue to improve the services for the old, the disabled, the
mentally ill and the mentally handicapped at home, in the community and in
hospital. We shall publish a White Paper on services for the mentally ill. We
have increased greatly the numbers of home helps, district nurses and health
visitors. We shall improve the services for children and legislate on
adoption. We have set in hand help for the deaf and the arthritic and
rheumatic. We shall act as necessary on the Finer Report on one-parent
families when it is received.

We have much expanded the National Health Service. We have reformed its
administration to improve services to the patient. We shall implement the
principal recommendations of the Briggs Report on nursing, while
preserving the identity of the health visitor. We will take any steps
considered necessary to improve hospital complaint procedures in the light
of the D avies Report.

Our hospital, health centre and social service building programmes are all
much larger in real terms than those of our Labour predecessors. We plan to
supplement the District General Hospital network by a network of
community hospitals, basing them where practicable on some of the existing
smaller local hospitals. We aim to continue reducing the waiting time for
non-urgent surgery.

We reject Labour's proposal to abolish private practice and private provision
in association with the National Health Service. This is unacceptable in
principle and in practice would only reduce the skills available to patients as
a whole.

Throughout the entire field of meeting special need, we are particularly
conscious of the valuable work done by voluntary organisations, and we
shall continue to help them without compromising their independence. To
this end, we will review the legal framework within which charities operate.

HOUSING

The high level of interest rates in an inflationary world has inevitably put
difficulties in the way of the expansion of home ownership to which we
remain firmly committed. Nonetheless, since 1970, about a million families

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

have become home-owners for the first time, bringing the total to more than
half the families in Britain.

Over the first three full years since we took office, we have provided two
million new or improved homes. This is 500,000 more than Labour provided
in the previous three years, for which they were responsible.

The number of new home-owners would have been still larger had certain
Councils not opposed the sale of Council houses to those Council tenants
who were willing and able to buy them with the help offered by the
Government.

Subject to a right of appeal by the local authority to the Secretary of State on
clearly specified grounds, we shall ensure that, in future, established Council
tenants are able, as of right, to buy on reasonable terms the house or flat in
which they live.

We have made an agreement with the building societies which will ensure in
the long term greater stability in the flow of funds for house purchase, and
the building societies have agreed to introduce as soon as possible a scheme
to enable first-time purchasers to pay less in the early years of their
mortgage. We shall also seek other new ways to help young married couples
to become home-owners earlier, including new ways of channelling the
funds of leading financial institutions into the finance of house purchase.

We will provide new powers and more funds for the Housing Corporation
and the voluntary housing movement. This will provide dwellings for both
letting and co-ownership, and include new arrangements for people with
special housing problems.

We shall provide more houses for renting in areas of housing need.

We will ensure that both the local authorities and nationalised industries
release housing land for mixed schemes of public and private development.

We will continue with our slum clearance programme designed to clear the
slums by 1982.

We will continue our programme to improve older houses and will give extra
incentives for the selective improvement of areas of bad housing stress.
Legislation will be carried through to give greater emphasis to the housing
needs of inner urban areas.

We will strengthen action to cope with homelessness in areas of special need
by co-operation with the local authorities in the efficient use of existing
permanent and temporary accommodation and the provision of specially
designed hostels.

We intend to pay particular attention to the housing needs of the elderly and
the disabled who often need sheltered housing.

Our Housing Finance Act has, for the first time, brought fairness between

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 18 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

one tenant and another by concentrating help with the rent on those areas
and those families who most need it. Today, by law, and for the first time,
every family in a rented home - whether council or private, unfurnished or
furnished - can get such help if they need it.

This help has to be paid for. This has meant rent increases for the better off
tenants who had hitherto often been enjoying bigger subsidies than many
poorer families. But with nearly two million tenants already receiving rent
rebates or allowances, a large number of families are now paying less rent
than before the Act was passed.

At present, owner-occupiers with more rooms than they need are deterred
from letting, unfurnished, any part of their houses. We will consider whether
to remedy this by restoring to them the ability to regain possession. This
would help provide more accommodation for renting.

We will keep security of tenure for all those who already have it.

We have announced the severest financial penalties ever on property
profiteering, with special reference to empty office buildings.

Gains by individuals from the development value of property will now be
subject to income tax, up to the top rate of 75 per cent, in place of the former
flat rate of 30 per cent. As before, this will not apply to the principal home of
an owner-occupier. Development gains by companies will be taxed as
income at the full 40 per cent Corporation Tax rate, instead of 30 per cent.
For the first time unrealised gains from property will be taxed by treating the
first letting as a disposal for tax purposes.

We are also committed to taking new powers to deal with empty office
premises. These will enable the Minister to take possession of, and manage,
premises that have been unoccupied for more than two years. In addition,
local authorities will be empowered to levy rates on unoccupied buildings at
up to 100 per cent, and at a higher rate than this for certain empty
commercial premises.

We wholly reject Labour's policy of preventing any further extension of
freehold home-ownership by the nationalisation of every acre of land for
new building.

Improving the Environment

Right at the start of the last Parliament we set up, for the first time, a
Department of the Environment, which remains the only such ministry in the
world with so wide a range of powers and resources. As a result, we are now
acknowledged world leaders in environmental action in caring for towns,
cities, villages, rivers and the countryside.

Conservative policy is to protect our environment where it is good, and to
improve it where it is not good enough. We have already done much to
achieve this. The Green Belt has been greatly extended. More than 100 new

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 19 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

country parks have been opened since 1970. 'Operation Eyesore' has
improved the local environment in thousands of towns and villages. Millions
more trees have been planted. For every acre of derelict land cleared each
year under Labour, we have cleared over three. We have set up a Nature
Conservancy Council.

Clean air policy was at a standstill when Labour left office; we have more
than doubled the number of Smoke Control Orders, bringing clean air and
more sunlight to millions more people, especially in the North. Labour
neglected the rivers - we have been improving their condition at an average
rate of nearly three miles a week.

To reduce, still further, pollution of all kinds, we shall carry forward our
legislation to cut down noise and establish quiet zones in urban areas; to
accelerate the cleaning up of our rivers and estuaries; to curb fumes and
smoke from vehicles; and to deal more efficiently with waste, especially
toxic waste. We shall encourage the recycling of waste so as to conserve
scarce resources and reduce imports.

We shall further extend and protect the Green Belt.

We shall strengthen the legislation necessary to protect and extend
conservation areas, protect historic buildings and their gardens, control
demolition, and preserve more carefully trees and archeological sites.

To supplement conservation areas in the towns and cities, we shall empower
local authorities to designate environmental and amenity areas in all parts of
the country.

We shall continue our drive to bring derelict land back into beneficial use.
We shall further strengthen the Countryside Commission.

Transport

Continued growth of traffic has brought with it problems as well as
advantages; and has in particular made necessary an increasing reliance on
public transport. We have recently announced a massive five-year
programme for the railways to provide a modern network with a secure
future and the opportunity to regain freight traffic from the roads.

We shall modify the bus licensing system so as to give greater freedom for
new forms of local transport in country areas, while safeguarding existing
services.

We are already working to establish a system of lorry routes to keep heavy
vehicles out of towns and villages and away from narrow country lanes
where they have no business to he. With this as our priority, we shall
complete the major road network as soon as the economic situation allows.

We have given the new county authorities powers to enable them to fix their
own transport strategies and priorities.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 20 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

We will continue to take all possible steps to diminish noise and other
nuisances caused by new roads and the traffic which uses them.

Better Education

Conservatives have accorded high priority in the national budget to the
needs of education. Above all we are concerned to provide not merely more
education but better education. Better education is not only a matter of
resources. It is a matter of standards and of attitudes.

We have advanced in every sector of education but have attached special
importance to primary schools, believing that it is the early years that so
often determine a child's future progress. In the next Parliament we shall
continue to give priority to the early years of education.

We shall gradually extend free nursery schooling throughout the country so
that within ten years it should be available for all three- and four-year-old
children whose parents wish them to have it. We shall encourage pre-school
playgroups; their emphasis on involving the parent is particularly valuable.

Our second priority will continue to be special schools for the handicapped.
We have substantially increased the building programme for new schools.
Work will soon begin on the enquiry into special education which was
announced at the end of 1973.

In secondary education we shall continue to judge local education
authorities' proposals for changing the character of schools on their merits,
paying special regard to the wishes of parents and the retention of parental
choice. We believe it to be educationally unwise to impose a universal
system of comprehensive education on the entire country. Local education
authorities should allow genuine scope for parental choice, and we shall
continue to use our powers to give as much choice as possible.

We will defend the fundamental right of parents to spend their money on
their children's education should they wish to do so.

We shall continue to support the direct grant schools. They have helped to
provide increased opportunities for able children irrespective of their parents'
means.

We shall maintain the right of parents to choose denominational education
for their children if they so wish.

The expansion of further and higher education will be less rapid han planned
because of the reduced demand for places and the prevailing economic
circumstances, but numbers will continue to increase. The review of
students' grants is proceeding and we shall continue to improve the parental
income scale so that parents on a given income will pay less towards the
grant.

As soon as economic circumstances permit, we will improve the
opportunities for adult education in the light of the Russell Report.

We believe that the aims of the Youth Service should be more clearly
defined. We shall, therefore, be discussing its future development with the
local authorities and voluntary bodies who mostly provide this service, and
aim to ensure that decisions about the future of the Service take fully into
account the views of the young eople themselves. Given the right impetus,
the Youth Service can do a great deal to widen the scope for young people to
play a full and constructive part in local affairs and activities wherever they
live and work.

Because of our concern over reading standards in schools we have set up an
enquiry under Sir Alan Bullock to report on all aspects of the teaching of
English, including the written and spoken word. The conclusions are
expected later in the year.

A research study on mathematical standards is also in hand.

We share the public concern about indiscipline and truancy. Investigations
are being conducted into these problems, and we shall examine their findings
as a matter of urgency.

Higher standards of education can only be achieved through more and better
trained teachers. There are now some 60,000 more teachers in the schools
than there were three years ago; we are carrying out the objectives of the
James Report, which was itself set up as a result of a promise in our last
manifesto.

We wish to move the debate away from the kind of school which children
attend and concentrate on the kind of education they receive.

The Arts, Broadcasting and Recreation

We shall continue to give the fullest support and encouragement to the arts,
on which we are already spending &pound;50 million a year, more in fact
than any previous government. At a time when economic stringency is
necessarily limiting our material objectives it is more important than ever to
improve the quality of life.

The arts must be centred on the nation not on the capital. Generous grants
have gone to the regions in the past. Major arts centres will be established in
Cardiff and Edinburgh.

In accordance with the pledge in our 1970 election manifesto, we are
introducing a network of independent local radio stations, under the general
supervision of the Independent Broadcasting Authority, with local
newspaper participation.

Four of these stations are already in operation. We will bring forward
proposals for the allocation of a fourth TV channel when economic

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

circumstances permit.

We shall give further impetus to the Sports Council, whose powers and
funds we have already greatly expanded. Professional football clubs as well
as amateur sports organisations will be encouraged to join with local
authorities and voluntary bodies in the redevelopment of town centre
grounds for multi-purpose recreational needs.

Protectiing the Rights of the Individual

The rights of the individual citizen need to be protected both against the
power of the State and against other large and powerful bodies - whether
commercial undertakings, trade unions, or any other centre of power.

We have recognised this need in our measures so far, and will continue to do
so in the next Parliament.

We have acted decisively to protect the individual consumer. We have
passed the Fair Trading Act to increase the powers of the new Monopolies
and Mergers Commission and set up a Director-General of Fair Trading,
under the Act, to deal with unfair trading practices of all kinds. We have
legislated to impose stricter standards on insurance companies. We have, for
the first time, appointed a Cabinet Minister for Consumer Affairs, and have
introduced new legislation to prevent the consumer from having his legal
rights undermined by the small print of so-called 'guarantees'. We have also
legislated against the abuse known as pyramid selling. We have made it
easier for consumers to get cheap and speedy settlement of small claims in
the County Courts.

In the next Parliament, we shall continue to act in defence of the consumer
over a broad front. We will act to improve the effectiveness of the
nationalised industry consumer councils, to prevent confusion over
metrication by insisting on specific unit pricing of goods in the shops, and in
a wide range of other fields. In particular, we shall bring forward the
Consumer Credit Bill, which will require hire purchase agreements to show
the true rate of interest, prevent the unsolicited mailing of credit cards, and,
in general, comprehensively reform the law on consumer credit.

We shall carry through our proposals for new legislation to reform company
law by requiring of companies a much fuller disclosure of information to the
individual - whether shareholder, employee or a member of the general
public. By this measure, we will make British free enterprise the most open
in the world. We will have created a system of free enterprise more socially
responsible to the public, and with the power of the consumer greatly
enhanced.

We have appointed a Health Service Commissioner or 'ombudsman' to

investigate individual complaints about the National Health Service. We will
be introducing a similar system for complaints against local authorities.

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

Citizens' rights in Britain are far more extensive than most citizens'

awareness of those rights. This is particularly serious in the deprived central
areas of many of our large cities. In these and other 'stress' areas we shall set
up comprehensive advice centres, readily accessible to those who need help.

We have substantially improved the arrangements for consulting the public
in advance of major planning decisions, such as large redevelopment
schemes and the route to be followed by road schemes.

We have greatly extended the scope of compensation payable to those whose
property is adversely affected by developments such as road schemes. We
have provided for special extra compensation payments where a home-
owner or a tenant loses his home as a result of development.

We shall also reform the licensing laws in the light both of the Erroll Report
and of public reaction to it.

We have legislated to remove discrimination against women over a wide
range of the law.

We have introduced equal rights of guardianship for women.

We have taken special steps to ensure that movement towards equal pay for
women is not held back by the provisions of our counter-inflation policy.

We have improved the enforcement of maintenance payments to divorced or
deserted wives.

We will introduce major new legislation to end discrimination against
women at work, and to set up an Equal Opportunities Commission to
investigate other aspects of discrimination against women, and to
recommend further action.

We have taken steps to bring about more effective co-ordination of the work
of local authority social workers, doctors, teachers and all relevant
professional staff in detecting and preventing the ill-treatment of small
children. We will urgently study the report of the Committee of Enquiry into
the death of Maria Colwell, to see what further measures may be needed.

We shall strengthen existing safeguards in relation to the adoption of
children, following broadly the recommendations of the Houghton Report.

We shall introduce a reform of the abortion law, in the light of the forth
coming Lane Committee Report.

We will also, where necessary, act to ease restraints on publication under the
present laws of contempt of court and defamation where these restraints do
not infringe the rights of the individual. We will bring forward proposals to
preserve the privacy of the citizen against unauthorised or unjustifiable
intrusion, in the light of the Younger Report.

Other achievements and proposals concerned with the rights of the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 24 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

individual citizen appear elsewhere in this manifesto. Indeed the
preservation and enhancement of individual freedom within a framework of
responsibility is an underlying theme of all Conservative policy.

It is expressed in our determination to keep taxation as low as possible, so as
to give the individual wage-earner greater freedom to spend or save what he
earns as he thinks fit; in our Industrial Relations Act that gives new rights to
individual trade unionists; in our proposals for giving employees a right of
participation in the firms for which they work; in the importance we attach to
parental choice in education; and in a housing policy that emphasises the
freedom and independence that comes from home-ownership.

Local Government

We have carried through the most important reforms of local government
this century. We will continue those reforms by the appointment of local
ombudsmen.

We will review the electoral provisions for London boroughs in the context
of the arrangements for the rest of the country.

We favour a frank disclosure of local government finances to the people; for
example, the publication by each local authority of a Balance Sheet, a
Budget Statement, and annual spending programmes. Local government
services have continued to expand during our term of office, but we have
increased central Government's help to the ratepayers to meet the costs of
that expansion. We have substantially increased rate relief to the
householder. Three million rate- payers will benefit from the more generous
rate rebate scheme we have introduced.

We will, if necessary, change the law and practice relating to the conduct of
members and officers in local government wherever the possibility arises of
a conflict between their official positions and their private interests.

We will strengthen and improve the regional offices of Government. Local
authorities and the regional economic planning councils will be encouraged
to work more closely together so that the views and needs of the regions can
more effectively influence national decisions.

We are studying the Report of the Kilbrandon Commission.

We are publishing separate Manifestos for Scotland and Wales.

Law and Order

Protection of the law-abiding citizen is a prime duty of the State. We have
given higher priority to the support of law and order and the reduction of
crime than any Government for many years. The overall volume of crime in
the country has been dropping for the first time for nearly 20 years, and
although within this total, crimes of violence are still rising alarmingly there

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 25 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

are some encouraging signs even in this field - for example, the marked drop
in 1973 in the number of robberies and muggings.

We have increased and strengthened the police force. In real terms we are
spending today over 15 per cent more on the police than in 1970. For the
first time we have over 100,000 men and women in the Police Forces of
England and Wales and they are backed up by an extra 7,000 civilians.

We have reviewed the powers available to the Courts. We have increased the
maximum penalties for offences involving the use of firearms and for crimes
of vandalism. We have widened and strengthened the powers of the Courts
to order convicted criminals to compensate their victims. We have provided
new non-custodial forms of punishment whereby offenders can be required
to do useful work for the community.

We have substantially increased the size of the Probation Service and will
continue to do so.

In the next Parliament we shall continue to give the highest priority to
policies aimed at reducing crime and supporting freedom under the law. The
further strengthening of the police will be of particular importance.

We shall maintain the impetus of our measures of law reform. We shall
review the law against violent crime in the light of the Criminal Law
Revision Committee's forthcoming report on offences against the person. We
will further improve the legal aid and advisory services.

We will place the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, first introduced
by a Conservative Government, on a permanent statutory basis.

We shall provide for the introduction of an independent element in the
procedure for complaints against the police.

The growing display of indecent material in public places gives offence to
many people. Accordingly, we shall bring forward our Bill to prohibit this,
and to tighten up the law against sending through the post unsolicited matter
of an indecent nature.

We shall reform and liberalize the Official Secrets Acts, while retaining
those provisions essential for the protection of national security.

Having reviewed the law on picketing, we have come to the conclusion that
the present law as recently clarified by the Courts is adequate both to protect
the right of genuinely peaceful picketing and to penalise abuse. But we
believe that the lawful limits to peaceful picketing need to be more clearly
and widely known. We shall therefore publish a document setting out the
law on this subject in the belief that this will be an assistance both to the
observance and enforcement of the law.

We deplore the encouragement to politically-motivated law-breaking given
by the Labour Party's pledge to remove, retrospectively, the penalties
incurred by Clay Cross councillors for serious breaches of the Housing

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 26 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

Finance Act. A Conservative Government will continue to uphold the rule of
law.

As a people, we live in the freest democracy in the world, with a tradition of
individual liberty within the law and of peaceful change. If that tradition is
to be maintained, as we are determined that it shall be, it must not be abused.
In particular, we reaffirm our conviction that a criminal act does not cease to
be criminal by virtue of being committed ostensibly for political ends.

Immigration and Race Relations

By passing the 1971 Immigration Act, against the combined opposition of
the Labour and Liberal Parties, we have provided the country with the
necessary means for preventing any further large scale permanent
immigration and also with important new powers for preventing illegal
immigration. The Act became fully operative in January 1973 and its effects
in reinforcing all the other administrative action we have taken are already
becoming evident. Thus the number of new immigrants admitted in 1973
was the lowest since control was first introduced by the previous
Conservative Government more than a decade ago.

We intend that this decline shall continue. At the same time within this
declining figure we are honouring our obligations to the categories of people
in the Commonwealth for whom we have special responsibilities - namely
the close dependent relatives of immigrants settled here lawfully before the
new Act came into force and those people who, because of our imperial past,
possess citizen ship of this country and no other.

We have also set in hand a review of British nationality law, and dependent
on its outcome, new legislation to replace present British Nationality Acts
may be one of the measures required in the life of the next Parliament.

When we came to power in 1970, there were about 1.5 million coloured
people lawfully and permanently settled in this country. The great majority
are here to stay. Their children are being born and brought up here and
Britain is the only country they know as their own. The harmony of our
society in the future depends to an important extent on the white majority
and the coloured minority living and working together on equal terms and
with equal opportunities. We shall therefore pursue positive policies to
promote good race relations.

The first need for this purpose was to reassure everyone that new
immigration was being brought down to a small and inescapable minimum.
But beyond that we shall take further action to improve conditions in the
stress areas in the centres of many of our industrial towns and cities where
immigrant communities frequently concentrate and where the local
inhabitants have long had to endure poor housing and a deprived
environment.

Working for Peace in Northern Ireland

For the best part of five years now, our British soldiers have carried out their
duties superbly. Despite every kind of difficulty and provocation, they have
succeeded, with exemplary restraint, in restoring and maintaining a
substantial measure of law and order, in crushing the terrorist IRA
leadership in Northern Ireland, and in creating the conditions that have made
a political solution possible. No other army in the world could have achieved
what they have done: no praise is too high for them.

In March 1972 conditions in Northern Ireland had reached the point where
we were obliged temporarily to suspend the Province's Parliament and
institute a period of direct rule from Westminster, appointing a Secretary of
State for Northern Ireland. After almost two years of unceasing effort, the
extremists were isolated and a reconciliation was brought about between the
responsible political leaders of the Protestant and Catholic communities in
the Province.

This eventually resulted in a successful agreement at the tripartite meeting at
Sunningdale in December 1973.

In spite of the violence in Northern Ireland, industry there has shown a
remarkable resilience. In 1973 unemployment dropped substantially, the
number of industrial disputes was the lowest for a decade, and the rate of
growth of industrial production was the highest in the United Kingdom.
These achievements were made possible by a massive programme of
Government aid and by the united determination of workers and
management in the Province.

On January 1, 1974 the new Northern Ireland Executive took office. It is still
a tender plant. But the fact remains that those who used to be political
opponents are today working together on the new Executive in Northern Ire
land to bring a better life to their strife-torn Province.

This has been possible, above all, as a result of firm but fair Government
action which has succeeded, against all the odds, in mobilising the silent
majority of moderate opinion in Northern Ireland to assert itself against
extremists of all kinds.

In the next Parliament we shall continue, in the same spirit, to build on the
progress we have already achieved.

Britain, Europe and the World

The prime objective of our foreign policy is to preserve peace and maintain
the security and prosperity of the British nation. In order to achieve this we
need friends and allies. In the last 4 years, sometimes in very difficult
circumstances, Britain has made or consolidated friendships in the Far East,
China, the Indian Sub-Continent, Africa and the American Continent.
Progress has lately been made in re-establishing a proper relationship with
the Soviet Union.

A successful Commonwealth Conference has recently been held in Ottawa.

Above all, by successfully negotiating British membership of the European
Community, we achieved a major national objective which had eluded
successive British Governments of both Parties for more than a decade.

We have now been a member of the Community for a little over a year.
While it is therefore far too soon to attempt a complete assessment of the
implications for Britain of this historic step forward, it is already clear that
we are better able to secure our national interests both economic and
political within the Community than would have been possible had we
remained outside. Firms throughout the country have felt the benefit of
British membership for their export trade.

Every aspect of world affairs underlines the need for a Europe which is
united and can carry the maximum weight in the councils of the world. What
ever our internal differences, we must increasingly learn to speak strongly
with one voice which can be heard among the greatest powers, and which
can play its part in evolving mutually beneficial policies towards the rest of
the world, including the developing countries. This is what membership of
the Community is about. It means increasing economic strength for each
member and above all the certainty that there will be partnership instead of
rivalry and no more wars having their origin in Western Europe.

Meanwhile, by its very nature, the Community continues to develop and
evolve. In particular, just as Britain has to adapt to the Community, so the
Community has to adapt to Britain.

Since becoming a member, we have been a full and effective participant in
the making of Community decisions. We have made it clear that we are not
satisfied with every aspect of Community arrangements, and have sought -
and will continue to seek - changes where these are desirable.

A Conservative Government will urge on our Community partners the need
to extend the scope of Community action into industrial policy,
technological collaboration and social and environmental questions. This is
necessary if the full benefits of the larger market are to be reaped, and if we
are to realise the full potential of the Community as an instrument for
improving the life of the people.

We have already been instrumental in securing a decision in principle to set
up a European Regional Development Fund, a considerable proportion of
which will be devoted to helping the less prosperous regions of Britain. We
have been pressing hard within the Community for a sizeable fund, and a
decision is to be taken early this year.

The Community's Common Agricultural Policy provides British agriculture
with very real opportunities for expansion. But in a number of ways the
Common Agricultural Policy is now manifestly in need of reform; and we
shall continue to work so that the necessary changes can be made.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 29 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

The Conservative delegation to the European Assembly has already made a
telling impact. We shall continue to work for ways in which the
Community's institutions can be improved in order to make them more
responsive to public opinion and to reinforce democratic control.

Meanwhile, we will ensure that Parliament at Westminster can play a full
and effective part in the consideration of Community proposals in their
formative stage.

Renegotiation of the Community in the sense of reforming its practice and
redefining Britain's place in it, is a continuous process, which can only be
con ducted from within, and in which we are already playing a full part.
Renegotiation in the sense of British withdrawal, which is what a section of
the Labour Party seeks, would be a disaster for which future generations
would never forgive us.

Community membership has been of major importance for our foreign and
defence policy as a whole, providing us with a new dimension and a new
voice in world affairs. We reaffirm our full support for the Atlantic Alliance
within which we shall continue to seek still closer European co-operation in
defence and procurement.

The problems presented to Europe and all the developed and developing
countries by the increased price of oil need to be tackled both in Europe and
through wider international consultation. A new understanding must be
sought between consumers and producers in which plans for industrial
development and investment to mutual advantage would play an important
part.

We shall continue to play our full part in the United Nations. We shall
continue to maintain close relations with our fellow-members of the
Common wealth, based on a common heritage and mutual independence. We
shall seek to play our part in helping economic development in the poorer
parts of the world. It is essential for Britain as a trading nation that the
momentum of development in the Third World should not slacken.

We remain committed to try to reach a settlement in Rhodesia in accordance
with the five principles. We trust that, meanwhile, Europeans and Africans in
Rhodesia will make rapid progress towards agreement on constitutional
changes which would enable independence to be granted by the British
Parliament and sanctions to be lifted.

We shall seek to help the cause of peace in the Middle East. We reaffirm our
belief that the integrity of the State of Israel must be maintained, and at the
same time we will continue to give our support for withdrawal from
occupied territories, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the
United Nations.

We will continue to play a full part in the negotiations over Mutual and

Balanced Force Reductions and in the Conference on Security and Co-
operation in Europe where we will insist on some movement in the field of

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

an increased flow of information and ideas and people between East and
West. While progress towards détente must be our purpose we note with
concern the continuing expansion of all branches of the Soviet armed forces
- especially its rocket forces and its navies on the high seas. We therefore
need to maintain the NATO alliance and ensure that it is sufficiently strong
to deter any breach of the peace.

We shall maintain the effectiveness of the British nuclear deterrent.

We shall continue to ensure that the morale and effectiveness of our armed
forces are maintained at the highest possible level. This is vital if we are to
retain our security, which is essential to all our aspirations.

The Alternative - and The Choice

We have set out in this manifesto our proposals both for dealing with the
grave crisis now facing the nation and for building, once the crisis is
overcome, on the solid progress made before it broke.

We believe that these proposals - firm but fair, based on realism and
moderation - are what the British people desire and the situation demands.

They are also utterly different from those of the Labour Party.

The Labour Party today faces the nation committed to a left-wing
programme more dangerous and more extreme than ever before in its
history.

This commitment to extremism is no accident. In part, it has occurred as a
reaction against the manifest failure of its policies of gimmickry and so-
called pragmatism when it was last in office.

But, even more, it has occurred because the moderates within Labour's ranks
have lost control, and the real power in the Labour Party has been taken
over, for the first time ever, by its extreme Left wing. And this in turn has
been made possible by the dominance of a small group of power-hungry
trade union leaders, whose creature the Labour Party has now become.

The Labour Party today is committed to massive increases in taxation for all
- rich and poor alike - not simply as a means to an end, but as an end in

itself.

It is pledged to increase income tax, not just for the 'rich', but for millions of
ordinary wage and salary earners.

It has threatened to increase VAT on a wide range of household goods and
services, which would bring particular hardship to those less well off.

It has promised to levy heavier taxes on the self-employed.

Labour's policy for industry is one of massive nationalisation on an

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1974/Feb/february-1974-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 31 of 33

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

unprecedented scale.

In addition to taking over a number of named industries, Labour is pledged
to nationalise key firms in other industries and threatens to take over any
profitable firm throughout manufacturing industry.

In what would remain of private industry, it is explicitly committed to taking
power to issue arbitrary State 'directives' to any company and, if it sees fit, to
put in a Government ‘trustee’ to run the firm.

It has also talked glibly of nationalising banks, building societies and
insurance companies - which would mean taking over the savings of the
people.

Labour is committed to an irresponsible programme of public expenditure,
costing on its own admission some &pound;6,000 million a year, over and
above the huge cost of its nationalisation plans. This was far in excess of
what the national economy could afford even before the present crisis.

In education, it seeks doctrinaire uniformity throughout the State system,
and would abolish the independent schools. It is similarly committed to
abolishing freedom of choice in medical care.

It is committed to preventing any further extension of freehold home owner
ship, by taking over all the land on which future homes can be built.

It is also committed to indemnifying, at the taxpayers' and ratepayers’
expense, those law-breakers of whom it politically approves. Never before in
its history has the Labour Party shown such open contempt for the rule of
law.

The total effect of Labour's present policies would be to wreck the economy,
undermine the free society, and accelerate the present inflation beyond the
point of no return.

It has no effective policy whatever for dealing with the crucial problem of
wage inflation. It is committed to abandoning the legally-backed pay and
prices policy; but all it has to put in its place are the outdated and divisive
nostrums of class warfare.

It is not surprising that the moderates in Labour's ranks, who formerly held
the balance of power in their bitterly divided Party, opposed each and every
one of these extremist policies. But on each and every occasion, the
moderates were defeated by the now ascendant Left wing, and these policies
became firm official commitments.

However slick the public relations smokescreen, this is the reality of
declared Labour Party policy - and they mean what they said.

In short, the return of a Labour Government at the present time would be
nothing short of a major national disaster.

February 1974 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:39

The choice before the nation today, as never before, is a clear choice
between moderation and extremism.

We therefore appeal, at this critical time in our country's affairs, for the
support of the great moderate majority of the British people, men and
women of all Parties and no Party, who reject extremism in any shape or
form.

For extremism divides, while moderation unites; and it is only on the basis
of national unity that the present crisis can be overcome and a better Britain
built.

1970 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

A Better Tomorrow

Foreword

This Manifesto sets out the policies of the Conservative Party for a better
Britain. It provides a programme for a Parliament How fast we can go will
depend on how difficult a situation we find when we take office.

But good government is not lust a matter of the right policies. It also
depends on the way the government is run. This is something which I have
thought about deeply. Indeed, it has been one of my main interests since I
entered the House of Commons in 1950.

During the last six years we have suffered not only from bad policies, but
from a cheap and trivial style of government Decisions have been dictated
simply by the desire to catch tomorrow's headlines. The short-term gain has
counted for everything; the long-term objective has gone out of the window.
Every device has been used to gain immediate publicity, and government by
gimmick has become the order of the day. Decisions lightly entered into
have been as lightly abandoned.

It is not surprising that under this system several senior Labour Ministers
have at different times left the Government in disgust at the way it is run. It
is not surprising that when ever I have travelled abroad in recent years
friends of Britain have told me of their sadness at the way in which our
reputation has shrunk. It is not surprising that young people in this country
looking at politics for the first time should be suspicious and cynical.

I am determined therefore that a Conservative Government shall introduce a
new style of government: that we shall re-establish our sound and honest
British traditions in this field.

I want to see a fresh approach to the taking of decisions. The Government
should seek the best advice and listen carefully to it. It should not rush into
decisions, it should use up-to-date techniques for assessing the situation, it
should be deliberate and thorough. And in coming to its decisions it must
always recognise that its responsibility is to the people, and all the people, of
this country.

What is more, its decision should be aimed at the long term. The easy

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

answer and the quick trick may pay immediate dividends in terms of
publicity, but in the end it is the national interest which suffers. We have
seen that too often in the recent past.

Finally, once a decision is made, once a policy is established, the Prime
Minister and his colleagues should have the courage to stick to it Nothing
has done Britain more harm in the world than the endless backing and filling
which we have seen in recent years. Whether it be our defence
commitments, or our financial policies, or the reform of industrial relations,
the story has been the same. At the first sign of difficulty the Labour
Government has sounded the retreat, covering its withdrawal with a
smokescreen of unlikely excuses. But courage and intellectual honesty are
essential qualities in politics, and in the interest of our country it is high time
that we saw them again.

So it will not be enough for a Conservative Government to make a fresh start
with new policies. We must create a new way of running our national affairs.
This means sweeping away the trivialities and the gimmicks which now
dominate the political scene. It means dealing honestly and openly with the
House of Commons, with the press and with the public.

The decisions which a Government has to take affect the livelihood and
perhaps the lives of millions of our fellow citizens. No-one has any business
to take part in public life unless he is prepared to take such decisions with
the seriousness which they deserve.

This is my strongest personal conviction, and I shall not be content until it is
the guiding principle of the government of this country.

Edward Heath

A Better Tomorrow

This election is about Britain's tomorrow. The choice of a Government for
the next five years will go far to determine the future of our country right
through the seventies and beyond.

The Failures of Today

The nation now knows what five years of Labour rule can mean. Hundreds
of thousands of extra families suffering the hardship and insecurity of
unemployment. Increasing problems of poverty and homelessness.
Pensioners helpless as they watch the extra shillings eaten up by the fastest
price rise for twenty years. Housewives struggling to make ends meet.
£3,000 million a year of extra taxation equivalent to £3.10. 0d a week for
every family. A devalued £. A new load of foreign debt, some of it stretching
ahead into the twenty-first century.

Britain has paid many times over in lost opportunity for the benefit of any
improvement on our overseas trade account. The nation has lost £12,000

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

million in potential wealth as the result of Labour's failure to maintain
expansion. That's about £750 for every family in the country.

Our economy has expanded more slowly than that of any other comparable
country in the world. Almost everywhere in Western Europe and North
America the standard of living grows faster than in Britain. International
experts are predicting that if these trends are allowed to continue Britain will
soon be the poorest major country in the West.

As a nation, we have been starved of achievement. We have become
conditioned to failure.

To pay our way, normal in Conservative years, now seems like a miracle.
High unemployment is no longer the exception but the rule. We have
become resigned to the value of the £ in our pockets or purses falling by at
least a shilling a year. For a year to pass without a crisis has become cause
for congratulation.

Yet before these locust years of Labour, we had the Conservative years of
rising prosperity. Years when Britain's industry expanded faster. When the
standard of living grew three times as fast. When prices rose more slowly.
When unemployment was low. When tax rates were cut time after time.
When pensions rose twice as fast as prices. When the social services at home
advanced more rapidly, and Britain played a proper part in helping poorer
countries overseas.

Conservatives are proud of yesterday's achievements. Angered by today's
failures. Determined that tomorrow shall be better again.

We remember 1966, when the strengthening balance of payments which was
Labour's true inheritance was smothered by the disastrous irresponsibility of
a Party whose one concern was electoral success. Before the election,
surplus and smiles. Afterwards, savage tax increases, the wage freeze, and a
headlong plunge into deficit, devaluation and debt. It need not and must not
be allowed to happen again.

Labour Has Nothing to Offer

Labour's policies for the future are their policies of the past. Nothing to curb
the rise in prices. Nothing to cut the human waste of unemployment.
Nothing to see that extra social help goes where the need is greatest.

More taxes. More blanket subsidies. More state ownership. More civil
servants. More government interference.

No new encouragement to earn and save. No new incentive to invest and
expand. No new policy to bring about better relations in industry. No new

deal for our farmers.

Just the mixture as before.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 26

They have little to boast of in their record. Even less to put forward for the
future. So they talk, instead, of their ideals.

But lust what are those ideals?

What ideal is it that leads a government to policies that double the rate of
unemployment?

What ideal is it that makes it impossible for so many young couples to afford
a home of their own, sets out to prevent people buying the council house
they live in, and brings about the biggest drop in house-building in a quarter
of a century?

What ideal is it that makes the poor get poorer, and three times votes down
pensions for the over-eighties?

What ideal is it that breaks our country's word abroad, weakens our
defences, leaves our friends in the lurch, and cuts down our overseas aid?

What ideal is it that has to be propped up by rigging electoral boundaries?
What ideal is it that leaves a litter of broken promises wherever it goes?

Labour must answer for itself. But whatever its ideals may be, they have
nothing in common with the values which Conservatives proclaim.

The Conservative Way

We want to build a better Britain. A Britain we can all be proud of. A Britain
in which future generations will be happy to live. A. Britain which other
nations will admire.

We want a country which makes the fullest use of all its human and material
resources to build a new prosperity. A country which uses that prosperity
wisely and well, helping the elderly and those in need, providing new
educational opportunity for our children, investing for the future as well as
giving us a fuller life today. A country confident in itself, playing a full part
in the world's affairs, accepting and meeting its responsibilities to others.

We want a society in which material advance goes hand in hand with the
deeper values which go to make up the quality of life. A society which cares
for its cities, towns and villages, its rivers, its coast, its countryside.

We want people to achieve the security and independence of personal
ownership greater freedom of opportunity, greater freedom of choice, greater
freedom from government regulation and interference. A responsible
democracy based on honest government and respect for the law.

Despite all the failures and frustrations of recent years, Britain is still the

best country in the world in which to live. But at best we have been marking
time, at worst slipping back. It could and should be so much better.

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

In this Manifesto we present our policies to end the retreat and begin instead
a new advance.

Our policies are not, like Labour's, a collection of short lived devices. They
make up a strategy for the next five years - a programme for a Parliament.

Nor are they a set of promises made only to be broken. The last
Conservative Government kept all its promises. So will the next.

We start with the economy because this remains the key. The true problem in
social policy is not that we spend too much but that with Labour stagnation
we can afford too little.

Britain now faces the worst inflation for twenty years. This is mainly the
result of tax increases and devaluation. In implementing all our policies, the
need to curb inflation will come first. For only then can our broader strategy
succeed.

Our theme is to replace Labour's restrictions with Conservative incentive.
We utterly reject the philosophy of compulsory wage control. We want
instead to get production up and encourage everyone to give of their best.

e We want an economy based on more jobs, higher wages that are well-
earned, and lower costs.

e We will reduce and reform taxation, giving first priority to reducing
income tax so that people will keep a fairer reward for their work.

e We will create the basis for these reductions by giving new incentive
to saving and by cutting out unnecessary state spending.

e We will strengthen responsible trade unions and good management by
establishing fair, up-to-date rules for industrial relations.

e We will greatly increase opportunities for men and women to train for
new and better jobs.

e We will stop further nationalisation, and create a climate for free
enterprise to expand.

e We will introduce effective regional development policies to bring
prosperity to every part of our country.

e We will give agriculture a real opportunity to increase production.

These are policies to enable people and government to work together to
create new national wealth. Only on the secure basis of this foundation can
we help everyone to build a better tomorrow for themselves and their
families.

Our education policy will give greater priority to the primary schools, where
an inadequate start can so easily destroy the chance that every child must
have to develop its talents to the full.

We will reverse the decline in building, make home ownership easier again,
and concentrate Government subsidies where they are most needed.

We will give priority to those most in need - the over-80s without pensions,
the elderly, the disabled, the chronic sick, the children in families below the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

poverty line.

Our policies will reduce the causes of racial tension, and we will ensure that
there will be no further large scale permanent immigration.

We will protect Britain's interests overseas, and play our part in promoting
peace and progress in the world.

These policies will strengthen Britain so that we can negotiate with the
European Community confident in the knowledge that we can stand on our
own if the price is too high.

A New Opportunity

The aim of these policies is to create the new opportunity for a better
tomorrow.

¢ A better tomorrow with living standards rising again at a reasonable
rate so that every family can enjoy a fuller life.

¢ A better tomorrow for all: for the families that are homeless today, for
the unemployed; for the children still in poverty, and for the old and
the lonely.

¢ A better tomorrow with greater freedom: freedom to earn and to save,
freedom from government interference, freedom of choice, freedom
from fear of crime and violence.

e A better tomorrow in a better Britain: with the beauty of our
countryside preserved and improved, with our towns and cities made
more pleasant to live in. A better tomorrow with a deeper appreciation
of the quality and goodness of life.

Our nation has so much to be proud of and so much to offer. All we need

now is a new opportunity that will allow the people of Britain to create for
themselves a better tomorrow.

Our Programme

These are our plans for making tomorrow better than today.
Lower Taxes
We will reduce taxation. We will simplify the tax system.

We will concentrate on making progressive and substantial reductions in
income tax and surtax.

These reductions will be possible because we will cut Out unnecessary
Government spending and because we will encourage savings. And as our

national income rises we will get a larger revenue with lower tax rates.

We will abolish the Selective Employment Tax, as part of a wider reform of

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

indirect taxation possibly involving the replacement of purchase tax by a
value-added tax.

The value-added tax, already widely adopted in Western Europe and
Scandinavia, is in effect a general sales tax, operated in a way which allows
for desirable exemptions - for example, exports. It could help to make our
system of taxes on spending more broadly based, less discriminatory, and
fairer in its impact on different types of industry and service.

It would not apply to food, except for those few items already subject to
purchase tax. It would not apply to normal farming activities, nor to very
small businesses; and special arrangements would be made for housing. No
Opposition could commit itself finally in advance of an election to a major
new tax of this kind which would need detailed consultation with the civil
service.

Labour's betterment levy has increased bureaucracy and put up the price of
land and houses. We will do away with it and collect any tax due on a sale of
land through the capital gains tax, with exemption for owner-occupiers.

We will end the tax nonsense which makes some married couples pay more
tax on their joint earnings than they would if they were not married. We will
repeal the Labour changes which have imposed new penalties on children's
income and disallowed the interest on many loans as a deduction from
income for tax purposes.

We will encourage the flow of private funds to charities including voluntary
social service, sport and the arts.

Labour has put tax rates up by over £3,000 million. We are determined to
reverse this process. High taxation discourages effort and saving, deadens
the spirit of enterprise and causes many of our best brains to leave the
country.

In the thirteen years of Conservative prosperity we cut tax rates by £2,000
million - as well as doubling expenditure on the social services. We have
done it before: we can do it again.

More Savings

When savings go up, taxes can come down. If savings had increased as fast
during the last six years under Labour as they did in the previous six years
with the Conservatives, taxation could now be £2,000 million lower - the
equivalent of the whole of the selective employment tax and more than two
shillings off income tax.

We will encourage all forms of saving, and saving at every level of earnings.
Every family should be able to accumulate savings to give security and

independence, to provide for their old age and their children's future.

Our tax policies will stimulate savings. We will introduce a more

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

imaginative contractual savings scheme designed particularly to attract new
savings. Our plans for more home ownership and an extension of private and
occupational pension schemes must mean higher personal savings. We have
already done much and will do more to develop a ‘property-owning
democracy': now we must also progress towards the capital-owning
democracy of the future, for individuals and families who save and
accumulate wealth serve the nation as truly as they serve themselves.

Controlling Government Spending

Under Labour, there has been too much government interference in the day-
to-day workings of industry and local government. There has been too much
government: there will be less.

We will reduce the number of Ministers. We will reduce the number of civil
servants: under Labour their numbers have grown by over 60,000. The Land
Commission will be abolished. The functions and responsibilities of all
departments and government agencies will be systematically rationalised.
There will be cost-reduction plans for every single Ministry in Whitehall,
and the widespread application throughout government of the most modern
management, budgeting and cost-effectiveness techniques. Some present
government activities could be better organised using competent managers
recruited from industry and commerce. Plans to achieve this new style of
government are well advanced. It will be more efficient and less costly.

Detailed policies set out in this document will also lead to reductions in the
weight of government spending.

Steadier Prices

The cost of living has rocketed during the last six years. Prices are now
rising more than twice as fast as they did during the Conservative years. And
prices have been zooming upwards at the very same time as the Government
have been taking an ever-increasing slice of people's earnings in taxation.
Soaring prices and increasing taxes are an evil and disastrous combination.

Inflation is not only damaging to the economy; it is a major cause of social
injustice, always hitting hardest at the weakest and poorest members of the
community.

The main causes of rising prices are Labour's damaging policies of high
taxation and devaluation. Labour's compulsory wage control was a failure
and we will not repeat it.

The Labour Government's own figures show that, last year, taxation and
price increases more than cancelled any increase in incomes. So wages
started chasing prices up in a desperate and understandable attempt to
improve living standards.

Other countries achieve a low-cost high-wage economy. So can we. Our
policies of strengthening competition will help to keep down prices in the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

shops. Our policies for cutting taxes, for better industrial relations, for
greater retraining, for improved efficiency in Government and industry - all
these will help to stimulate output. This faster growth will mean that we can
combine higher wages with steadier prices to bring a real increase in living
standards.

Under the last Conservative Government, wages rose twice as fast as prices,
living standards rose three times as fast as they have under Labour, and
Britain achieved one of the best records in Europe for steady prices.

The Labour Government's policies have unleashed forces which no
Government could hope to reverse overnight. The first essential is for the
new Government to give a new lead. We will subject all proposed price rises
in the public sector to the most searching scrutiny. If they are not justified,
they will not be allowed. In implementing our policies, we will give
overriding priority to bringing the present inflation under control.

Fair Deal at Work

There were more strikes in 1969 than ever before in our history. Already in
the first three months of 1970 there were 1,134 strikes compared with 718 in
the same period last year, when the Labour Government said the position
was so serious that legislation was essential in the national interest. This
rapid and serious deterioration directly stems from Labour's failure to carry
through its own policy for the reform of industrial relations.

We will introduce a comprehensive Industrial Relations Bill in the first
Session of the new Parliament. It will provide a proper framework of law
within which improved relation ships between management, men and unions
can develop. We welcome the TUC's willingness to take action through its
own machinery against those who disrupt industrial peace by
unconstitutional or unofficial action. Yet it is no substitute for the new set of
fair and reasonable rules we will introduce.

We aim to strengthen the unions and their official leadership by providing
some deter rent against irresponsible action by unofficial minorities. We seek
to create conditions in which strikes become the means of last resort, not of
first resort, as they now so often are.

Our new Act will establish clear rights and obligations for unions and
employers. It will lay down what is lawful and what isn't lawful in the
conduct of industrial disputes. It will also introduce new safeguards for the
individual - the right of appeal against unjust dismissal by an employer or
unjust action by a union.

The framework of law we will establish will provide for agreements to be
binding on both unions and employers. A new Registrar of Trades Unions
and Employers' Associations will ensure that their rules are fair, just,
democratic, and not in conflict with the public interest. In the case of a
dispute which would seriously endanger the national interest, our Act will
provide for the holding of a secret ballot and for a 'cooling-off period' of not

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40
less than sixty days.

Associated with our new Act will be a Code of Practice laying down
guidelines for good collective agreements and standards for good
management and trade union practices in the individual company.

Training for Better Jobs

We want to help people seeking new and better jobs. This involves provision
for redundancy, opportunities for retraining, the maintenance of living
standards during retraining, and assistance - particularly with housing - for
those who have to move. Existing arrangements are inadequate: they will be
improved. We will stimulate a massive retraining programme for men and
women in industry. We will closely examine the work of the Industrial
Training Boards and the operation of the levy/grant system, so as to root out
unnecessary bureaucracy and ensure the full support of industry and the
closest co-operation with further and higher education.

We will also encourage wider and better provision for management training.
Modern industry imposes new and heavy burdens on all levels of
management. Good management is essential not only for efficiency and the
proper use of capital resources, but also for the creation of good industrial
relations.

Industrial Progress

Competitive free enterprise ensures choice for the consumer. Profitable free
enterprise provides the resources for both capital investment and higher
wages. We will pursue a vigorous competition policy. We will check any
abuse of dominant market power or monopoly, strengthening and reforming
the machinery which exists.

We reject the detailed intervention of Socialism which usurps the functions
of management and seeks to dictate prices and earnings in industry. We
much prefer a system of general pressures, creating an economic climate
which favours, and rewards, enterprise and efficiency. Our aim is to identify
and remove obstacles that prevent effective competition and restrict
initiative.

We will sharpen the disclosure requirements in the accounts of public
companies subject to an exemption procedure and reduce them for most
private companies, and will institute an inquiry into other aspects of
company law. As prosperity increases we will progressively reduce
restrictions on overseas investment.

Small businesses have had a raw deal from Labour. They have had to suffer
higher and more complicated taxes, and waste more time filling up forms.
Our policies for reducing taxation and reducing government interference in
industry will reduce the heavy burdens on the small firm. We will decide the
best method of providing advice and encouragement for small businesses in

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

the light of the Bolton Report.

We are totally opposed to further nationalisation of British industry. We will
repeal the so-called Industrial Expansion Act which gives the Government
power to use taxpayers money to buy its way into private industry. Specific
projects approved by Parliament will continue to be given Government
support. We will drastically modify the Industrial Reorganisation
Corporation Act.

The quality and cost of transport services affect the fares and prices
everyone pays. We will continue an expanding road programme, improving
in particular roads in Scotland, Wales, the South West, and the development
areas. 85 per cent of the freight throughout the country is carried by road.
Cheap and efficient service must be combined with high standards of public
safety. We will repeal the Labour Government's law which would prevent
lorries driving more than 100 miles without a specially obtained licence.

We will progressively reduce the involvement of the State in the nationalised
industries, for example in the steel industry, so as to improve their
competitiveness. An increasing use of private capital will help to reduce the
burden on the taxpayer, get better investment decisions, and ensure more
effective use of total resources.

The railways have a vital part to play in the modernisation of the transport
system. They need to provide new passenger facilities, interchanges with the
car and bus, and freight depots outside the urban areas. Shipping lines,
hotels, parking facilities, catering services, vacant land, can all be developed
more effectively in partnership with private enterprise. This will give better
service to the public.

We will prevent the waste of £76 million on the nationalisation of the ports.
We will end the uncertainty hanging over both large and small ports by
giving them the freedom to build, in competition with each other but co-
ordinated through a strong central authority.

The bureaucratic burden imposed upon industry by government departments,
agencies and boards has steadily increased in recent years. We will see that it
is reduced.

We will encourage investment through tax allowances or reductions rather
than by means of grant - with differential arrangements in favour of the
development areas. And the more flexible system of grants under the Local
Employment Acts will be retained as an important part of our regional
policy. These changes will be subject to transitional arrangements and will
not in any way be retrospective. Special assistance for particular industries
like shipping will be continued.

Prosperity For All Areas

We regard an effective regional development policy as a vital element in our
economic and social strategy; economically, because both prosperous and

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

less prosperous areas are affected by the present regional imbalance and
waste of resources it involves; socially, because we are not prepared to
tolerate the human waste and suffering that accompany persistent
unemployment, dereliction and decline.

We will stimulate long-term growth by increasing the basic economic
attraction of the areas concerned. This is a markedly different approach from
that followed by Labour, who have five separate and often unco-ordinated
government departments spending very large sums of money with little
regard to the practical effect. Despite the Government's lavish spending of
the taxpayer's money during the last six years, in Scotland, Wales, and most
regions of England there are hundreds of thousands fewer jobs. Since 1966,
the country has experienced the longest period of high unemployment since
the 1930s.

We will link expenditure more closely to the creation of new jobs, especially
in industries with growth potential, and to improvements in the economic
facilities of the development areas. We will maintain regional assistance to
each development area. We will initiate a thorough-going study of
development area policy as was recommended by the Hunt Committee. We
will phase out the Regional Employment Premium, taking proper account of
existing obligations and commitments. We will maintain financial incentives
for investment in the development areas, making greater use of the powers
given by the Local Employments Acts, and these powers will also be used
where appropriate in the intermediate areas. We will give fairer treatment to
the service industries and to commerce. We will give special attention to the
needs of the development areas in our plans for a massive increase in
retraining facilities.

Some resources could with advantage be switched from the present general
subsidies towards the better training schemes and the infra-structure needed
to make both development and intermediate areas more attractive to live in -
and to invest in. More skilled workers, good housing, better schools, and
first-class communications provide a surer long-term answer to the problems
of regional development than indiscriminate financial hand-outs.

We will continue to provide financial assistance to the Northern Ireland
Government so that all parts of Northern Ireland may enjoy the full benefits
of United Kingdom prosperity.

Food and Farming

Farmers are frustrated and disgruntled. Labour has failed to allow British
agriculture to expand and prosper. We will provide new opportunities for the
farming community to increase production, improve their incomes, and
make a further massive contribution through import-saving to the balance of
payments.

We will retain the Annual Price Review system, the production grant system,
and the marketing boards, but will introduce levies on imports in order to

enable us to eliminate the need for deficiency payments in their present

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

form. These levies, variable at very short notice, will deal effectively and
immediately with dumping from overseas and will thus do away with the old
cumbersome and slow procedures. The changeover will be spread over at
least three years. The present support system will be maintained in full
throughout this transitional period, although its cost will decline. Thereafter
it will continue in the form of a 'fall-back' guarantee. Before the new system
is introduced, there will be full discussions with our international suppliers
and with the farmers' unions.

This fundamental change will provide much-needed scope for agricultural
expansion. The resultant small increase in food prices will amount to just
over a penny in the £ per year on the cost of living for three years - a small
increase in comparison with the five shillings in the £ rise of the last six
years. The Exchequer will benefit by some £250 million, which can be used
for tax reductions and for selective improvements in social security
payments.

We will free from rates all buildings which a farmer uses for producing food
from his land.

We will continue to encourage the development of British horticulture
through the Horticultural Improvement Scheme. We will also maintain, and
where appropriate expand, statutory provision through the Central Council
for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation, to encourage better and
more uniform marketing of horticultural produce.

A thriving and expanding forestry industry can reduce dependence upon
costly imported timber and can, particularly in Scotland, make good use of
difficult land and provide a comparatively high level of employment.

We will promote the prosperity of the fishing industry, and will ensure that
the home fishing industry is enabled to compete effectively in British
markets without unfair competition from dumped imports.

Homes for All

New drive and impetus is urgently needed to reverse the biggest decline in
the housing programme for a quarter of a century. Labour has failed to
honour its pledge to build 500,000 houses a year by 1970. It is scandalous
that this year, as last year, fewer houses will be completed than in 1964 when
Labour took over. And far fewer are under construction. One million people
to whom Labour promised a new home by 1970 are still waiting.

Our vigorous new housing drive for the 1970s will have three main
objectives:

e To house the homeless, to concentrate on slum clearance and to
provide better housing for those many families living without modern
amenities.

¢ To bring about a great increase in home ownership so that the majority
of our nation fulfil their wish to live in a home of their own.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

¢ To see that the tenant, whether of a private property or of a council
house, receives a fair deal.

Under the present subsidy system, too little help goes to the homeless and
the badly housed; too little help also goes to provide housing for the elderly
and the disabled. We will re-negotiate the housing subsidy system so that the
full weight of Government assistance goes behind tackling the worst areas of
our housing problems.

The problem of the homeless is concealed by unrealistic official statistics.
We will lay down a more sensible definition, and then make sure that
families without a home or living in intolerable conditions receive priority.

We seek a big increase in the programme of modernisation of our older
houses, in co-operation with movements such as Shelter.

We will, in consultation with the voluntary housing movement, give a new
momentum to housing associations, co-ownership and cost-rent groups. This
movement, if encouraged and assisted in its organisation and financing, can
do much to cope with and to care for the problems of the elderly and the
homeless.

Too often those confronted with housing problems have nowhere to turn for
advice. Housing advisory centres will be set up in co-operation with
voluntary housing organisations and the local authorities. People will then
have an easy means of discovering how they can apply for a council house
or an improvement grant, how they can obtain a mortgage, how the ‘fair rent!
system works, or where to contact a housing association or a cost-rent
society.

The number of new houses built for owner-occupation has declined month
by month. The increase in the cost of new houses and the highest mortgage
interest rates in our history have prevented thousands of young people from
becoming owners of their own homes. Labour promised cheaper houses and
lower mortgage interest rates. But today the mortgage repayments on the
average-priced new house are £3 per week more than when Labour came to
power.

Our policies to abolish the Selective Employment Tax and to abolish the
Land Commission, and to get more land released for building, will help to
keep down house prices.

We will make both the 100 per cent mortgage scheme and the mortgage
option scheme more flexible.

The improvements we will make to the Save As You Earn scheme will
encourage a larger flow of funds into building societies.

We will encourage local authorities to sell council houses to those of their
tenants who wish to buy them. Thus many council house tenants of today
will become the owners of their own homes tomorrow. As a result, more
money will be immediately available for the local authorities to provide

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

housing for the aged, for the disabled, and for those on the housing lists.

Our policies for encouraging home ownership will also mean that more
council house tenants can move into homes of their own, thus releasing their
council houses for those in need.

The present system of government council house subsidies is wasteful and
inefficient; all too often those receiving subsidies are better off than those
who pay for them through rates and taxes. We will change the system so that
subsidies are used for adequate rent rebates for those tenants who cannot
afford to pay fair rents, and also for slum clearance and other essential
programmes.

We will maintain the security of tenure provisions of the 1965 Housing Act,
and the fair rent system. We will continue the process - started under
Labour's Housing Act of 1969 - of their gradual extension to the remaining
controlled tenancies.

We will review and improve the machinery of compensation to see that it is
fair and just to those whose property is compulsorily purchased or adversely
affected or blighted by road and redevelopment schemes.

Social Service Advance

The fundamental problem of all Britain's social services - education, health,
provision for the old and those in need - is the shortage of resources.

Of course money isn't everything. Much will always depend on the devoted
work and care of teachers, doctors, nurses, welfare workers of all kinds, both
professional and voluntary. But too often today their most dedicated efforts
are frustrated and undermined by inadequate facilities and never-ending
worry about finance.

With Labour's economic stagnation it is little wonder that in many cases
these problems are getting steadily worse. The slow-down in economic
growth which Labour Government has brought has already cost our country
some £12,000 million in lost production. Even one-tenth of the revenue lost
by the Government as a result of this stagnation would have paid for 100
hospitals and 1,000 schools.

In our last five years of Government, spending on the social services
increased at a much faster rate in real terms than in the five years of Labour
Government. Taking account of rising prices, Selective Employment Tax,
the family allowance clawback, and the increased cost of unemployment
benefit, our spending increased 36 per cent compared with only 25 per cent
under Labour.

Our aim is to develop and improve Britain's social services to the full: here
too, tomorrow must be better than today.

Immediately we can help by establishing more sensible priorities. But the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 15 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

only true solution is to increase what we can afford. The theme and purpose
of our policies for the economy is to enable government and people to work
together to create new national wealth. Only then will there be a firm
foundation for new social advance.

Better Education

In education above all the problem of resources is crucial. The number of
children in the schools is rising. More and more are qualifying to go on to
colleges, polytechnics and universities. That they should be able to develop
their abilities to the full is not only right in itself but a vital national
investment in the future.

Within the education budget itself, we shall shift the emphasis in favour of
primary schools - the foundation on which all later education and training is
built.

We also recognise the need for expansion of nursery education. This is
especially important in areas of social handicap, such as the poorer parts of
our large cities, where it is so vital to give children a better start.

In secondary education, a number of different patterns have developed over
the years, including many types of comprehensive school. We will maintain
the existing rights of local education authorities to decide what is best for
their area.

They will take into account the general acceptance that in most cases the age
of eleven is too early to make final decisions which might affect a child's
whole future. Many of the most imaginative new schemes abolishing the
eleven-plus have been introduced by Conservative councils.

Local councils must ensure that the education they provide is the best for the
children, taking into account the suitability of the buildings, the supply of
staff, the travelling distances involved, the advice of teachers, and the wishes
of parents and local electors. And they must be certain that they provide
properly for the late developer. And they will naturally be slow to make
irrevocable changes to any good school unless they are sure that the
alternative is better.

We believe that the proper role of the central government is to satisfy itself
that every local education authority provides education which will enable a
child's talents and abilities to be developed to the full, at whatever age these
may appear. All children must have the opportunity of getting to 'O' level
and beyond if they are capable of doing so.

We therefore believe that Labour's attempt to insist on compulsory
reorganisation on rigid lines is contrary to local democracy and contrary to

the best interests of the children.

We will raise the school leaving age to sixteen as planned. Opportunities
should be given to some children, under the authority of their head teacher,

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

to take advantage in their final year of the facilities available in colleges of
further education.

We will encourage the direct grant schools. Many of these schools have an
excellent record and provide opportunities which may not otherwise be
available for children of academic ability, regardless of their parents'
income.

Parents must have the freedom to send their children to independent schools
if they wish.

The demand for higher and further education in universities, polytechnics
and other colleges will increase during the 1970s. We will expand the
number of places available.

Concern about teacher training is widespread. We will institute an inquiry
into teacher training, as the Plowden Committee recommended. We wish the
teaching profession to have a career structure which will attract recruits of
high quality into the profession, and retain them.

Care for Those in Need

Between 1951 and 1964, Conservative Governments increased pensions five
times, and the real value of the basic State pension rose by 50 per cent. We
will review retirement pensions every two years to ensure that they at least
maintain their purchasing power and that pensioners' living standards are
properly protected.

The next Conservative Government will take urgent action to give some
pension as of right to the over-eighties who now get no retirement pension at
all. We will improve the benefits payable to those who are seriously ill or
disabled, and introduce a constant attendance allowance for the most
seriously disabled. We will improve the present situation where a woman
who is just over fifty when she is widowed gets a pension but a widow just
under fifty gets nothing.

We will continue to ease the earnings rule for retirement pensions and we
will also increase the additions to the pension which can be earned by
postponing retirement beyond the minimum age.

We believe that everyone should have the opportunity of earning a pension
related to their earnings. But, in contrast to the Labour Party, our view is
that, for the great majority of people, this can and should be achieved
through the expansion and improvement of occupational schemes. And we
will ensure that everyone can take their pension rights with them when they
change their job.

There are some people who may not be covered by an occupational scheme,
and for them there will be a reserve earnings-related State scheme over and
above the basic flat-rate scheme. But this is intended as a reserve scheme,
and all approved occupational schemes will be enabled to contract out of it

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

completely under simple conditions.

Labour's complicated pension scheme would be unfair to existing pensioners
and would harm the pension prospects of the twelve-and-a-half million
members of occupational schemes. It would severely damage the growth of
savings and mean ever-increasing taxation.

Our proposals will be fair to those who are now old, and also fair to those
now working. Under Labour's scheme their pension prospects would depend
upon the willingness of future generations to pay an ever-increasing
pensions bill through mounting taxation. Under our proposal, a growing part
of the future cost of pensions will be met through genuine savings.

Retirement pensions, sickness, unemployment, widowhood and industrial
injuries benefits will continue to be paid as of right, and without means tests,
in return for National Insurance contributions. These contributions will be
graduated according to earnings, and the present flat-rate contributions -
which have become a heavy burden on the lower paid during recent years -
will be abolished.

We will lower the age at which public service and armed forces pension
increases become payable to fifty-five, and the pensions of those who retired
before 1956 will be brought up to the same level as if they had retired then
with appropriate increases since. The purchasing power of public service
pensions will also be protected by a two-yearly review. Special treatment
will be given to war pensioners and their widows.

We will take firm action to deal with abuse of the social security system. We
will tighten up the administration so as to prevent the whole system being
brought into disrepute by the shirkers and the scroungers.

We will tackle the problem of family poverty and ensure that adequate
family allowances go to those families that need them. A scheme based upon
negative income tax would allow benefits to be related to family need; other
families would benefit by reduced taxation. The Government has
exaggerated the administrative problems involved, and we will make a real
effort to find a practical solution. If this can be done, it will increase
incentive for those at work, and bring much-needed help to children living in
poverty.

We welcome the recently announced improved rates of supplementary
benefit.

More emphasis is required on the provision of care for the elderly, the
chronic sick and handicapped people, and particularly on the expansion of
those services which provide help in the home. We welcomed the Seebohm
Report's recommendations on local authority social services and supported
the legislation which followed. We will, in consultation with the local
authorities, improve local social services so that help is more readily
available to those in need.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 18 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

We recognise the important contribution to social welfare that volunteers and
voluntary organisations are already making, and we believe there is scope
for considerable expansion and development. We are convinced that many of
the social problems that now scar society can only be solved through a
genuine partnership of effort between statutory and voluntary organisations -
between the professional and the volunteer.

We will give active support, both financially and legislatively, so that new
opportunities may be created in co-operation with the local authorities for all
those - and in particular the young people and the retired people - who want
to do voluntary social work.

As a result of the slow rate of economic growth under Labour, the resources
going into the Health Service are inadequate. There are too many outdated
hospitals, too many old people not getting the care they need in their own
homes, too many mentally ill people either in overcrowded hospital wards or
getting insufficient care through local community services. And too many of
those working in the health service lack a decent career structure.

We will improve the administration of the health service so that its three
main branches - hospitals, general practitioners, and local health services -
are better co-ordinated. This will mean better value for money and better
care for the patient. We will also improve the ways of dealing with
suggestions and complaints from both patients and staff.

In forward planning for health, we will put more emphasis on community
services. This will enable more people to be looked after at home where they
are happier, rather than n hospitals and residential institutions. We will
increase the number of health centres and encourage more group practice to
improve the working conditions for doctors.

Labour see 'danger' in the growth of private provision in health and welfare.
We believe it right and proper that people should be free to provide for
themselves and their families if they wish.

Race Relations and Immigration

Good race relations are of immense importance. We are determined that all
citizens shall continue to be treated as equal before the law, and without
discrimination. Our policies for education, health and housing will help to
reduce the causes of racial tension. The sooner prosperity returns, the sooner
additional resources will be available to tackle the problems of poverty,
decay and squalor in our towns and cities. Local authority services are under
great strain in many of the towns and cities where large numbers of
immigrants have settled. We believe that additional funds should be made
available to these local authorities in order that they can deal with these
problems effectively without placing heavy burdens on their ratepayers.

We will establish a new single system of control over all immigration from
overseas. The Home Secretary of the day will have complete control, subject
to the machinery for appeal, over the entry of individuals into Britain. We

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 12:40

Page 19 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

believe it right to allow an existing Commonwealth immigrant who is
already here to bring his wife and young children to join him in this country.
But for the future, work permits will not carry the right of permanent
settlement for the holder or his dependants. Such permits as are issued will
be limited to a specific job in a specific area for a fixed period, normally
twelve months. There will of course be no restrictions on travel.

These policies mean that future immigration will be allowed only in strictly
defined special cases. There will be no further large scale permanent
immigration.

We will give assistance to Commonwealth immigrants who wish to return to
their countries of origin, but we will not tolerate any attempt to harass or
compel them to go against their will.

Government and the Citizen

The Government in Whitehall is overloaded, and as a result people in the
regions grow increasingly impatient about the decisions being made in
London which they know could be better made locally. Under our new style
of government, we will devolve government power so that more decisions
are made locally.

Scotland, with its distinct identity, traditions and legal system, is particularly
conscious of these problems.

The Report of the Committee set up under Sir Alec Douglas-Home offers a
new chance for the Scottish people to have a greater say in their own affairs.
Its contents, including the proposal for a Scottish Convention sitting in
Edinburgh, will form a basis for the proposals we will place before
Parliament, taking account of the impending re-organisation of local
government.

We are publishing separate manifestos for Scotland and Wales.

We reaffirm that no change will be made in the constitutional status of
Northern Ireland without the free consent of the Parliament of Northern
Ireland.

We support the Northern Ireland Government in its programme of legislative
and executive action to ensure equal opportunity for all citizens in that part
of the United Kingdom. We will provide the military and other aid necessary
to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary in keeping the peace and ensuring
freedom under the law; with the Ulster Defence Regiment as a strong and
efficient reserve force capable of playing a significant role in maintaining
peace and security.

The independence of local authorities has been seriously eroded by Labour
Ministers. On many issues, particularly in education and housing, they have
deliberately overridden the views of elected councillors. We think it wrong
that the balance of power between central and local government should have

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 20 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

been distorted, and we will redress the balance and increase the
independence of local authorities.

We are convinced of the need for reform of the present structure of local
government. Unfortunately, the Terms of Reference given to the Redcliffe-
Maud and Wheatley Royal Commissions which examined this problem in
England and in Scotland respectively were restricted. As a result, the crucial
questions of devolution of power from the central government and of local
government finance were not adequately dealt with in their Reports. We
believe that these matters must be considered and that those concerned in
local government must be fully consulted before final decisions are made.

We will bring forward a sensible measure of local government reform which
will involve a genuine devolution of power from the central government and
will provide for the existence of a two-tier structure. There will be full
consultation about the pattern of boundaries and the effect of changes upon
existing resources of local government

We will ensure that the legitimate interests of existing local government staff
are fully safeguarded in any changes made in the structure of local
government. Similarly, reductions in the number of civil servants can be
achieved by restricting recruitment and allowing the normal processes of
retirement and resignation to reduce numbers. Adequate financial
compensation will be paid to any civil servant or local government officer
made redundant, and the career prospects of those who are transferred will
be safeguarded.

Traditionally, changes in Parliamentary constituency boundaries are made on
the recommendation of the impartial Boundaries Commission. The Labour
Government has broken this tradition in order to gain an unfair advantage at
this election. We will return to the previous honest and fair system.

Freedom Under the Law

Protection of the individual citizen is a prime duty of government. Urgent
action is needed to check the serious rise in crime and violence. The Labour
Government cannot entirely shrug off responsibility for the present situation
since they restricted police recruitment at a critical time.

The best deterrent to crime is the likelihood of being caught. We will
strengthen the police force. We will restore the prison building programme,
taking special care to provide secure detention for the most dangerous
criminals.

In some respects the law needs modernising and clarifying, and needs to be
made less slow and cumbersome, particularly for dealing with offences -
forcible entry, obstruction and violent offences concerned with public order -
peculiar to the age of demonstration and disruption. A Conservative
Government will do this.

We will also change the law so that the demonstrator who uses violence, or

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 21 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

the criminal who causes personal injury or damages property, will be obliged
to compensate his victim in addition to fines or other punishments imposed
by the Courts.

A tolerant and civilised society must continue to permit its citizens to
assemble, march and demonstrate in support of the ideals and principles they
believe in. Our purpose is to protect the citizen against disruption of lawful
activities and, to that end, we will immediately institute an inquiry into the
law affecting trespass. Such a reform of the law would in no way inhibit the
peaceful use of the right to demonstrate or strike.

We will eliminate unnecessary secrecy concerning the workings of the
Government, and we will review the operation of the Official Secrets Act so
that government is more open and more accountable to the public.

The functions and powers of government have expanded so much in recent
years that the traditional safeguards for the citizen no longer suffice.
Although we will reduce government activity and interference, a better
system of control and examination of decisions by civil servants, public
bodies and local authorities which affect individual citizens is also needed.
Parliament during recent years has often passed government legislation
which has infringed individual rights and given wide discretionary powers to
Ministers and their civil servants. We will closely examine ways of
safeguarding more effectively and equitably the rights and freedom of the
individual citizen.

A Conservative Government introduced equal pay for women in the teaching
profession, in local government, and in the non-industrial Civil Service in
the 1950s. We have supported and sought to improve the equal pay
legislation.

But this alone does not ensure genuine equality of opportunity. Many
barriers still exist which prevent women from participating to the full in the
entire life of the country. Women are treated by the law, in some respects, as
having inferior rights to men, we will amend the law to remove this
discrimination.

We will clear away the remaining anomalies in family law and make fairer
provision for women in the event of separation or bereavement. We will help
deserted wives by improving the enforcement of maintenance orders.

A Better Environment

Economic growth and technological innovation are the principal means of
achieving a continuing improvement in our standard of living. But the
effects of technological change can sometimes lead to a deterioration in the
natural environment and in the quality of life. The public are rightly
concerned about these dangers.

We will improve the machinery of government for dealing with these
problems. We will review existing legislation to ensure proper and sensible

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 22 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

control in the future. The damage of the past must be repaired. The worst
scars are in and around our industrial cities and towns. We will ensure that
the natural beauty of our British countryside and seashore is conserved and
wild life is allowed to flourish.

We intend to launch a major campaign in which government, local
authorities and voluntary organisations will combine to produce a healthier,
pleasanter Britain. We will vigorously pursue international agreements for
the safeguarding and improvement of the environment. We will set clearly
defined aims and target-dates for the achievement of cleaner air and rivers,
and for the clearance of derelict land.

The Arts, Broadcasting and Sport

We will continue to give full financial support and encouragement to the
Arts. The Arts Council will be strengthened so that it can take a more active
role in stimulating regional co-operation and in establishing effective
regional arts associations. Local authorities will be encouraged to play a
larger role in patronage of the Arts. We recognise the vital importance of
private patronage. We will devote special attention to those areas of artistic
life such as museums and music colleges which face particularly acute
problems.

We believe that people are as entitled to an alternative radio service as to an
alternative television service. We will permit local private enterprise radio
under the general supervision of an independent broadcasting authority.
Local institutions, particularly local newspapers, will have the opportunity of
a stake in local radio, which we want to see closely associated with the local
community.

We will ensure that the British Broadcasting Corporation continues to make
its effective and essential public service contribution in both television and
sound broadcasting. Equally, we will ensure that the independent television
companies are not prevented from providing a responsible service by too
high a government levy on their income.

The Sports Council is fulfilling an important function in carrying out
research and advising the Government on capital investment in recreation by
local authorities, and on grant-aid to voluntary organisations. We will make
the Sports Council an independent body, and make it responsible for the
grant-aiding functions at present exercised by the Government.

A Stronger Britain in The World

If we can negotiate the right terms, we believe that it would be in the long-
term interest of the British people for Britain to join the European Economic
Community, and that it would make a major contribution to both the
prosperity and the security of our country. The opportunities are immense.
Economic growth and a higher standard of living would result from having a
larger market.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 23 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

But we must also recognise the obstacles. There would be short-term
disadvantages in Britain going into the European Economic Community
which must be weighed against the long-term benefits. Obviously there is a
price we would not be prepared to pay. Only when we negotiate will it be
possible to determine whether the balance is a fair one, and in the interests of
Britain.

Our sole commitment is to negotiate; no more, no less. As the negotiations
proceed we will report regularly through Parliament to the country.

A Conservative Government would not be prepared to recommend to
Parliament, nor would Members of Parliament approve, a settlement which
was unequal or unfair. In making this judgement, Ministers and Members
will listen to the views of their constituents and have in mind, as is natural
and legitimate, primarily the effect of entry upon the standard of living of the
individual citizens whom they represent.

We will stand by our alliances and strengthen our defences. We will continue
to make our contribution to the forces of NATO and will seek to revitalise
this organisation which is basic to the defence of Britain.

In the past, British forces in the Gulf, and in Singapore and Malaysia, have
helped to ensure stability beneficial to the countries concerned and without
which Britain's valuable interests would not have flourished. By unilaterally
deciding to withdraw our forces from these areas by the end of 1971, the
Labour Government have broken their promises to the Governments and
peoples of these areas, and are exposing these British interests and the future
of Britain's friends to unacceptable risk.

We have proposed a five-power defence force to help maintain peace and
stability in South-East Asia. We will discuss this with our allies and
Commonwealth friends - Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.
Similar talks will be held with leaders in the Gulf.

We are satisfied that all these peacetime defence needs can be fulfilled by
our Regular forces without the need for conscription. We deplore the
destruction of the Territorial Army, and will provide adequate volunteer
reserve forces for the defence and security of these islands.

We believe that Britain must in the last resort retain independent control of
its nuclear weapons to deter an aggressor; as at present, those assigned to
NATO can be withdrawn if supreme national interests are at stake.

We will foster the development of official and unofficial links within the
Common wealth, believing that this unique organisation can be a force for
peace and understanding. We believe that the independence of each of its
members must be respected, and that their internal affairs and individual
responsibilities are matters for their individual decision alone, and that
jointly they should only consider those matters freely agreed upon as being
of common interest.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 24 of 26

1970 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

We will give the United Nations full, constructive but not uncritical support.
We will seek to build on its successes and to remedy its shortcomings. We
intend to go on working for sound schemes of disarmament and arms
control.

Labour has failed to solve the Rhodesian problem, to the detriment of all
concerned. We will make a further effort to find a sensible and lasting
solution in accordance with the five principles which we have consistently
maintained.

Britain must play a proper part in dealing with world poverty. We will ensure
that Britain helps the developing countries:

¢ by working for the expansion of international trade;

¢ by encouraging private investment overseas;

¢ by providing capital aid and technical assistance to supplement their
own efforts.

We have accepted the UNCTAD target for aid to developing countries, and
will increase the British programme as national prosperity returns. We will
re-examine the objectives and performance of the programme so that the
maximum mutual advantage is gained.

The Choice

The choice before the electors today is not just between policies and
programmes. It is about the way of life our country shall follow in the next
five years, and far beyond that.

In purely practical terms, it is a choice between another five years of the kind
of incompetent, doctrinaire Government we have had for nearly six years
and a new and better style of Government.

Faced with any problem, the instinctive Socialist reaction is to control, to
restrict, and to tax. We aim to reduce the burden of taxation, and to extend
individual choice, freedom and responsibility.

Socialists believe in the extension of the power of the State: government
today is trying to do too much, managing too much, bringing too much to
the centre for decision. We plan to clear away from Whitehall a great load of
tasks which has accumulated under Socialism; to hand back responsibilities
wherever we can to the individual, to the family, to private initiative, to the
local authority, to the people.

It is also a choice between a Government which by its conduct has done
much to discredit the value of the politician's word, and an alternative
Government which is deter mined to restore honesty and integrity to political
life.

Under a Conservative Government, the gap between the politician's promise
and government performance will be closed, so that people and government

can be brought together again in one nation united in a common purpose - a
better tomorrow.

1966 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

Action Not Words: The New Conservative
Programme

Foreword

I present to the people of Britain a manifesto which is also a blueprint It is a
blueprint not for a year but for a full Parliament. I am deter mined to
promise nothing that we cannot achieve. I know that we shall inherit from
the Labour Government a weak economic position, and I intend to give first
priority to the management of our economy, to the strengthening of Britain's
competitive position in world markets and to the repayment of the heavy
burden of debt which they have incurred.

Equally I am determined to break away from the growing constraint of
Socialism and the dreariness which stems from it: from the pattern of
inflation and stagnant production which has been created.

I want to see our social services recognise the overriding claims of those in
most need. I want to see choice become once more part of the pattern of life
of the individual. I want to see our country with confidence in itself and in
the future taking its place in the European Economic Community.

These are the things we must achieve. This manifesto points the way. I ask
now for your confidence so that we can put it into effect I call not for words
- but for action.

Edward Heath

Our new Conservative Programme

This is what we are going to do:

¢ Get the economy straight, check rising prices, and restore expansion.
Reform the trade unions.

Remodel the Welfare State.

Get the nation properly housed.

The Labour Record

In October 1964 the Labour Government came to power promising action.
Since then we have had many more promises. And many words. But the one
thing we have not had is action. For eighteen months we have been waiting
while the Labour leaders talk. But their words have had little relation to the
facts.

The Labour Government has had its opportunity and it has failed. It's easy
enough to say 'Let's be fair to Labour. Give them another chance.' But it
would be taking an immense chance with everybody's future to do so. We
cannot afford to sit and wait for the other failures and blunders that will be
coming our way if Labour is left in charge.

Just look at their record. The Labour leaders have failed to tackle the
fundamental economic and social problems at home. Abroad Britain's
reputation has declined under their clumsy and uncertain touch. In the High
Street prices are rising. Up go rates and taxes, down go standards of service
on the buses and trains and in other public industries. The road programme
is held up. The universities and technical colleges have had to cut back their
expansion plans. The housing target has been missed. Mortgage rates are
higher than ever. Complicated tax penalties are sapping individual
enterprise. Production in industry is stagnating.

It is a depressing catalogue. It is hard to see how any one of us, whatever our
job or whatever our attitude to politics, can be satisfied with the situation
into which we have now drifted. Nor can anyone be content to let this sort of
thing go on. This is not the kind of Britain we want.

All those who really believe in this country must know in their hearts that
we can do far, far better, given energy and imagination. And not only for
ourselves, but for our families, our communities and for the millions
overseas who rely on a strong and free Britain.

The Conservative Way Ahead

The alternative to Labour drift is less talk and gimmickry, and more positive
action. The alternative is a government team which means what it says and
knows what it intends to do: a government that doesn't run away; an honest
government.

Our first aim is this: to run this country's affairs efficiently and realistically
so that we achieve steadier prices in the shops, high wages and a really
decent standard of social security.

With sensible and determined action and our new Conservative policies we
can reach these goals. But we have to be quite clear what this means. It
means that we must give every man and woman a chance to play a decisive
and worthwhile part in restoring Britain's health and strength and confidence.
It means that our best brains must be encouraged and rewarded so that they

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1966/1966-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 14

1966 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

can get on and succeed. It means that there must be a war on inefficiency
and waste in the public industries - as well as in Whitehall and in the town
hall. It means that pride, self-confidence and efficiency must replace the
suspicion and the 'who cares?’ attitude which weaken industry and hold us
all back.

Now to get to these goals here are the action programmes which we will be
starting on as soon as we form a government.

¢ First the next Conservative Government will not hesitate to take all
the measures necessary to deal with the immediate economic situation.
Our new economic programme will make a prices and incomes policy
really effective.

¢ Second, we will use tax incentives to encourage individual men and
women to earn and save more for themselves and their families.

¢ Third, our new policies for competition will inject fresh vitality into
British industry, keeping prices down and quality up, and giving the
housewife the service she deserves.

¢ Fourth, we will be launching new industrial policies, involving major
reforms of both management and unions. At last the barriers in the
way of higher productivity and higher earnings will be brought down.

¢ Fifth, we will be making big changes in the organisation of our
government and public services.

¢ Sixth, we will start new programmes for speeding up the spread of
prosperity to the English regions, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland.

e Seventh, the strategy of the new Conservative Government will be to
throw everything this country has in skill, resources and brainpower
behind the things at which Britain is best. We intend to see British
quality again become the pace-setter in world markets and British
services again become the envy of the world. And we intend to bring
in the men who can do the job.

We intend to reform both British management and British trade unions.

Everyone is fed up with pointless strikes and outdated management. We
reject the argument that there is a clash between the interests of management
and workpeople. Higher wages, good profits and competitive products are in
the interests of both. Efficient production and stable prices are what the
customer wants.

Here are the action programmes we shall be introducing to bring this about.

¢ First, we will be transforming industrial relations by introducing a
new Act covering the trade unions and employers' associations.

¢ Second, we will be turning the heat on restrictive practices by both
management and labour so that men and women can do a decent job
unhampered by the fears and restrictions which belong to another age.

¢ Third, we want to see better job prospects with greater security of
incomes and pensions in the new high-wage low-cost economy.

1966 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

We intend to revitalise our Welfare State so that those most in need get the
most help and so that our money is used sensibly and fairly. We will be
working to a fresh pattern of social priorities to meet new needs and help
build our community on more responsible lines.

We want to see more generous help for those who have special needs not yet
met by the Welfare State. We want to see family life strengthened by our
Conservative social policies. We intend that there should be full equality of
opportunity but not that we should all be equally held back to the pace of the
slowest. Our policies are designed to bring higher quality and wider choice
into our lives. We reject the kind of outdated thinking which leads to cuts in
university and college expansion in order to provide free drugs for all.

Here are the action programmes which make up the new Conservative social
policy and which will fulfil our aims.

¢ First, an entirely new social security strategy designed to concentrate
better care and the biggest benefits on those most in need.

¢ Second, wider ownership - not only of houses but of pension rights
and other forms of capital as well.

¢ Third, full educational opportunity, putting the needs of the individual
child before Party doctrine. The first thing is to get more colleges and
schools built, particularly primary schools, and more teachers trained.

¢ Fourth, an all out attack on the rising wave of crime which today
besmirches our society.

¢ Fifth, fair treatment for immigrants combined with stricter control of
entry.

¢ Sixth, more regional administration with strong and modernised local
government.

e Seventh, better conditions for the car driver, the commuter and the
travelling public generally.

¢ Finally, a countryside preserved where it is beautiful and transformed
where it is ugly and derelict.

We intend to see that this entire nation is decently housed.

Our aim is more choice in housing. We are determined to see house prices in
reach of those eager to buy homes of their own. We are determined to see
that the needs of people for rented accommodation are more effectively met.

Here are the action programmes we intend to launch.

¢ First we will raise the housing target to an annual rate of 500,000
homes by the end of 1968. We reached our target before, and we will
hit it again. We will make use of every new method that works to get
the houses up and keep the prices down. And there will be major
reforms in planning procedure to increase the supply of land for
building.

¢ Second, we will encourage more people to buy their own homes - by
aid with deposits or help with interest payments or by assisting with
the purchase of older houses.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1966/1966-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 14

1966 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

¢ Third, the next Conservative Government will speed up council house
building for slum areas. And we will insist on sensible local authority
rent policies.

We are determined to give Britain a respected place in the world again and
lead her into the European Community.

Britain must be part of a wider grouping if she is to exert her full influence
in the world. British industry must have far bigger markets if it is to develop
on the scale required in so many cases by modern technology.

This can best be achieved by Britain becoming a member of an enlarged
European Economic Community to which she herself has so much to
contribute.

A strong Britain can provide a powerful trading partner, and a growing
source of skill, knowledge and capital, for the other members of the
Commonwealth. This way also lies the best chance of Britain helping the
developing countries.

That is why we shall seize the first favourable opportunity of becoming a
member of the Community.

These are our aims. The detailed proposals which follow show how we will
achieve them.

Together they form a powerful new strategy-based on sound Conservative
principles - to replace words with action, and promises with achievements.

Blueprint for a Parliament

To Ensure Prosperity with Steadier Prices

Get taxes down again so as to encourage hard work and enterprise.

Encourage wider ownership. Drastically revise Labour's ill-prepared tax
changes which penalise saving and go-ahead companies.

Get better management by improving management education at all levels.

Reform company law-doing the whole job instead of Labour's inadequate
proposals.

Mount a new attack on restrictive business practices which hurt the public
interest. Close the legal loop-holes Labour have left open.

Speed up and give more punch to the Monopolies Commission. And cut
tariffs wherever it can be shown that competition from abroad is needed to
deal with monopolies.

Set up a Small Business Development Bureau to help small firms start and

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1966/1966-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 14

1966 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

grow.

Step up opportunities to train and retrain for better, more highly paid jobs.
Build up the Youth Employment Service into a Careers Advisory Service for
adults as well as young people.

Help the housewife with new legislation on misleading 'guarantees' and
more vigorous use of safety standards for food and household goods.

Abolish the out-dated restrictions on the hours during which shops can open
on week days.

Start a new drive to put the customer first in the nationalised industries and
to increase efficiency in these and other public services.

Stimulate the new technological industries at which Britain excels. Provide
the aerospace industry with a stable long-term programme based on
European co-operation.

Stop the war in Whitehall between rival economic Ministers with conflicting
policies. Put one man in charge with one firm policy which hangs together.

Start a war on waste in Government. Establish a Cost Effectiveness
Department to introduce new management techniques into all Government
Departments. Use sophisticated computer techniques to study the feasibility
of Government projects.

Make greater use of the knowledge available in the universities and industry
in the formation of Government policy. In particular, enlist scientists, the

universities and industrial consultants to help us prevent waste of taxpayers'
money.

To Improve Industrial Relations

Pass a new Industrial Relations Act and establish a new Code of Good
Industrial Relations Practice.

Ensure that agreements between unions and employers are kept by making
them legally enforceable.

Establish a Registrar of trade unions and employers' associations. See that
their rules are fair and meet the interests of the public.

Set up a new Industrial Court to deal with industrial disputes and claims for
damages against unjust dismissal.

Introduce measures to deal with restrictive labour practices.

Repeal the Trade Disputes Act 1965 so as to help prevent intimidation.

To Provide Better Transport

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1966/1966-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 14

1966 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

Speed up the building of motorways with the aid of increased productivity in
the road building industry.

Resume the task of increasing railway efficiency and of reducing the railway
deficit.

Give independent airlines new opportunities to develop inter-city services.

Improve the traffic flow of big cities and the efficiency of public transport by
traffic management and by building off-street parking.

Get on with the modernisation of our ports. End the casual employment

system. Reduce the number of different employers. Improve working
relations - for example, see that better welfare facilities are provided.

To Help Agriculture

Give Britain's farmers scope to supply a bigger share of the home market for
food.

Move over gradually from Exchequer deficiency payments to a system of
import control.

Maintain the support given by the Agriculture Acts throughout the transition
stage, and ensure continued support in any legislation required to implement

our new proposals.

Keep production grants and special help (e.g. small farms, farm
improvements and hill farms).

Modernise the main horticultural markets, give continued support to co-
operation and encourage better marketing techniques.

To Get into Europe

Work energetically for entry into the European Common Market at the first
favourable opportunity.

Prepare for entry by relating the development of our own policies to those of
the Common Market, wherever appropriate.

Encourage co-operation with other European countries in joint projects

which need not await our membership of the Common Market: particularly
where large-scale scientific and technological resources are called for.

To Provide Most Care for Those in Need

See that everyone has a good pension with their job, on top of the State basic
pension.

Ensure that everyone can either transfer or preserve their pension when they

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1966/1966-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 14

1966 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40
change jobs.

Give more generous help to children in families where the income is below
minimum need, to the very old, to the chronic sick, to the severely disabled
and to others most in need.

Improve rehabilitation and retraining for the disabled.

Help people who have put by some savings, by raising the amount which
can be disregarded before a supplementary pension is granted.

Continue to ease the earnings rule.
Provide a pension for those too old to be covered by National Insurance.

Combine the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Pensions and National
Insurance and the National Assistance Board into a single Department with
local officers who would have a positive duty to seek out those needing help
whether in cash or in care. The new Department would have a research
organisation to pin-point changing needs.

Establish inspectors of welfare to improve co-ordination between local
authority, hospital and voluntary services.

Encourage voluntary service.

End the present rigid age barrier of 50 which prevents some widows who
have been out of employment for many years from getting any pension at
all.

Give special help to areas where there is the most need - for example, bad
housing and oversized school classes.

Restore - subject to wide exemptions (such as the elderly, chronic sick,
disabled, expectant and nursing mothers) - prescription charges. Use the
savings for higher social priorities including the hospital and medical
service.

Improve the health service by giving family doctors closer contact with
hospitals and with local health and welfare services. Improve conditions for
doctors.

Review all public service and Armed Forces pensions every two years to
ensure that they maintain their purchasing power. Reduce to 55 the age at
which increased pensions become payable. Bring the pensions of those who
retired before 1956 up to the same level as if they had retired then with
appropriate increases since. Give special treatment to war pensioners and
their widows.

To Provide Better Edcuation

Get more teachers especially for the primary schools by expanding the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1966/1966-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 14

1966 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

Colleges of Education, enabling part-time teachers to qualify for pension,
and giving more encouragement to married women who want to return to
teaching.

See that more teaching aids are made available.

Give back to local authorities the freedom to make small improvements, for
example, an extra classroom or better sanitation.

Encourage local education authorities to provide as full a range of courses as
possible in all their secondary schools.

Judge proposals for reorganisation on their educational merits. Strongly
oppose hasty and makeshift plans, especially in the big cities, for turning
good grammar and secondary modern schools into comprehensive schools.

Give improvements to primary school accommodation priority over projects
for building new comprehensive schools where adequate secondary
accommodation already exists.

Give parents as much choice as possible by having diversity in the pattern of
education. Give independent schools of high standing the opportunity to
become direct grant schools, thus narrowing the gap between State schools
and fee paying schools.

Establish an Educational Television Centre to encourage the best use of
television - broadcast and closed circuit - in schools, colleges and
universities.

Restore the university and further education buildings programmes cut by
the Labour Government.

To House the Nation

Speed up house building. Reach our target of a rate of 500,000 new homes a
year by the end of 1968. Use modern building methods and speed up
planning procedures.

Help home buyers by these three methods, as appropriate:

¢ Helping with their deposits.

e Enabling people below the standard rate of tax who are buying their
home to deduct from the interest payments on their mortgages an
amount similar to the tax relief obtained by those who pay tax. People
eligible for the present tax allowance will have the option of
continuing it.

e Introducing again the scheme for Exchequer help for the buying of
older houses through the Building Societies.

¢ Give home buyers a guarantee of good workmanship.

¢ Accelerate housing for the elderly.

¢ See that council house subsidies are concentrated on those who really

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1966/1966-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 14

1966 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

need them.

¢ Increase council house building for slum clearance.

¢ Expand the work of Housing Associations, so as to provide more good
homes, at reasonable prices.

¢ Introduce depreciation allowances to help provide more homes to rent.

¢ Maintain rent control where there is a shortage of houses.

¢ Legislate to allow ground leaseholders to buy or rent their houses on
fair terms except where the property is to be redeveloped.

¢ Take £100 million off the rates - equivalent to one-tenth of the rate
bill.

To Beat the Crime Wave

Place responsibility for law and order and for the war against crime on the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland.

Set up a central staff within the Home Office responsible for police strategy,
intelligence and equipment.

Accelerate the amalgamation of local police forces and establish a clear
chain of command. Within a national force of this kind, local loyalties can

and will be preserved.

Ensure that the police have the organisation, manpower and equipment to do
the job.

Make offenders pay restitution for the injuries and damage they have done.
Replace many short term sentences by substantial fines.

Preserve the Juvenile Courts and expand the methods available for dealing
with the problems of young people.

Train those in prison to become useful members of the community.
To Deal with the Problem of Immigration

Ensure that all immigrants living in Britain are treated in all respects as
equal citizens and without discrimination.

Introduce a conditional entry system which will control the initial time
during which a new immigrant may stay, until permission is granted either
permanently or for a further limited period.

Strengthen the arrangements for health checks for immigrants.

Require all immigrants to register the names of any dependants who might at
any time wish to join them, so that their numbers will be known. In the case
of new immigrants the number of dependants will be an important factor in
deciding whether entry will be permitted.

Help immigrants already here to rejoin their families in their countries of

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1966/1966-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 14

1966 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

origin, or to return with their families to these countries, if they so wish.

Combine stricter control of entry with special help where necessary to those
areas where immigrants are concentrated.

To Build a Better Country and Widen Opportunities for
Recreation

Plan the coast and countryside in such a way as to increase their natural
beauty, increase the holiday attractions of Britain, and encourage provision
for the growing numbers who leave the towns to sail, ski, climb, picnic or go
caravaning.

Create a new Coast and Countryside Commission with the powers to get on
with the job, using the resources of both public authorities and private
enterprise.

Open more inland water for recreation, provide more access for visitors to
the National Forests, and secure a national network of camping and caravan

sites.

Encourage the development of regional recreation areas, largely financed by
private investment, on the model of the Lea Valley Scheme.

End the existing confusion and duplication of effort between at least five
Ministries in Whitehall, by setting up within the Ministry of Housing and
Local Government a Recreation Department.

Provide more choice and competition in broadcasting.

Encourage the arts, particularly in the provinces. Promote high standards of
architecture and civic planning.

To Deal with the Special Problems of Each Area

Develop fully the resources of each region and maintain its character in
consultation with local organisations. Accelerate action on regional studies.

Develop the growth zone idea which Labour has abandoned. Strengthen the
public services in these areas by greater investment in communications,
homes, schools and hospitals. Provide financial inducements for new
industry.

Improve amenities: provide powers to clear away the industrial dereliction
of yesterday.

To Bring New Prosperity to Scotland

Expand Government Training Centres and technical education programmes
in order to provide the new skills which our new industries need.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1966/1966-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 14

1966 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

Make a greater allocation of funds for education in the Highlands, the
Borders and other country areas.

Concentrate development in those areas where it is most needed and will do
the most good.

Restore the cuts which the Labour Government has made in Scottish road-
building and pursue policies which will stop transport costs rising so fast.

Encourage competition on Scottish air routes and ensure that the Highlands
have services timed to suit the people who live and work there.

Make a top priority the clearance of the remaining slums in Glasgow,
Edinburgh, Dundee and other cities by every type of building - private
building, council building and housing associations.

Introduce sensible rent schemes for local authority housing.

Make the best use of our land resources outside the central belt by
supporting the hill farmers, encouraging the expansion of forestry and

planning special tourist areas.

Make the Scottish Tourist Board a more professional body and use it to
stimulate the growth of the industry.

Modernise local government and its finance.
To Bring New Prosperity to Wales

Tackle the problem of depopulation in mid-Wales by constructing first class
road communications from Shrewsbury to Cardigan Bay, by attracting new
industries, and by revitalising existing towns and developing mid-Wales as

an area of high amenity and a tourist attraction.

Develop the coastal road in North Wales from Queensferry to Caernarvon.

Encourage new industrial development in North and South Wales and the
development of the South Wales ports under a group system.

Give special attention to the needs of the hill farming community.
Maintain a Secretary for Wales in the Cabinet.
Overhaul the structure and organisation of Local Government in Wales.

Legislate to allow ground leaseholders to buy or rent their houses on fair
terms except where the property is to be redeveloped.

Expand higher education in Wales and grant independent status to each
university college. The university college of Cardiff, the Welsh college of
Advanced Technology and the National School of Medicine will form the
Civic University of Cardiff.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1966/1966-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 14

1966 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

Encourage and foster the culture and arts which are the characteristic of the
Welsh people.

To Bring New Prosperity to Northern Ireland

Co-operate with the Northern Ireland Government in:

¢ Seeing that Northern Ireland, as an integral part of the U.K., shares
fully in the economic growth of the rest of the country; in particular,
that the counties west of the Bann share in growing prosperity.

¢ Improving basic services, such as the new road programmes now
being planned.

¢ Offering inducements to new industry to raise employment.

¢ Promoting the interests of Ulster farmers, bearing particularly in mind
the size of holdings and their distance from the rest of the British
market.

To Strengthen the Commonwealth

Break the deadlock in Rhodesia by initiating talks with Mr. Smith and his
colleagues for the purpose of obtaining a constitutional settlement, without
any prior conditions on either side.

Strengthen and expand existing Commonwealth links by making full use of
the Commonwealth Foundation, by encouraging the professional, legal,
medical and educational Commonwealth Conferences and by acting on their
recommendations where appropriate.

Encourage voluntary service overseas.

Help Commonwealth development by technical and other assistance, by
joint or bi-lateral projects and by ensuring that all aid given is used to its
maximum effect.

Work for the expansion of world and Commonwealth trade through the U.N.
Trade and Development Board and the Kennedy Round tariff negotiations.

To Help Preserve World Peace

Make our contribution to NATO. Fulfil our treaty obligations in the Middle
and Far East.

Maintain a combination of nuclear and conventional arms related to our
financial resources to enable us to defend ourselves and to honour these
commitments. In particular, go on with the building of the new aircraft
carrier.

Maintain properly equipped Regular forces together with reserve forces -

including the Territorial Army - suitable reorganised for their supporting
roles.

1966 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

Seek, with our allies, every means and opportunity of bringing an end to
hostilities in the Far East, thus reducing the pressure on our resources in that
area.

Seek to make the United Nations a more effective instrument for keeping
peace.

Renew Conservative support for the admission of Communist China to the
United Nations.

Give a new impetus to disarmament by pressing for an extension of the

1964 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

""Prosperity With A Purpose""

Foreword

by Sir Alec Douglas-Home

As Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party, I submit this Manifesto to
my fellow countrymen and women.

Its object is to declare the principles for which Conservatives stand and to
show how we propose to translate them into action. Part of it is a record of
achievement, and that is deliberate. For work well done carries conviction
that our policies for the future will succeed. Our philosophy is to use what is
good from the past to create a future which is better.

But these pages are not an introduction to an easy, sheltered life. No country
has an inherited right to wealth or influence. Prosperity has to be worked for.
The future will be assured only if our people recognise the simple economic
rules which must be kept by a country dependent on earning its living in a
competitive world. This manifesto points the way.

Throughout, you will find a constant theme. It is the creation of a social and
economic climate in which men and women can develop their personalities
and talents to their country's benefit as well as their own. Conservatives
believe that a centralised system of direction cramps the style of the British
people. Only by trusting the individual with freedom and responsibility shall
we gain the vitality to keep our country great.

Such greatness is not measured in terms of prosperity alone. What counts is
the purpose to which we put prosperity. The Conservative purpose is clear
from our record and from our programme. It is to raise the quality of our
society and its influence for good in the world. We are using the growth of
wealth to expand opportunities for the young, to provide more generously
for the old and the sick and the handicapped, to aid developing countries still
battling against widespread poverty, and to maintain the strength on which
national security and our work for peace depend.

In a world as dangerous as that in which we live it can make no sense

whatever for Britain unilaterally to discard her strength. We therefore reject
the idea of giving up our nuclear arm. We adopt instead a balanced policy of

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1964/1964-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 21

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

strength and conciliation: strength to be used to stop wars before they start;
conciliation to reach areas of agreement with the Soviet Union and the
Communist world which will replace tension and potential conflict. The
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was one such achievement. We mean to work for
more until the danger of war is eliminated. The way will be rough but we
will persevere. I ask you to conclude that we should retain British power and
influence so that they may be used for such high purpose.

In short, I trust that the values for which Conservatives stand and the
policies which we intend to follow commend themselves to the imagination
and the common sense of the British people.

Working for Peace

Our policy of peace through strength has brought Britain safely through
years of tension and danger. it contributes to the security of the free world. It
provides the realistic basis for better relations between East and West. It
keeps this country in her rightful place at the centre of international affairs.

The Socialists, by contrast, would relegate Britain to the sidelines. They are
as always deeply divided on international and defence issues so divided that
they dared not even discuss them at their last party conference lest an open
quarrel should break out. Nuclear abdication is the only policy on which
they can unite.

Diplomacy and Disarmament

The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963 has been welcomed throughout the
world. Both the United States and the Soviet Union have acknowledged how
much it owed to the Conservative Government's initiative and perseverance.
But if Labour Party policy had been carried out, and our country had no
longer been a nuclear power, there would have been no British role to play.
We should have been without influence and without voice. The Conservative
Party will not cast away by unilateral action this vital contribution to
Britain's diplomacy and defence.

We are ready and anxious not only to stop all tests but to discard further
armaments - if other nations agree to do the same and give convincing proof
that they are doing so step by step with us. That is what we are trying to
achieve in the general disarmament negotiations. That is what we pledge
ourselves to work for.

Following upon the test ban treaty, the Russians, Americans and ourselves
have this year agreed to limit production of fissile materials for military
purposes. in accord with our allies, we shall seek other areas of agreement
with the Soviet Union-for example, on non-dissemination of nuclear
weapons and observation posts against surprise attack. It would be wrong to
raise false hopes, for the Russians are stubborn negotiators and these are
difficult matters. But we are determined to maintain the momentum of
constructive discussion which has already done much to bring nearer an end

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1964/1964-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 21

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40
to the cold war.
Defence and Deterrence

A Conservative Government will firmly uphold Britain's world-wide
interests and obligations. In recent months we have been called upon to
defend Malaysia and South Arabia and to render assistance in East Africa
and Cyprus. These crises have demonstrated the effectiveness of our defence
organisation and the skill and spirit of our fighting Services. We shall
continue to ensure that they are equipped to respond swiftly and successfully
to challenge.

Over 90 per cent. of our defence effort is devoted to conventional arms. But
in the nuclear age no money spent on increasing the size or improving the
conventional equipment of our forces could by itself secure the defence of
these islands. The only effective defence is the certainty in the mind of any
enemy that there is no prize he could ever win by our defeat which could
compensate him for the destruction he would suffer in the process.
Conservatives do not accept the view that we could never be threatened on
our own, or that an enemy will always assume we shall have allies rushing to
our side.

Britain must in the ultimate resort have independently controlled nuclear
power to deter an aggressor. We possess this power today. Only under a
Conservative Government will we possess it in the future.

We have put into practice the concept of interdependence within the Atlantic
alliance by assigning our V-bombers to Nato but subject to our right to
deploy them at discretion if supreme national interests are at stake. The
Polaris submarines when operational will be assigned in the same way and
subject to the same reservation.

Western Unity and the U.N.

We remain convinced that the political and economic problems of the West
can best be solved by an Atlantic partnership between America and a united
Europe. Only in this way can Europe develop the wealth and power, and
play the part in aiding others, to which her resources and history point the
way.

Entry into the European Economic Community is not open to us in existing
circumstances, and no question of fresh negotiations can arise at present. We
shall work, with our EFTA partners, through the Council of Europe, and
through Western European Union, for the closest possible relations with the
Six consistent with our Commonwealth ties.

The principles laid down in the Charter of the United Nations are as valid
today as when we signed it. We shall use our influence to see that these
principles are implemented. Our contribution to the U.N.'s economic and
social agencies and to its work of conciliation and peace-making is second

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1964/1964-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 21

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

only to that of the United States. We shall work for the establishment of its
present peace-keeping machinery on a more permanent basis.

The Role of the Commonwealth

The Prime Ministers' Conference this summer reflected the vigour and
increased the strength of the modern Commonwealth. In a few weeks' time it
will comprise 20 nations 13 of whom will have achieved their independence
since the Conservatives took office.

This historic evolution is now reaching its final stages. Of our remaining
dependencies many are well on the road to sovereignty. A number have
multi-racial populations presenting special problems. Others are too small to
bear the burdens of separate statehood. In each case we shall work for a fair
and practical solution which will protect the interests of the peoples
concerned.

The organisation of government in this country and the machinery of
Commonwealth co-operation will be brought into line with new conditions.

We propose next year to merge the Colonial Office with the Commonwealth
Relations Office, and it and the Foreign Office will be staffed from a single
Diplomatic Service.

We shall give full support to the Commonwealth Secretariat whose
establishment was agreed at the Prime Ministers' Conference. We also intend
to set up a Commonwealth Foundation to develop contacts between
professional bodies in the Commonwealth, and will give increased
assistance to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.

Trade and Aid

Today the Commonwealth faces two world challenges. One is political the
opportunity to show by example that peoples of different races can work
together in amity and confidence. The other is economic the need to build up
in developing territories more prosperous and hopeful conditions. We shall
succeed in the political task only if we also succeed in the economic. For it
is the gap in living standards between the industrialised and the developing
that gives racial conflict its cutting edge.

The prime need of developing countries is for trading opportunities, and here
Britain leads the world. No country is so liberal in providing them with
access to her markets. At the United Nations trade and development
conference this year we played a crucial role in securing the adoption of
recommendations to help them expand, export and earn. Our consistent aim
is wider world trade and an improved world monetary system to sustain it.

Under the Conservatives since 1951, £1,400m. has been provided in
Government aid, preponderantly to the Commonwealth. Last year it reached
the record level of £/75m., more than double what it was six years earlier.
Private investment has been providing substantial amounts. As the British

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1964/1964-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 21

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

economy expands, so the level of aid will progressively rise. We shall also
support voluntary endeavour, of which the Freedom from Hunger Campaign
has been a splendid example.

Technical Co-operation

But aid is more than money. Just as vital is the sharing of knowledge and
experience. We have multiplied our technical assistance more than sixfold in
six years. We set up the new Department of Technical Co-operation in 1961
to give impetus to this work.

More than 50,000 students from developing countries were in full-time
courses in Britain last year, while some 19,000 British men and women were
serving in the developing countries under our Government 5 auspices. An
important feature has been the growing opportunity for young people to find
scope for their energy and idealism in voluntary overseas service. Through
the initiative of voluntary organisations, and with increasing Government
support, the numbers are rising fast.

At the 1964 Commonwealth Education Conference we offered a big increase
in capital assistance for high education in the Commonwealth during the
coming five years. We shall also vigorously pursue our proposals for a
Commonwealth medical conference, and for increasing Commonwealth co-
operation in development projects and in the training of administrators.

In these ways we shall seek both to help the developing countries and to
strengthen Commonwealth links.

Growth Without Inflation

In 13 years of Conservative government the living standards of the British
people have improved more than in the whole of the previous half-century.

The working population is up by two million and over 98 per cent. are in
jobs. Rising incomes and lower taxes have made possible a spectacular
increase in spending on the essentials, the comforts and what were once
regarded as the luxuries of life. At the same time personal savings have
grown from £10Om. in 1951 to nearly £2,00Om. last year-providing funds
for the modernisation of Britain, security for the individual, and substance to
the Conservative concept of a property-owning democracy.

We do not claim that these benefits are the gift of the Government. What we
do claim is that the Government has created conditions in which individuals

by enterprise and thrift have gained these benefits for themselves and the
country. These are the conditions we shall maintain.

An Expanding Economy

We shall give first priority to our policy for economic growth, so that
Britain's national wealth can expand by a steady 4 per cent. per year.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1964/1964-conservative-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 12:40

Page 5 of 21

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

We recognise that this involves a high level of imports, and we are prepared
to draw on our reserves whilst our exports, both visible and invisible,
achieve a balance with them. By new arrangements with the International
Monetary Fund, the European banks and the United States, we have
strengthened the defences of sterling against speculative attack which could
put a brake on progress.

But the long-term problem of the balance of payments can only be solved by
bringing our trading economy to the highest pitch of competitiveness and
modern efficiency.

Exports and Prices

We have improved the services provided for export firms, given them the
fullest credit insurance facilities in the world, and established the National
Export Council to aid their efforts. But basically our capacity to sell abroad
depends on competitive prices.

No country has succeeded in keeping post-war prices completely steady, but
Britain in recent years has done far better than most. Our aim is an economy
in which earnings rise in step with productivity and do not outpace it. An
effective and fair incomes policy is crucial to the achievement of sustained
growth without inflation. We shall take a further initiative to secure wider
acceptance and effective implementation of such a policy. In addition, a
downward pressure on prices will be increasingly exerted by Conservative
measures to stimulate industrial competition.

N.E.D.C. and Planning

We have set up the National Economic Development Council, bringing
together Government, management and unions in a co-operative venture to
improve our economic performance. This has been followed by the
establishment of Economic Development Committees for a number of
individual industries.

N.E.DC. gives reality to the democratic concept of planning by partnership.
In contemporary politics the argument is not for or against planning. All
human activity involves planning. The question is: how is the planning to be
done? By consent or by compulsion?

The Labour Party's policy of extended State ownership and centralised
control would be economically disastrous and incompatible with the
opportunities and responsibilities of a free society. Conservatives believe
that a democratic country as mature as ours must be self-disciplined and not
State-controlled, law-abiding without being regulation-ridden, co-operative
but not coerced.

Modernisation and Competition

Record progress is being made in modernising industry. Today capital

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1964/1964-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 21

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

investment in new factories, construction, plant and equipment is twice as
high as when the Socialists left office. Our financial incentives for this
purpose are now the best in the world, and we shall see that tax policies
continue to stimulate industrial innovation.

Britain's total spending on civil scientific research and development has
more than trebled since the mid-1950s. In this effort Government and
industry have shared.

We shall further improve the organisation for promoting civil science by
setting up new research councils. An industrial research and development
authority will be formed to undertake basic and applied work of importance
to industry.

Economic efficiency and increasing leisure have always depended on
supplementing human with mechanical effort, and increasingly
mechanisation must extend to the control systems which link and co-
ordinate the machines. It is an important feature of our policy to encourage
the wider spread of automated equipment. The National Research
Development Corporation, with extended powers and finance, will be helped
to sponsor the application of such new techniques in industry.

Whilst recognising the Government's obligation to assist in these ways, we
are convinced that the rapidly changing world of industrial technology is the
last place for Socialism. It calls for a flexibility, and a response to new ideas
and requirements, which a system of free competitive enterprise is best
suited to provide. The Conservative Party is utterly opposed to any extension
of nationalisation, whether outright or piecemeal. We propose to complete
the denationalisation of steel. Industries in public ownership will continue to
be developed as modern businesses.

Competition and the Consumer

In private industry and trade we intend to stimulate the forces of competition
which make for efficiency and bring down prices. Abolition of resale price
maintenance, save in cases where it can be shown to serve the public
interest, will have this effect on retail trade. In the next Parliament our first
major Bill will be one to strengthen the Monopolies Commission, speed up
its work, and enlarge the Government's powers to implement its
recommendations. It will enable us to deal with any merger or takeover bid
likely to lead to harmful monopoly conditions.

We shall reform the Companies Act, so as to take account of modern
developments and give added protection to investors.

Competition and free choice are the customers' most effective safeguards.
We welcome the many signs of growing consumer awareness and influence,
and have established and will finance the Consumer Council as a spokesman
for these interests. We shall follow up our reform of hire purchase and
weights and measures by improving merchandise marks legislation, and by
strengthening the Sale of Goods Act so as to secure greater protection for

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1964/1964-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 21

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

shoppers in such matters as warranties and guarantees.

The restrictions on shop hours, which are particularly inconvenient for the
growing number of women at work, are being reviewed. Our aim is to
achieve greater flexibility in the present arrangements, while maintaining
necessary safeguards for shop-workers.

Full Employment

We believe that a growing and competitive economy must redeploy its
resources to meet or anticipate changes in markets, methods and machines.
But the interests of those who work in industry must be fully safeguarded in
the process. Otherwise responses to change could act as a brake on
modernisation and rising standards.

Redundancy and Retraining

The Government is helping industry to plan its manpower requirements
ahead so that unnecessary redundancies are avoided. Our new Contracts of
Employment Act gives employees for the first time statutory rights to a
minimum period of notice. We attach great importance to the wider
extension of arrangements whereby redundant workers are compensated by
their employers through severance payments.

In the next Parliament we shall reform the unemployment benefit under the
national insurance scheme. Men and women with earnings above a
minimum level will be able to receive for sonic months a graduated
supplement to their flat-rate benefit. Their total benefit will thus be more
closely related to their normal standard of living, and those unable to find a
new job right away will be protected against a sharp fall in income. Some
workers who fall ill may suffer comparable financial hardship, and a similar
change will be made in sickness benefit. Our detailed scheme will be put
forward when we have completed our discussions with representatives of the
interests concerned.

We are at present carrying through in Government training centres a
doubling of the facilities for retraining men and women in new skills. In
addition, the industrial training boards which are being set up under our new
legislation will stimulate industries particularly those that are expanding to
provide greatly improved systems of apprenticeship, training and retraining.

Regional Development

Our programme of regional development will expand employment
prospects, make the maximum use of national resources and spread
prosperity more evenly throughout the United Kingdom. In this way, the
potentialities of each region can be developed to the utmost and at the same
time its characteristics retained.

This programme combines the provision of better communications, up-to-

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1964/1964-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 21

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

date social services and improved amenities with generous inducements to
build new factories, install modern equipment and provide fresh jobs where
they are most required. Its object is to make each region a more efficient
place to work in and a more attractive place to live in. Our studies for this
purpose now cover Wales, Scotland and most of England.

In central Scotland and north-east England we are already carrying out
programmes without precedent in conception and scale. Their impact is
evident in the renewed activity and growing buoyancy of these areas which
are looking, not towards the problems of the past, but to the technological
developments of the future. Thus the places which pioneered the first
industrial revolution will become full partners in the second.

In south-east England our programme will ensure proper development to
meet the needs of the natural growth of population. New cities and towns
and urban expansions will be built to provide work and homes away from
the capital. Consultations are now being held about the location and size of
these developments, which will be carried out without prejudicing growth
elsewhere. We are determined to check the drift to the south and to achieve a
sound balance over the whole country.

A Conservative Government will continue to control immigration from
overseas according to the numbers which our crowded country and its
industrial regions can absorb. We shall ensure that the working of the
Commonwealth Immigrants Act, which we passed in 1962 against bitter
Labour Party opposition, is fair and effective.

Industrial Relations

All these measures to protect and expand employment should help reduce
industrial disputes. They also highlight the lack of justification in present
conditions for many restrictive practices of labour.

The trade unions have a vital responsibility to diminish such handicaps to
Britain's competitive strength. We shall continue to seek their co-operation
in matters of common interest and to work in partnership with them through
NEDC.

Recent decisions in the courts have thrown into promin2nce aspects of the
law affecting trade unions and employers' associations. The law has not been

reviewed since the beginning of the century, and it will be the subject of an
early inquiry.

Britain on the Move

We shall press ahead with improving and reshaping the transport system to
fit the needs of a modern Britain.

The first essential is to make the best possible provision for the increase in
private motoring which prosperity brings. Since the 1959 election we have

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1964/1964-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 21

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

carried out a £600m. programme of new road building. During the next five
years £1 ~50m will be devoted to this purpose.

On our present plans the first thousand miles of Britain's motorway system
will be completed in 1973. In addition ~ shall improve hundreds of miles of
trunk roads. A modern system of road signs will be installed, and we shall
concentrate on measures to increase safety.

We are putting particular emphasis on reducing traffic congestion in towns.
In the longer term, we shall apply the principles of the Buchanan Report to
comprehensive campaigns of town replanning. As an immediate step,
expenditure on urban roads will be trebled. In London big improvements in
traffic flow have resulted from overall management by the Traffic
Management Unit: we shall arrange with the other major conurbations for
the same methods to be applied by them.

Public Transport

We shall complete the Victoria Underground line, and will encourage the
development and use of new techniques for public transport in the towns. In
six rural areas pilot schemes are being started to provide better bus services
in some cases with financial support from the Government and county
councils. fly mid-1965 we hope to extend' such schemes to other parts of the
countryside.

Under the Beeching Plan we are producing an economic railway system able
to attract suitable traffic off the roads by its own efficiency. A faster and
more reliable rail service is increasingly being provided on the busy main
lines for passengers and freight, and millions of pounds have already been
knocked off the railway losses. We shall not consent to the closure of any
service where this will damage economic development or cause undue
hardship. Alternative bus services, with facilities for luggage. will be
provided where necessary.

Sea and Air

Britain's ports are now entering a new era when great development schemes
will be carried through to the benefit of our trade. We have supported our
shipowners against foreign interference and passed the Shipping Contracts
Act which will protect British interests. We affirm our faith in the future of
the shipbuilding industry whose current prospects have been much improved
by our credits scheme.

We intend to press ahead with negotiations for the Channel Tunnel so that an
early start can be made.

In developing efficient air communications we believe that a combination of

public and private enterprise is best. We shall encourage the growth of a
network of internal air services and airports to meet local needs.

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

Progress on the Land

On our farms productivity has been rising by 5 per cent. a year. Output is
approaching twice what it was before the war. Modernisation is proceeding
apace under the Farm Improvement Scheme and the Small Farmers Scheme.

British agriculture is efficient and competitive, and makes an indispensable
contribution to our economic and social strength.

The Conservative Government has evolved a system of support which has
provided a sound basis for this progress. It is being adapted now to changed
world conditions. Agreements have been reached with our overseas
suppliers to regulate imports of cereals and bacon, and we shall continue to
work for a stable market for meat. These policies are in line with our desire
to conclude world-wide agreements for key commodities. Together with the
improvement we shall bring about in marketing arrangements for home
products, they will assure British farmers of a fair share of a growing
market.

In developing our policies we shall continue to uphold the principles of the
1947 and 1957 Agriculture Acts. With imports regulated and home
production more effectively related to market needs through standard
quantity systems, greater weight can be given to farmers' returns at future
price reviews. The long-term assurances under our 1957 Act will continue
throughout the life of the next Parliament.

Our new deal for horticulture will strengthen the industry's ability to
compete. We offer substantial aid to growers to adopt the most up-to-date
production and marketing methods. Horticultural markets in major cities will
be rebuilt, and the sites better related to modern traffic conditions. This will
help to get the produce to housewives quicker, fresher and cheaper.

Forestry and Fisheries

The Forestry Commission will carry through a long-term programme of
planting. especially in areas where expansion can bring social and
employment benefits. We will continue our help to private woodland owners.

We have extended British fishery limits in accordance with the recently
negotiated convention, and will further promote the technical progress and
prosperity of the fishing industry.

Powers of river authorities to ensure proper conservation of fisheries will be
extended.

With the aid of river authorities and the new Water Resources Board we

shall develop a national policy of water conservation, so ensuring adequate
supplies to meet increasing demand.

Ways and Means

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1964/1964-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 21

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

The programme we propose for the next five years is an ambitious one; but
we know it can be achieved, for it is based on 13 years of solid progress. It
embraces rising investment in the modernisation of Britain, on the lines we
have described, and rising expenditure on the social services.

The money must be found from two sources: the savings of the nation and
the contributions of taxpayer and ratepayer. We have never disguised that the
cost will be heavy. No programme worthy of this country can be cheap. But
it must be kept within bounds, and related to the growth of the national
income. Our proposals are based on our target of a 4 per cent. annual growth
rate, and on maintaining a high level of savings.

One thing is quite certain. The Labour Party's promises would cost many
hundreds of millions more than our programme. At the same time their
policies would discourage enterprise and savings. The result could only be
renewed inflation and rapidly rising taxes.

Incentives to Save

To secure a still higher volume of savings, a Conservative Government will
introduce new incentives. In particular we aim to devise a contractual
savings scheme, giving attractive benefits to those who undertake to save
regularly over a period of years.

We shall also encourage the successful efforts which are being made to
widen the field of share ownership.

Taxpayer and Ratepayer

We shall continue to reform the tax system, both on companies and on
individuals, to make it less complicated and fairer in its incidence.

Local authority services are expanding in response to public need and
demand, but in some instances and areas the cost is outpacing the capacity of
householders to pay. We recognise that a reform of the rates is required. The
precise scale and methods will be determined as soon as our full inquiries,
now in progress, are complete. These inquiries which could not have been
undertaken effectively until revaluation had been carried through-cover the
whole rating system, potential sources of local authority finance, the impact
of rates now, and the current Exchequer grants.

In the light of these studies we shall ensure that the cost of local government,
and particularly of education, is fairly apportioned between ratepayers and
taxpayers, as well as making changes in the system of grants. In carrying out
these and any other necessary reforms, we shall bear specially in mind those
householders living on small fixed incomes.

Opportunity for Youth

Education is the most rapidly developing feature of our social outlay. Its

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1964/1964-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 21

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

share of the expanded national wealth has risen since 1951 from 3 per cent.
to 5 per cent., and will go on rising. This reflects our view of education as at
once a right of the child, a need of society, and a condition of economic
efficiency. It also matches a tremendous upsurge in educational ambition and
attainment.

The Party Manifestos

Our aim is to see that suitable education or training is available to every boy
and girl up to at least 18. These are the steps we shall take:

1. The minimum school-leaving age will be raised to 16 for all who enter
secondary school after the summer of 1967. This, which we looked
forward to in the 1944 Education Act, is not to be just ""another year at
school"". The whole school course will be refashioned to give a wider
and deeper education.

2. More and more who have the ability to benefit will stay on to 17 and
18 and go forward to higher education. This will be made possible by
our plans for the universities, colleges of advanced technology, higher
technical institutions and teacher training colleges. There will be
places for 100,000 extra students by 1968, and for a steadily growing
number after that.

3. For those leaving school to start work at once, we shall further
develop the Youth Employment Service and encourage the
appointment by schools of careers advisers of high calibre, as well as
improving industrial apprenticeship and training. Steps will be taken
to increase the number of industrial workers under 18 who are
released during the day to attend technical and other courses. We shall
continue our great expansion of technical colleges.

Buildings and Teachers

The building of new schools and the modernising of existing ones will be
pressed ahead. The rising school population will put heavy pressure on our
resources, but we are determined to devote a share of each year's programme
to improving conditions in the older primary schools.

The training colleges will be producing by 1970 three times as many new
teachers as in 1958, and the larger numbers going on to higher education will
mean more teachers later on. We shall sustain our successful campaign for

the return of qualified married women to teaching. Improved machinery will
be established for the negotiation of teachers salaries.

Research and Organisation

We shall continue to encourage educational research and provide extra funds
for this purpose.

Of the many different forms of secondary school organisation which now

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1964/1964-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 21

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

exist, none has established itself as exclusively right. The Socialist plan to
impose the comprehensive principle, regardless of the wishes of parents,
teachers and authorities, is therefore foolishly doctrinaire. Their leader may
protest that grammar schools will be abolished ' over his dead body"", but
abolition would be the inevitable and disastrous consequence of the policy to
which they are committed. Conservative policy, by contrast, is to encourage
provision, in good schools of every description, of opportunities for all
children to go forward to the limit of their capacity.

The Youth Service

Beyond the gates of school, college and factory, young people need ample
facilities for social activity and outlets for adventure and service.

As we promised in 1959, the Youth Service has been rejuvenated through the
building of new clubs and the training of capable leaders. We shall press
forward with this work, encourage more courses of the 'Outward Bound""
type, and foster schemes whereby young people can assist the elderly.

Re-Shaping Social Security

Under Conservatism the value of social security benefits has outpaced both
prices and average earnings; under Socialism they were eaten away by
inflation. We pledge ourselves to ensure that those receiving such benefits
continue to share in the higher standards produced by an expanding
economy.

Help will be concentrated first and foremost on those whose needs are
greatest. Special insurance provision has already been directed to widows
with children. When next we make a general increase in benefits, we shall
give preferential treatment to the older pensioners.

Those who work after retirement age, and widows at work, have benefited
from a steady relaxation of the earnings rule "". In the next Parliament we
shall again progressively raise the amounts they can earn without deduction
of pension.

Our graduated pension scheme, started in 1961, embodied the principle that
retirement pensions should be more closely related to individual earnings.
As we have explained, we are now proposing to extend this principle to
benefits for the early months of unemployment and sickness, and we shall
give similar help to widows during the early months of widowhood.

General Review

All these proposals will make important improvements in the existing social
security system. This system was framed 20 years ago, and in the light of
pre-war experience. Since then there have been dramatic changes in
economic conditions and social needs. We therefore propose to institute a
full review of social security arrangements, so that their subsequent

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1964/1964-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 14 of 21

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

development may be suited to modern circumstances.

The review will not be confined to the national insurance scheme, but will
include industrial injuries insurance, the varying provisions for widows, and
the method of supplementing benefits.

Pension Rights

In organising social security the State ought not to stifle personal and family
responsibility or the growth of sound occupational schemes. Socialist plans
would do precisely that. We Conservatives welcome the valuable additional
security which occupational schemes provide, and will help to preserve such
pension rights for people changing jobs.

We shall continue to make special provision for war widows and those
disabled in the service of their country. The level of pensions for retired
members of the armed forces and other Government servants will be
adjusted as necessary. In the next Pensions Increase Act we shall reduce the
age at which such pension increases are payable from 60 to 55.

The Housing Programme

One family in every four is living in a new home built under the
Conservatives. More than half of the million houses classified as unfit when
our slum clearance drive began have been replaced. One third of the
2,500,000 older houses capable of improvement have been given a new lease
of life with the aid of Government grant.

This is a vast achievement; but there is much more to do. We are again
speeding up progress on every front. Here are the main points of our
programme:

1. Expansion in House-building

Since 1951 homes have been built at an average rate of 300,000 a year. We
shall build about 370,000 this year. Next year we shall reach our new target
of 400,000. This will be sustained, and will enable us to overtake remaining
shortages, while keeping pace with the needs of a more prosperous, younger
marrying, longer living and fast increasing population.

2. Slum Clearance and Urban Renewal

In the towns and cities where most remaining slums are concentrated,
clearance rates are being doubled. We aim to clear by 1973 virtually all the
known slums. As each authority completes this task, we shall go on to
redevelop out-dated residential areas.

3. Modernising Older Houses

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1964/1964-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 15 of 21

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

Already 130,000 sound older houses are being modernised each year. The
1964 Housing Act provides for systematic improvement in older areas, with
powers of compulsion where landlords are not persuaded to co-operate by
the better grant arrangements. In this way we shall step up modernisation to
200,000 a year.

4. Increasing Home Ownership

Owner-occupation has spread to 44 per cent. of families. Conservatives will
encourage its continued increase. Land registration leads to reduction of
legal fees involved in house purchase: we shall hasten this process, aiming to
complete it first in built-up areas and then for the whole country.

5. Co-ownership and Cost Renting

Co-ownership schemes provide most of the advantages of owner-occupation
for a much smaller deposit and lower out-goings. We have set up a Housing
Corporation which will release £300m. to housing societies, building for co-
ownership and for renting without subsidy and without profit.

6. Local Authority Housing

We intend to revise the system of housing subsidies. Provided authorities
charge proper rents, with rebates for those who cannot afford them, they will
be able to plan ahead confidently and maintain necessary programmes
especially for slum clearance, relief of overcrowding new and expanded
towns, and the needs of the elderly - without burdening the rates.

7. Improved Building Methods

Our long-term plans give the construction industries confidence to expand
and modernise. Through the voluntary consortia of local authorities and our
National Building Agency they are enabled to introduce up-to-date methods
and techniques which save site labour and increase productivity. We shall
reform the laws governing building standards and safeguard the quality of
houses for owner-occupation.

8. Supply of Land

Our regional studies, showing land needs for twenty years ahead, will enable
planning authorities to release ample land in the right places and without
damage to the green belts. This substantial increase in the supply of land will
do more to stabilise land prices than anything else.

Where major developments are in prospect-such as the many new towns and
town expansions which are being started or proposed land will be acquired
well in advance and made available to private and public enterprise as
necessary.

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

The Finance Act 1962 brought short-term land transactions within the sphere
of ordinary taxation. In considering any further measure to tax land
transactions, the test must be that it should not adversely affect the price or
the supply of land.

We reject the Labour Party's"" Land Commission"" as an unworkable and
bureaucratic device, which would dry up the voluntary supply of land and
slow down all our housing and building programmes.

9, Rent Control

In the next Parliament we shall take no further steps to remove rent control.
Additional safeguards for tenants will be provided if shown to be necessary
by the inquiry into rented housing in London.

A Healthy Nation

The past thirteen years have seen improvements in the nation's health greater
than in any comparable period. These advances we owe to medical science
and the skill of the healing professions. They could only have been achieved
against a background of rising living standards and continuously expanding
health services such as Conservative Government is providing.

The Conservative Hospital Plan will ensure that every man, woman and
child in the country has access to the best treatment. We aim to build or
rebuild some 300 hospitals of which over 80 are already in progress-and
carry through 400 major schemes of improvement. Priority will be given to
additional maternity beds, so that every mother who needs to will be able to
have her baby in hospital. There will be no question of closing any existing
hospital unless or until there is satisfactory alternative provision.

Those not needing hospital care will be properly looked after by community
services. Local authorities are expanding these under our health and welfare
plan. Support for old people living at home will come from increasing
numbers of health visitors, home nurses, home helps and social workers for
those who can no longer manage on their own, there will be modern,
specially designed accommodation. Provision for the physically and
mentally handicapped is being brought up to date and will be greatly
increased. New maternity and child welfare clinics are being built
throughout the country.

In these plans for the nation's health, the scope for voluntary service will be

emphasised, and we shall concentrate on the human approach which can
make all the difference when a person is sick, handicapped or lonely.

Cure and Prevention

A working party is now considering how best we can help the crucial work
of the family doctor. Terms and conditions of service, methods of payment,

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1964/1964-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 21

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

the number of patients on doctors lists, and their access to hospitals and
other facilities will be reviewed, so as to raise still further the standards of
good doctoring.

We shall improve and bring up to date the law controlling the safety and
quality of drugs.

We shall also continue our campaigns against the enemies of good health, by
eliminating slum environments, reducing air pollution, and cleaning the
rivers and beaches.

The Quality of Life

There is an enormous growth in the variety and richness of leisure-time
activity. Appreciation of the arts, hobbies and handicrafts of every kind,
physical sports, home and foreign travel-these and other pursuits are
increasing year by year. They are a cheerful measure of rising prosperity. For
the ""affluence"" at which Socialists sneer is enabling people, not only to
satisfy material wants, but to develop their interests and their feel for the
quality of life.

The Government has trebled since 1951 the amount of money provided for
the arts. Recently we have helped to bring the National Theatre into being,
multiplied several times over the grants to museums and galleries for
purchasing works of art, and done much to preserve and open to the public
old and lovely houses. We shall continue to expand this support and to
increase the resources of the Arts Council We shall also seek to promote
higher standards of architecture and civic planning, and commission works
by contemporary artists for public buildings.

Broadcasting and Television

Broadcasting in Britain has always been regarded as a medium for providing
information, education and entertainment. For all these elements to find
effective expression, viewers and listeners must be given the widest possible
choice of programmes. This is why we introduced I.T.V., authorised BBC-2,
and have licensed experiments in Pay-as-you-view television by wire.

We wish to extend the range of choice still further. That will be our object
when considering proposals for the fourth television channel and for the
establishment of a system of local sound radio.

Sport

Capital outlay for sport and physical recreation has increased fourfold in
four years. But there remains a need in and around the towns and cities for
many more sports grounds, playing fields, running tracks, swimming baths
and gymnasia. Local authorities have been advised on how to combine with
their neighbours for the larger projects, and a substantial programme will be
authorised.

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

Countryside Commission

In the countryside we must satisfy the need for recreational facilities without
harm to rural and farming interests.

We propose to set up a countryside commission with sufficient resources to
secure the positive care of countryside and coast, including the national
parks. It will be charged with promoting the systematic clearance in these
localities of derelict land and other eyesores. Whilst strictly safeguarding
secluded areas, the commission will advise planning authorities on the
designation of recreation areas"" where boating, climbing, gliding and similar
activities will be welcome.

Freedom and Order

The consistent aim of Conservative policy is to uphold the British way of
life, centred upon the dignity and liberty of the individual.

To this end we swept away Socialist restrictions and restored freedom of
enterprise and choice. We safeguarded individual rights at tribunals and
inquiries along the lines suggested by the Franks Report. We have made
reforms in the composition of the House of Lords, the procedure of the
House of Commons, and the structure of local government. We have taken
measures to protect the public against lawlessness and introduced
compensation for the victims of violent crime.

We intend to continue this work of modernising our institutions and
strengthening the rule of law.

We shall propose to the newly elected House of Commons the immediate
establishment of a select committee to consider further reforms in
parliamentary procedure. It will be asked as matters of priority to review the
methods for scrutinising public expenditure and to consider ways of
speeding up the passage of many technical and relatively uncontroversial
law reform Bills which we intend to bring forward. It will also have the
opportunity to consider whether adequate means are available to members of
Parliament to secure the redress of genuine complaints of maladministration.

A Conservative Government will call an all-party conference presided over
by the Speaker to review electoral law. Among the changes it should
consider is an extension of postal voting, since two-thirds of the nation now
take holidays away from home.

In completing the reorganisation of local government, we shall aim to
produce a system giving full scope to local knowledge, and capable of
discharging within our regional plans the increasing responsibilities
inseparable from rising population, living standards and car ownership.

We have appointed a committee to advise us on the best methods to
stimulate and finance social studies both basic and applied, and we shall take

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1964/1964-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 19 of 21

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40
action as soon as it reports.
Upholding Law

We shall continue to build up the strength of the police forces, and see that
they are equipped with every modern scientific aid. A royal commission has
been set up to report on sentencing policies and the most effective methods
for the treatment of offenders. We have asked it to give urgent priority to the
growing problem of crime among the young. Meanwhile, we have increased
the penalties for malicious damage and the compensation to those who suffer
from this form of hooliganism.

The system of after-care will be developed on comprehensive lines, to save
offenders from returning to crime.

Much juvenile delinquency originates in broken or unhappy homes. We shall
continue to support the work of marriage guidance. Local authorities will be

encouraged, in co-operation with voluntary bodies, to develop their services

of child care for young people deprived of normal home life and affection.

We shall extend legal aid to all care and protection cases in juvenile courts
and, as resources permit, to tribunal cases beginning with the Lands
Tribunal.

TheNation's Choice

We are issuing, simultaneously with this manifesto, special statements
recording our achievements and plans in Scotland and in Wales. These
demonstrate our regard for the distinctive rights and problems of each
nation. They also show how our programmes are designed to secure the even
spread of prosperity throughout Great Britain.

A Conservative and Unionist Government will continue to support the
Government of Northern Ireland in developing and diversifying the
economy, and so providing new employment. It is a cardinal principle of our
policy that Northern Ireland's partnership with Great Britain in the United
Kingdom shall remain unchanged so long as that is the wish of the
Parliament at Stormont.

We have now shown the extent to which, by building upon past progress,
fresh advances can be made with a Conservative Government in the next
five years.

But we warn the nation that both the gains of the past and the hopes of the
future would be imperilled by Socialism.

On examination, what the Labour Parry have to offer is not a ""New Britain"",

but a camouflaged return to the dreary doctrines which had already proved a
failure when they were last dismissed from office.

1964 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:40

What we are offering is an extension of that prosperity - prosperity with a
purpose - which our policies have been proved to achieve.

1959 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

The Next Five Years

Foreword

As Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party I submit this Manifesto to
the judgment of my fellow countrymen and women.

This constructive programme-indeed its very title-will show you that we do
not intend to rest in the next five years upon the achievements of the past.
We must both de fend and develop the great gains that we have made. Our
policy can be simply stated:

Prosperity and Peace.

I do not remember any period in my lifetime when the economy has been so
sound and the prosperity of our people at home so widely spread; but we
must also do what we can to extend a generous helping hand to the
Commonwealth family and others overseas.

As for peace, it is of course the supreme purpose of all policy. I have lived
through two wars and all my efforts are directed to prevent a third. Events of
the last few months give me hope that we may be moving into a more
constructive period. Vital international negotiations lie ahead and I ask you
to continue to entrust them to a Conservative Government.

Harold Macmillan

The Conservative Record

Eight years ago was a turning point in British history. The Labour
Government had failed in grappling with the problems of the post-war
world. Under Conservative leadership this country set out upon a new path.
It is leading to prosperity and opportunity for all.

The British economy is sounder today than at any time since the first world
war. Sterling has been reestablished as a strong and respected currency.
Under Conservative government we have earned abroad £1,600 million
more than we have spent. Our exports have reached the highest peak ever.
Overseas, mostly in the Commonwealth, we are investing nearly double

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1959/1959-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 13

1959 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

what we could manage eight years ago. Capital investment at home, to build
for the future, is over half as large again. To match this, and make it possible,
people are saving more than ever before.

The paraphernalia of controls have been swept away. The call-up is being
abolished. We have cut taxes in seven Budgets, whilst continuing to develop
the social services. We have provided over two million new homes and
almost two million new school places, a better health service and a modern
pensions plan. We have now stabilised the cost of living while maintaining
full employment. We have shown that Conservative freedom works. Life is
better with the Conservatives.

In the international field, thanks to the initiative of the Conservative
Government, the diplomatic deadlock between East and West has now been
broken. The Prime Minister's visit to Russia in February began a sequence of
events which has led to the present easing of tension. The proposed
exchange of visits between President Eisenhower and Mr. Khrushchev is the
most recent proof of this. It is our determination to see that this process
continues and to make a success of the important negotiations which we
trust will follow.

The main issues at this election are therefore simple: (1) Do you want to go
ahead on the lines which have brought prosperity at home? (2} Do you want
your present leaders to represent you abroad?

Sharing Prosperity

Conservative policy is to double the British standard of living in this
generation and ensure that all sections of society share in the expansion of
wealth.

While we have been in charge of the nation's affairs, many more of the good
things of life have been enjoyed by families large and small, and so long as
we remain in charge they will be able to fulfil many more of their hopes and
ambitions. But this is not enough. Conservatism is more than successful
administration. It is a way of life. It stands for integrity as well as for
efficiency, for moral values as well as for material advancement, for service
and not merely self-seeking. We believe that in this spirit and as a
contribution to world peace, we British must make a big and sustained effort
to help others, particularly within the Commonwealth, climb nearer to our
own high level of prosperity.

By raising living standards and by social reform we are succeeding in
creating One Nation at home. We must now carry this policy into the wider
world where the gap between the industrialised and the underdeveloped
nations is still so great. This can be done by individual service, by increased
trade and by investment, public and private.

Under Conservatism annual investment overseas has been more than one per
cent of the national income. We want to do better than this, but to do better

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1959/1959-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 13

1959 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

require.’ more than a warm heart; we must earn a bigger surplus on our trade
overseas.

So at the very forefront of our programme for the next five years we place
these three essential conditions of success-a strong pound, expanding trade
and national unity.

1. The Pound

Sterling is the currency in which nearly half the world's trade is done. Our
paramount aim will be to maintain international confidence in it as a sound
and stable medium of exchange.

We shall use flexible monetary and other measures to achieve the right
balance in the home economy, to keep the cost of living as steady as possible
in the interests of the house wife, and to ensure that our goods and services
are available at prices the world will pay.

2. Trade Opportunities

We shall concentrate on the further promotion of the export trade.

Half our trade is with the Commonwealth, and the new Commonwealth
Economic Consultative Council will provide further opportunities for
expansion. We shall continue to take steps to increase the flow of trade with
America in which for the first time in a century our exports have exceeded
our imports. We are about to join an economic association of Seven
European countries; our aim remains an industrial free market embracing all
Western Europe. The recent trade agreement we made with Soviet Russia is
already leading to more orders for British machinery and other goods.

3. Unity

Prosperity depends on the combined efforts of the nation as a whole. None
of us can afford outmoded approaches to the problems of today, and we
intend to invite the representatives of employers and trades unions to
consider afresh with us the human and industrial problems that the next five
years will bring.

Employment and Economic Change

So long as Conservative policies of sound currency and expanding trade are
continued, and unity at home maintained, full employment is safe. But
patches of local unemployment can be created by swift changes in markets,
methods and machines. Our policy is to welcome technical progress, which
can lead to dramatic increases in prosperity and leisure, but at the same time
to deal with the problems it brings.

Our first major Bill in the next Parliament will be one to remodel and

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1959/1959-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 13

1959 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

strengthen our powers for coping with local unemployment. This will be
done in three ways-by ensuring that we can act anywhere in Britain where
high local unemployment shows up; by adding to the places where we can
now offer help, those where there is a clear and imminent threat of
unemployment; and by offering capital grants to encourage the building of
new factories where they are most needed, as an addition to subsidising the
rent of Government-built factories. This policy will also feature the clearing
of sites to make a district attractive to new industry.

These measures will be of particular help to Scotland and Wales. We shall
continue to help the Government of Northern Ireland to deal with the special
problem there.

Many individual industries have to adjust themselves to new conditions. The
Government will play its part in assisting the aircraft industry to increase its
sales, and will help in fostering research and development. Shipping and
shipbuilding depend on expanding world trade which our policies are
directed to encourage. We shall do all we can to assist them in their
problems, and also intend to support the replacement of the Queen liners.

Reorganisation and re-equipment of the Lancashire cotton industry has got
away to a good start. With the help of the Act we have passed it can have a
prosperous future. It is a condition of grants under this Act that
compensation is paid to displaced operatives.

As part of our policy of easing general mobility of labour, measures will be
taken to encourage re-training. Part of the capacity of the Government
Training Centres will be used to make a direct contribution towards the
provision of adequate opportunities for apprenticeship. We shall also
continue our support of the Industrial Training Council which we took the
initiative in setting up.

Many educational, industrial and official bodies have made provision since

the war for management courses. We should welcome the creation of an
Advanced Business School at one of the universities.

Policy For Progress

We are determined to keep Britain a great and go-ahead country, leading the
world in important branches of technology, and translating its technological
advance into productive capacity with a high and rising rate of investment.

This is how we shall set about this task in the next five years.

1. Technical Advance

One Cabinet Minister will be given the task of promoting scientific and
technological development. Whilst it would be wrong to concentrate all

Government scientific work into a single Ministry, this Minister for Science
will have responsibility for the Department of Scientific and Industrial

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1959/1959-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 13

1959 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

Research, the Medical and Agricultural Research Councils and the Nature
Conservancy, the atomic energy programme, and the United Kingdom
contribution to space research.

The development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes will be pressed
ahead. A conference will be called of those concerned in industry and
education to forward the spread and understanding of automation. We shall
encourage new inventions and the development of new techniques.

Under the railway programme over 3,000 new diesels will be delivered into
service by 1965, 8,000 miles of track re-laid, and electric traction increased
by 60 per cent. We shall go ahead with a ‘round-the-world! telephone cable
in co-operation with the Commonwealth, and maintain our lead in
telecommunications by building a new large cable-laying ship.

2. Modern Roads

The rising volume of traffic, a yardstick of rising prosperity, must be
matched by an intensive drive to build better and safer roads. Our road
programme is already the biggest we have ever had in this country. Over the
next five years it will be twice as big as over the last five years.

Our first priority in England and Wales will be to complete the five major
schemes and motorways, which with their urban links and through routes
will provide the framework of a new road system. In Scotland we mean to
complete the Forth Road Bridge, the two Clyde Tunnels and the
reconstruction of the Carlisle-Glasgow-Stirling trunk road, and to speed up
the programme of Highland road development.

At the same time there will be a country-wide drive to improve the existing
road net work and new schemes to relieve congestion in the towns. Severn
and Tay Bridges will both be started.

3. The Land

Farming in Britain today is efficient and prosperous. Great progress has been
made possible by our system of long-term price guarantees and the payment
of grants for modern buildings, equipment and techniques. This policy will
be developed so as to ensure stability to farmer and farm worker.

We give a pledge that the long-term assurances to agriculture contained in
our 1957 Act will continue for the life-time of the next Parliament. In the
light of experience, we shall consider, in close consultation with the leaders
of the industry, any improvements and developments in agricultural policy
including the small farmers scheme.

We shall continue to promote the well-being of the British fishing industry.

We confirm that horticulture must have support comparable with that given
to agriculture generally. We shall continue to use the tariff as the main
instrument of protection. Legislation will be passed to provide improvement

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1959/1959-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 13

1959 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

grants of £71/2 million and to help reform horticultural marketing, including
a streamlining of the operation of the central London markets.

In the next five years, 300,000 acres will be planted by the Forestry
Commission. Encouragement will continue to be given to private woodland
owners. We attach importance to the prosperity of this industry, which would
be further assured by the establishment of an effective marketing
organisation.

There will be continued improvement in amenities for families who live on
the land a further extension of water, sewerage and electricity supplies, and
better housing and schools. We have set up a Committee to help us solve the
problem of public transport in the country side.

4. Nationalised Industries

We are utterly opposed to any extension of nationalisation, by whatever
means. We shall do everything possible to ensure improved commercial
standards of operation and less centralisation in those industries already
nationalised. In addition, we shall review the situation in civil aviation, and
set up a new licensing authority to bring a greater measure of freedom to
nationally and privately owned airlines.

To further the development of the Post Office as a modern business, we
propose to separate its current finances from the Exchequer. Direct
Ministerial responsibility to Parliament and the status of Post Office
employees as Civil Servants will be retained.

5. Public Administration

In addition to our proposals regarding the Minister for Science, we shall
from time to time make such changes in the functions of Ministers as are
necessary to suit modern needs.

We shall maintain our policy of giving special regard to the distinctive rights
and problems of Scotland and Wales. Transfer of administrative work from
London will be carried further as opportunity allows.

We look forward to reforming and strengthening the structure of local
democracy, in the light of reports from the Local Government Commissions
for England and Wales.

The whole administrative system of town and country planning will be

reviewed afresh with the aim of simplifying procedure, achieving
improvements and reducing delays.

Opportunity and Security

Conservatives want everybody to have a fuller opportunity to earn more and
to own more - and to create a better life for themselves and their children.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1959/1959-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 13

1959 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

We shall proceed in the next Parliament with our policy of reducing
whenever possible the burden of taxation.

We shall encourage facilities for the small investor to have a stake in British
industry.

1. Education

During the next five years we shall concentrate on producing a massive
enlargement of educational opportunity at every level. The necessary work is
already in hand. Four programmes, each the biggest of its kind ever
undertaken in Britain, are gathering momentum.

Training colleges for teachers, which will now provide a three-year course,
are being expanded by nearly two-thirds so as to get rid of over-large
classes; the number of students at universities is to be further increased by at
least one-third; new technical college buildings are opening at the rate of one
a week; and we shall spend some £400 million by 1965 to improve the
quality of our school buildings.

We shall defend the grammar schools against doctrinaire Socialist attack,
and see that they are further developed. We shall bring the modern schools
up to the same high standard. Then the choice of schooling for children can
be more flexible and less worrying for parents. This is the right way to deal
with the problem of the 'eleven-plus'. Already, up and down the country,
hundreds of new modern schools are showing the shape of things to come.
Our programme will open up the opportunities that they provide for further
education and better careers to every boy and girl; and by 1965 we expect
that at least 40 per cent will be staying on after fifteen.

We have appointed a Committee to review the system of awards to students
from public funds, including the present 'means test', and improvements will
be made when it has reported.

2. Good Housing

Our housing policy, so successful in the past, will be pressed ahead with
vigour in the future so as to deal with up-to-date priorities These are the
clearance of the slums, the relief of overcrowding, and the needs of the old.
By 1965 we intend to re-house at least another million people from the
slums.

The local authorities will continue to play a big part along with private
enterprise in meeting housing needs; but we reject as costly and bureaucratic
nonsense the Socialist plan to take into council ownership millions of
privately rented houses.

In the next Parliament we shall take no further action to decontrol rents.

More houses must be built and recent rent legislation given time to have its
full beneficial effect in increasing house-room.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1959/1959-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 13

1959 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

In the last eight years, 750,000 families have bought their own new homes,
and we want to see the process go on. Also, up to £100 million will be
advanced by the Government to building societies for loans on older houses-
and we shall consider increasing this figure if need be.

3. Good Health

As part of a major policy to promote good health, we shall not only clear the
slums, but also wage war on smog by effective use of the Clean Air Act, and
tackle the pollution of rivers and estuaries. We shall offer vaccination against
polio to everyone up to the age of forty and to all specially vulnerable
groups. Prevention of accidents on roads and in the home will be subjects of
sustained campaigns.

On the curative side there will be a big programme of hospital building. We
already have sixteen new general or mental hospitals and some fifty major
extension schemes under way; over the next five years our target is to double
the present capital programme.

The level of doctors' and dentists! pay in the health services will be
considered as soon as the Royal Commission has reported. We shall also be
ready to consider with representatives of the professions their status in the
health services.

Local authorities will be encouraged to develop their health and welfare
services. We shall set up a National Council for Social Work Training to help
recruit and train the extra social workers who will be needed.

4. Security and Retirement

The rates of retirement pensions, which we have increased three times, have
now areal buying power over ten shillings higher than in 1951. We pledge
ourselves to ensure that pensioners continue to share in the good things
which a steadily expanding economy will bring.

Our new pensions scheme will put national insurance on a sound financial
footing, concentrate Exchequer help on those with the lowest earnings, and

enable men and women with higher earnings to make increased provision for

old age. At the same time, we are encouraging the growth of sound
occupational pension schemes.

The weekly amount that can be earned without deduction of pension, by
those who have retired or by widowed mothers, will be further increased.

We shall continue the preferential treatment which our recent legislation has
provided for widows and their children.

Those disabled in the service of their country will remain the subject of our

special care. Particular attention will be given to providing more suitable
vehicles for the badly disabled.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1959/1959-conservative-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 12:41

Page 8 of 13

1959 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

We shall continue to ensure that those dependent on national assistance have
a share in the country's increasing prosperity.

Not only will our housing programme cater more and more for the needs of
the old, but we shall also try to make it easier for them to go on living at
home. For example, better provision will be made for a 'meals on wheels
service for the old and infirm. The extension of the home help service and
the provision of holiday rest homes will be encouraged.

5. The use of Leisure

Two out of three families in the country now own TV, one in three has a car
or motor-cycle, twice as many are taking holidays away from home-these are
welcome signs of the increasing enjoyment of leisure. They are the fruits of
our policies.

But at the same time all this represents a challenge to make the growth of
leisure more purposeful and creative, especially for young people.

Our policy of opportunity will therefore be extended. In particular, we
propose to reorganise and expand the Youth Service. Measures will be taken
to encourage Youth Leadership and the provision of attractive youth clubs,
more playing fields and better facilities for sport. We shall do more to
support the arts including the living theatre. Improvements will be made in
museums and galleries and in the public library service. Particular attention
will be given to the needs of provincial centres.

6. Liberty Under the Law

We believe that it is by emphasis on the home, enlargement of educational
opportunity, development of services for youth and a spread of the
responsibilities of property that national character can be strengthened and
moral standards upheld. In addition, we shall revise some of our social laws,
for example those relating to betting and gaming and to clubs and licensing,
which are at present full of anomalies and lead to abuse and even corruption.

It will continue to be our policy to protect the citizens, irrespective of creed
or colour, against lawlessness.

We intend to review the system of criminal justice and to undertake penal
reforms which will lead offenders to abandon a life of crime. A scheme for
compensating the victims of violent crime for personal injuries will be
considered.

The Legal Aid and Advice Acts will be extended to remaining courts and to
certain tribunals, and the present income and capital limits will be reviewed
to ensure that help is not denied to anyone who needs it.

We shall appoint a Committee to review the working of the Companies Act
in the light of present conditions. Action will be taken to protect the public
against the sale of sub-standard goods and to amend the law on weights and

measures.

We mean to make quite sure that the Press have proper facilities for
reporting the proceedings of local authorities.

In all these matters we shall act to strengthen Britain's traditional way of life,
centred upon the dignity and liberty of the individual.

Our Duty Overseas

Whilst one hundred million people in Europe alone have, since the war, been
forcibly absorbed into the Communist bloc and system, six times that
number have been helped to nationhood within the British Commonwealth.
It is our duty to ourselves and to the cause of freedom everywhere to see that
the facts are known, and that misrepresentation about British 'colonialism'
does not go unchallenged. Progressive expansion of overseas information
services will remain our policy.

The Conservative Government will continue to work out in the
Commonwealth the pattern of a community of free and sovereign nations.
Next year Nigeria, and before long the West Indies, will acquire
independence.

We shall discuss with our partners in the Commonwealth plans to deal with
the status of members too small to be fully self-supporting and self-
governing.

An advisory Commission, under Lord Monckton's chairmanship, is being set
up in preparation for the review of the Constitution of the Federation of
Rhodesia and Nyasaland which is to take place in 1960. Our central aim in
multi-racial countries is to build communities which protect minority rights
and are free of all discrimination on grounds of race or colour. If democracy
is to be secured, education must underpin the franchise; and the rapid
expansion of education is the Commonwealth's most pressing need. We
therefore undertake to increase training facilities for teachers and to make
more English books available; and we will play a leading part in financing
the new Commonwealth scheme of exchange scholar ships and fellowships.

We emphasise the part that individual service can play. The need for
teachers, doctors and technicians of every kind is almost unlimited, and an
appeal to the adventurous spirit of youth must be made. We shall encourage
the professions and industry to help those willing to do so to serve for a few
years in the overseas Commonwealth without prejudice to their careers at
home.

Further British capital will be made available through loans and grants for
sound Commonwealth development. The Colombo Plan and other schemes
of technical co operation will be assisted to the full. We shall back the
proposal for a new International Development Association. The
Conservative Government will continue to support the United Nations'

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1959/1959-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 13

agencies in relieving poverty and combating disease, and will substantially
increase the British contribution to the United Nations! Special Fund for
economic development.

Policy For Peace

The next few years and even months will be critical and perhaps decisive.
As a result of our policies the great powers of the world have closer contacts
both personal and official than for a long time. Provided we use flexibility of
method without abandoning firmness of principle, a great opportunity lies
before us. Peace with justice is our aim.

1. United Nations

Peace cannot finally be secure until there is a world instrument with the
power and the will to deal with aggression and ensure that international
agreements are carried out. In view of the deep divisions between East and
West, this is necessarily a long-term aim. We shall continue trying to build
up the United Nations' strength and influence, but recognise that progress in
improving East-West relations is an essential preliminary. Meanwhile, we
shall give all our support to the work of conciliation and mediation which
the United Nations machinery is well fitted to carry out.

2. Relations with Russia

We are opposed to the Communist system as being wholly contrary to the
basic principles of our freedom and religious faith. We believe that if peace
can be preserved these principles will not only survive in our own part of the
world but spread. Owing to the destructiveness of modern warfare both sides
have in common a greater interest in peace than ever before. If humanity is
to survive both must therefore learn to live together. With this aim we have
worked for a steady improvement in our relations with the Soviet Union.
The steps we have taken to expand trade, promote personal contacts and
discussions and improve means of communication will be pursued.

3. Our Alliances

Meanwhile it remains vitally important to maintain our defensive alliances
throughout the world. In Europe while we will work for the inspection and
reduction of armaments in areas to be agreed, we are opposed to plans which
would alter the military balance and so weaken N.A.T.O.

We have sought to keep the alliance united on matters of principle and
flexible in its diplomacy. For example, over Berlin we are resolved that the
two and a quarter million West Berliners shall preserve their freedom to
choose their way of life. Subject to that, we are ready to work Out new
arrangements to improve the existing situation.

4. The Armed Forces

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1959/1959-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 13

1959 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

Our armed forces are being reorganised on a voluntary basis and extensively
re-equipped to suit them to the needs of the present day. The pay and living
conditions of the Services have been vastly improved and we intend to keep
them in line with standards in civilian life.

5. Disarmament

The power of modern weapons is appalling; but the fact that a nuclear war
would mean mutual destruction is the most powerful deterrent against war. It
is, however, war itself, not a particular weapon, which is the true enemy. Our
aim, therefore, is to move forward by balanced stages towards the abolition
of all nuclear weapons and the reduction of the other weapons and armed
forces to a level which will rule out the possibility of an aggressive war. In
doing this we must stick to the principle that disarmament can be effective
only if it is subject to a proper system of international inspection and control.
To. this end, we have just reached agreement with the Soviet Union on a new
body to consider disarmament and report to the United Nations. We shall
place before it our comprehensive proposals.

6. Nuclear Tests

On British initiative the Conference of experts met last year and reached
agreement on some aspects of controlling the suspension of nuclear tests.
This was followed by the present Geneva Conference and no nuclear
weapon tests have taken place since the Russian tests in November 1958. At
the Conference, effective systems have been worked out for supervising a
ban on nuclear tests in the air and under water, though more work is still to
be done on supervising a ban on tests underground.

We have three objectives, achievement of each of which would be a great
prize:

(i) The end of atmospheric tests and all that that implies. Since agreement in
principle has been reached about the feasibility of controlling a ban on
atmospheric tests, we see no reason why any such tests need ever be
undertaken again by the nuclear powers. It was in this hope that we
suspended our tests.

(ii) The establishment of the first experiment in a system of international
control, which may lead to effective measures of disarmament, both nuclear
and conventional.

(iii) The abolition under effective control of tests of all kinds.

This is a realistic and constructive approach. It maintains British influence in

world affairs unimpaired and paves the way for wider agreements in the
future.

The Alternative

1959 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

Vital issues of defence and foreign policy divide the Socialists in Opposition
and would continue to divide them if returned to power.

Remember their record at home! What have they to offer today that was not
tried and found wanting when they last held office?

The country is disillusioned with nationalisation; but a Labour Government
would extend it. People are glad to be free of controls; but a Labour
Government would clamp them on again. Everyone welcomes stable prices
and lower taxes; but a return to Socialism is bound to mean a return to
inflation and higher taxes. Britain lives by her trade; but Socialism would
disrupt business at home and undermine confidence abroad.

The Socialists have learnt nothing in their period of Opposition save new
ways to gloss over their true intentions. Their policies are old-fashioned and

have no relevance to the problems of the modern world.

Our policies look to the future and offer the best hope of prosperity and
peace with justice.

1955 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

United for Peace and Progress: The
Conservative and Unionist Party's Policy

A Personal Statement by the Prime Minister

I took the decision to recommend a dissolution of Parliament and the
holding of a General Election after much thought, and for reasons which
seem to me of supreme national importance.

One of the greatest figures ever to he Prime Minister of Britain has put aside
his burden. I have been called upon to take his place and to lead the
Conservative and Unionist Party. It will be my purpose to give effect, in
terms of the modem world, to the faith we hold and the principles we
defend.

In the year 1955 - in this age of peril and promise - what needs to be done
can be carried through only with the trust and goodwill of the people of this
country.

This Parliament is already in its fourth year, and it is inevitable that, with a
change of Prime Minister, there should be expectation of a General Election.
I believe that it is better to face this issue now. Uncertainty at home and
abroad as to the political future must he bad for our influence in world affairs
and bad for our trade.

Moreover, as is made clear in the pages which follow, we have far-reaching
plans for the future of our country. They will take years rather than months
to realise, and I need the support of the country to make them possible.

As you know, much of my political life has been concerned with foreign
affairs. Twice in a lifetime my generation has seen its world shaken, and
almost destroyed, by a world war. Our civilisation could not hope to survive
a third. It has been my work to do all I can to prevent such a catastrophe, and
this will remain my firm resolve for the whole time I serve you.

But to secure peace we have to do more than lust want it or just hope for it
We must be firm and resolute. Weakness can lead only to war or to
subjugation without a struggle. Because of this we and our allies have to be
militarily strong. We have to accept the burden this entails. However costly,
it is a price worth paying to avoid a war. We must make it certain that any

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

would-be breaker of the peace knows beyond all doubt that aggression will
be met, and that at once, by overwhelming retribution. If it is known that we
have both the power and the will to deliver such retribution, we can hope
that the danger of war will recede and that we can build a lasting peace.

For this reason I have no doubt that we are right to make the hydrogen bomb
and it is a source of strength to the country that the Opposition should
support us in that step. Mr. Attlee, whose Government made the atomic
bomb, has agreed that we must possess this newer and still more powerful
deterrent In the face of its destructive power, any group of men would have
to be not only bad, but mad, to unleash a war This fact may be the greatest
force for peace.

But our policy needs more than a deterrent. It must have a more positive
side. We must seek to remove the distrust which today poisons the
atmosphere between East and West.

We have built the unity of the West, and our country has played a leading
part in this. We are now ready for wider discussion. We will spare no effort
to bring about meetings with the leaders of the Soviet Union and try to agree
around the table proposals which will make a fresh advance towards
disarmament and security for all peoples. I shall never despair of finding by
agreement solutions which will rid the world of fear.

At home we need a new authority if we are to develop the full sweep of our
plans, which offer enormous opportunities.

Within the lifetime of the Parliament which is about to be elected the first
stage of our programme to produce electricity from nuclear power will be
completed. What this means in material progress in Britain, how we plan to
effect a steady and accelerating increase in the living standards of every
section of our people, is set out in this document These projects will
inevitably take time but they can soon begin to revolutionise our national
life.

During the last three and a half years the Conservative Government has
achieved many of the aims proclaimed in 1951. We have seen solvency
succeed the threat of national bankruptcy. We have seen both employment
and earnings reach new high levels. We have seen new houses and new
schools and new factories built and building, and soon we shall see new
hospitals too. We have seen the social services extended and improved.

Now the time has come for a new effort and fresh advances. To realise them
we need a mandate measured not in months but in years. Here are some of
the demands we shall have to meet

We must fight with vigour the war on the slums and the war against ill-health
and disease. We must equip our rising generation with an education to fit
them for the requirements of this new age and to enable them to make the
best use of their talents. We must produce more and produce it more
efficiently. We must capture new markets overseas. We must save to invest

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

in the future - at home and in the Commonwealth and Empire.

To be successful we need a great national effort in which the fullest use is
made of our finest asset - the character of our people. For that character to
find its true expression we have to deepen our sense of national unity.

How can this be achieved? One way would be to try to impose it from the
top. The Conservative way is to encourage the growth of unity and
fellowship in a free and neighbourly society in which the people of every
calling work naturally together. I believe that this can be brought about if we
develop in this country what I have many times described as a property-
owning democracy.

Such ownership can be expressed in the home, in savings or in forms of
partnership in industry. It can take many shapes; but the essential theme is
clear. We are against increased ownership of power and property by the
State. We seek ever wider ownership of power and property by the people.
We aim at a community of free men and women working together for the
common good.

Anthony Eden

>

United for Peace and Progress

Two parties have governed in Great Britain in these post-war years. The
effective choice at this Election will lie between these two. Each will present
a manifesto of its beliefs and policy. Each will expound its theme at length
and at large. But a Party must not only be judged by what it says. It must be
judged even more by what it does. Therefore we ask the British people to
make this comparison now: Which were better for themselves, for their
families and for their country? The years of Socialism or the years of
Conservatism that have followed?

Let us look at the record.

Socialists had claimed that the political Left would be able to speak to the
Soviets in comradeship. This indeed proved an empty boast. They promised
that their methods of ""planning"" would make us masters of our economic
destiny. Yet they allowed one financial crisis after another to rock our land.
They pretended that their policy was bringing prosperity. In fact it opened up
an endless vista of filling in forms, cutting out coupons, applying for
permits, waiting on housing lists and standing in queues.

For six years their meddling and muddling made post-war problems harder
and gravely injured our strength. The climax came in 1951, when chronic
inflation at home cut more than 2s. off the value of every £ and the worst
balance of payments crisis in our history brought the nation to the brink of
bankruptcy.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

Contrast the position now with what it was in that dark hour. Under
Conservative administration we have broken away at long last from the
regular cycle of crises. We have proved, by re-establishing confidence in our
currency, by maintaining full employment, by restoring housewives choice
and by smashing housing records, that Conservative freedom works.

Indeed, we in Britain are producing, building, selling, earning and buying
more to-day than ever before. Personal savings have more than trebled since
1951. Judging by this alone the nation has regained faith in its own future.
Abroad, too, we have turned a more hopeful page. Imaginative diplomacy
has awakened respect for British leadership, and the new strength and unity
of the West should provide the essential basis on which we may seek an
understanding with the East.

The successes of Conservatism have now made possible a fine and ambitious
target. We believe that the British people have a real chance during the
coming twenty-five years to double their standard of living. The future
beckons to this generation with a golden finger. Peace can bring abundance
for all, if we match the opportunity with the will to prosper.

Conservatives do not pretend that the way ahead is easy. There will be no
lack of obstacles and dangers in our path. We shall need every ounce of
individual effort and resourcefulness that we can muster. We shall need a
spirit of partnership and a firm sense of duty to our country. We shall need a
general readiness to save as well as to spend. We shall need a Government
that will lead, and not hamper.

Socialists cannot be trusted to provide such a Government. They failed in
their six years of office. Their appeal to the Electorate in 1951 was founded,
not on constructive policies, but on scares - that we were warmongers, that
we would create mass unemployment, that we would slash the social
services - which experience has proved were lies. They have spent most of
their time in Opposition quarrelling with one another. On vital issues of State
policy they cannot speak as a united Party. In so far as they have a
programme at all, it consists of a mixture of more and more nationalisation
and a return to State restrictions and controls.

We do not question the sincerity of our political opponents. All Parties pray
for peace. All Parties desire no less the prosperity and welfare of the people.
These ends are not at issue between the Parties. The issue is: Which Party
has shown, in practice and in prospect, that it knows and can use the means
to secure them? If the lessons of yesterday are remembered, tomorrow can
be bright indeed. A vote for Socialism is a vote for the policy which was
tried and which failed. To vote Conservative is to invest in success.

In the following pages we outline the constructive proposals of the
Conservative and Unionist Party for the next five years, and the main themes
of our longer-term policy. Peace and security in the nuclear age; a
programme for prosperity; the development of a property-owning
democracy, and the strengthening of personal freedom and national unity -
these are our principal objectives in conducting the affairs of Government.

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

Our policy is a policy for Great Britain as a whole. Distinctive needs and
aspirations of Scotland and of Wales require special care and they receive
separate mention.

Peace and Security

Science in our day has unlocked the secret of atomic and nuclear power. The
future of our civilisation depends on the use to which mankind puts this
knowledge. Never in history have the issues of peace and war been more
sharply defined. For the same power that can forge weapons of mass
destruction can also confer blessings beyond all our dreams.

Already research, medicine and industry are making great and growing use
of atomic material manufactured in Britain. Already our country leads the
world in its programme of nuclear power stations for generating electricity.
We give our fullest support to President Eisenhower's initiative to develop
atoms for peace through an international agency, and will readily contribute
from our own resources.

Deterrents and Disarmament

Britain, like America and Russia, has also the knowledge and capacity to
make nuclear weapons. That we should use this knowledge is not in dispute
between the Parties. The Socialist Government made the atomic bomb. The
Socialist Opposition has said it shares our view that the possession of the
hydrogen bomb is necessary.

Why? Because to have the hydrogen bomb is today the best way of
preventing war; the best and perhaps the only way to convince the
Communists that they have nothing to gain, and indeed everything to lose,
from aggression, whereas the whole world has everything to gain from peace
and general disarmament.

The Conservative Government will continue to strive for world
disarmament. To be real, such disarmament must be balanced, all-round and
effectively controlled. We cannot agree to one-sided disarmament. The issue
is not simply whether to ban the hydrogen bomb. Our disarmament plan
makes it plain that this must be done. But banning the bomb alone would
make the risks of war not smaller but greater, as long as the Communists
retained their superiority in all other arms and in manpower. Therefore we
say we must not only abolish nuclear weapons, but also reduce armies and
armaments to a point where no one State can threaten the peace. We say too
that there must be effective international inspection and safeguards, applying
both to nuclear and other weapons. We have made in the United Nations far-
reaching and constructive proposals to these ends. Up to now the
Communist powers have rejected these proposals. But we do not give up
hope; and we shall not give up trying. For general disarmament such as we
have described is the only path to lasting peace and safety.

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

Peace Through Strength

Meanwhile our interest and duty is to make war less likely by building up,
with our allies, the most powerful deterrent to aggression we can achieve.
Our defence policy aims to bring each of the Services into line with the
strategy of the nuclear age, to arm each with the most modern weapons, to
improve conditions of life in the Forces, and to re-shape home defence
where the need for civilian services will remain vital.

The Conservative Party does not regard the current two years period of
whole time National Service as necessarily having come to stay. Its object is
twofold: to ensure that the active forces have enough men to carry out their
commitments and to build up trained reserves of skilled men for an
emergency. National Service is thus an instrument of our foreign and
Imperial policy. But it is not an end in itself. A Conservative Government
will continue to suit its application, and the period of service, to the needs of
the time.

In our policy of peace through strength we are not alone. With our
Commonwealth and Atlantic partners this country serves the common cause
of freedom and peace. We and other Commonwealth countries joined with
the United Nations in condemning and resisting aggression in Korea. We
play a leading part in the Atlantic Alliance, the main shield of peace and the
formal expression of Anglo-American solidarity. Britain too by her initiative
has helped to create Western European Union, the hub of the alliance
between the free peoples of the Continent.

In Western European Union we have undertaken an act of faith without
precedent in British history, in that we are pledged to keep our forces on the
Continent so long as they are needed by our European allies. This British
pledge, following the French rejection of E.D.C., led to the London and
Paris Agreements. It has restored the basis of European unity. It has
strengthened N.A.T.O. by giving America and Canada added confidence in
their European partners. It holds out the hope of a new and friendly
relationship between France and Germany.

The Soviets began to rearm Eastern Germany seven years ago. In carrying
forward the policy set on foot by the Labour Government of bringing the
German Federal Republic into the Western defence system, we have erected
a barrier to aggression, not to negotiation.

We should be wrong to minimise the fundamental issues of principle that
divide us from the Communist world. We cannot ignore the post-war record
of Communist subversion and attack, or their world-wide conspiracy to
undermine free institutions and to divide and confuse the free peoples. We
cannot excuse their denial of the rights of free worship and free expression.
Whatever the origins of Communist theory, its practice has led to the
extinction of freedom and the enthronement of tyranny wherever it has
spread. Only if we are firm in faith and spirit, and united in common purpose
with our allies, can we hope to achieve in time something better than a state
of cold war.

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

We are determined to keep our Western Alliance defensive in character, to
indulge in no provocation, to take advantage of every chance to settle
disputes. In the changed Soviet attitude towards the signature of an Austrian
Treaty, which we have repeatedly proposed, we may be seeing a first-fruit of
the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements. We hope that this new
mood may extend to other outstanding problems. It is still our hope that the
Soviet Government can be brought to agree to the unity of Germany on the
basis of free elections.

Now ratification is complete and the unity of the West assured, we shall
welcome and work for any high-level meeting or conference with the
Soviets which seems to be practicable and useful.

Diplomacy and Security

It would be a mistake to assume that nothing can be settled unless or until
everything is settled. During this period of Conservative Government a fresh
spirit of initiative and of refusal to accept stalemate has already been
successfully brought to bear on many problems which once seemed
insoluble. Not only was Western European Union. due to a British initiative,
but in the Korean armistice, in the Geneva settlement of the Indo-China war,
which could so easily have become a world conflict, and in the ending of the
Trieste dispute, our country has played a leading part.

On taking office we faced difficult and dangerous situations in Persia and
Egypt. Today there are agreements with both these countries. That with
Egypt has enabled us to redeploy our forces. That with Persia has meant that
oil is flowing from Abadan once again. Our prestige throughout this area has
been restored. Thus we have a better chance to continue helping the
countries of the Middle East in their plans both for defence and for economic
development, and also to work for a reconciliation between the Arab States
and Israel.

In the Formosa Straits we should like to see a guarantee on both sides not to
resort to force, and the withdrawal of Chinese Nationalist forces from the
coastal islands. This could lead to the reconsideration at an appropriate
moment both of Chinese representation in the United Nations and the future
status of Formosa.

The South-East Asia Treaty Organisation, guaranteeing the Geneva
settlement, is the first step towards collective security in this area. The basic
necessity is strength in arms; but social and economic betterment can be a
powerful reinforcement in less developed countries which might otherwise
be undermined by Communist infiltration. We shall make a real contribution
to the raising of living standards both under the Colombo Plan and through
the Agencies of the United Nations.

Commonwealth and Colonies

The British Commonwealth and Empire is the greatest force for peace and

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

progress in the world today. It comprises a quarter of the world's population.
It contains peoples of every race, of every religion, of every colour, and at
every stage of political and economic advance. It represents the most
fascinating and successful experiment in government and in international
relations ever known.

We are its founder member, and for a large part we are still directly
responsible. Other powerful communities have their territories confined
within a limited area. The Common wealth and Empire alone straddles the
globe. For us isolationism is impossible.

It is, therefore, of the first importance that machinery for consultation
between the self-governing partner members of the Commonwealth, already
so Close, should be steadily improved and perfected. Five times within less
than four years Commonwealth leaders have met together. In their approach
to world problems and economic policies an ever closer concord has been
established. We are in constant touch on foreign affairs and defence. As
opportunity offers, we should like to see Commonwealth Ministers with
responsibility for other aspects of public policy, such as the social services,
meeting and consulting together. It is the concept of a family council which
underlies our relationship and which must and shall endure.

We wish to strengthen the cohesion and influence of the Commonwealth. We
uphold the principle of racial partnership, as exemplified in the new
Federation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland so auspiciously launched and
increasingly enjoying the confidence of Europeans and Africans. We shall
work to raise living standards and to guide Colonial peoples along the road
to self-government within the framework of the Commonwealth and Empire.
We shall do all we can to insulate these problems from the heat of Party
conflict.

Economic Development

Commonwealth partnership enabled us to stave off the economic perils that
faced the whole Sterling Area at the time the Conservative Government took
over. It offers the best hope of prosperity for the future.

Conservative policy will stimulate the flow of private and public capital
from London for sound Empire development. Last year alone the
Government approved applications for new investment in the
Commonwealth to a total of £160 million. In addition there was much
private investment in the sterling Commonwealth which did not need
Government approval. Great wealth-creating projects are under way in all
the Commonwealth countries and in the Colonial territories too.

The peaceful uses of nuclear energy will be of the utmost benefit to
Commonwealth and Empire, and we are already helping a number of

Commonwealth countries with research and development programmes.

Like all countries of advanced development and democratic tradition, we

have responsibilities towards the less fortunate peoples of the world. We
have a special responsibility for the welfare and happiness of the seventy
millions who live in British Colonies, Protectorates and Trust Territories. We
must give them every help in their continuing assault on ignorance, want and
disease.

Special arrangements have been made to enable us to help industries in the
Colonies by treating them in certain circumstances as though they were
industries of the United Kingdom. A powerful contribution to better
conditions will continue to be made under the Colonial Development and
Welfare Acts which we have recently extended and improved. We shall seek
to promote capital investment in the improvement of Colonial
communications, the winning of minerals and the modernisation of
agriculture, with emphasis on peasant production. Measures to increase food
supplies must occupy a high place. Land utilisation and related problems in
East Africa have been examined by a Royal Commission whose conclusions
will have careful study.

Political Progress

From the shores of Africa westwards to the Caribbean and eastwards to the
Pacific Islands, the Colonies are thinking of their future. They differ vastly in
size, resources and tradition. Each must be helped to solve its own problems.
Our administrative and technical officers are doing fine work in fostering
political and economic advance. They still have a part to play in the self-
governing Colonies, for some of these also need and want their help.

So diverse are the circumstances that it would be unrealistic to lay down a
cut and dried time-table for the evolution of political maturity. Our purpose
and goodwill in achieving self-government for the Colonies are proclaimed
by recent constitutional advances in many parts of the Empire, for example
in West Africa. We believe that people in self-governing Colonies will find
greater security, prosperity and freedom by remaining part of the
Commonwealth. It is well known how easy a prey small, independent
countries can be to Communism or adverse economic circumstances.
Moreover, it is our responsibility to see that the rights of minorities are fully
safeguarded, and self-government can be granted only when we are certain
of this. In multi-racial communities we believe that the way to progress must
lie through a real racial partnership.

A Conservative Government would work to these ends throughout the
Colonies, judging each problem individually and striving to solve it without
prejudice. We shall maintain law and order wherever peaceful progress is

threatened; doing all in our power to settle rival claims, whether political,
religious, or racial, impartially, and with tolerance and humanity.

Programme for Prosperity

The economic policy of the Conservative Party is to help create the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

conditions in which the British people can steadily improve their standard of
living. As long as we conduct our affairs wisely and get on with the job of
raising the national product year by year, the country can be twice as well off
in twenty-five years time as it is now.

So we say: Let us strive to double our standard of living within this period.
Let every one have a firmer stake in the fortunes of his country. Let everyone
have a fuller chance to earn more and to own more, to get on and to have
more enjoyment as well. Given the boon of world peace, all this can be ours,
if we will work for it and save for it and so deserve to have it.

How, then, shall we invest in success?

First, we must believe in it. We need throughout the nation an ever-growing
sense of partnership and a lively spirit of venture. If we take pride in our
work, have confidence in one another, and are ready to give up out-worn
attitudes and methods for new, then we are already half-way to success.

Second, we must devote more of our resources to increasing productivity;
and this means saving as well as spending. First thought must go to
investment in productive forms of capital-factory and farm buildings, plant
and machinery, communications and power. This must be matched by far-
sighted educational policies to augment our scientific and technical skills.

Third, we must invest in wealth-creating schemes overseas, and especially in
the Commonwealth and Colonies. Development of their resources is a
practical example of our partnership and will make life better both for them
and for us.

Fourth, we must continue to sell more and earn more abroad. Only thus can
we pay for the extra raw materials we shall need for rising production, and
build up a trading surplus large enough to increase our investment overseas.
To expand world trade and our own share in the world's export markets is a
foremost task.

Men and women cannot be compelled or commanded or cajoled into greater
prosperity. Nor can such prosperity come overnight as a gift of Government.
What a Government can do is to encourage people to think and to act in
terms of expansion rather than restriction, of freedom rather than control.
The Conservative Government alone in post-war Britain has shown its
ability and willingness to do that.

Trade Not Aid

We live by world trade: the more world trade there is, the better we shall
live. We share in it, we ship it, we insure it and we help finance it. We have
been selling, and we shall have to go on selling, against fierce competition in
the markets of the world. The first object of our policy must be to enable
British industry to do this in what is likely to remain a buyer's market.

Therefore, we have got rid of a vast range of manufacturing controls and we

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

aim to stay rid of them. British industry must be adaptable, and ready not
only to hold old markets but to jump into new ones with new ideas and new
products. Freedom from control and a stable home economy are the true
foundations of a successful export trade; both would be in peril under
Socialism.

For our part, we intend to make our export trade a first charge upon our
resources. Without success in this field, neither defensive strength nor social
welfare can be achieved, and it is our object to achieve them both.

It is with this in mind that the Conservative Government has taken the lead
in organising a move towards a world-wide system of freer trade and freer
payments. The two must march together. We must re-establish sterling in a
position so strong and respected that it can play its full part as a major
international currency.

The solution of the complex problems involved will take time. It requires, in
particular, a suitable response from the dollar world, such as the President of
the United States has recommended. We in Britain have shown our goodwill
and intentions. For example, we have relaxed restrictions on imports from
Europe, and re-opened our international commodity markets.

Our aim being to expand trade, we must observe a system of trade rules
which makes such an expansion possible. This policy is in harmony with our
Commonwealth trade relations, and the Commonwealth countries
themselves pursue it. More than half our trade consists of purchases from or
sales to the Commonwealth and Empire. We have negotiated special
arrangements under the G.A.T.T. in the interests of Colonial industries.

It will be our constant aim to safeguard the special interests of the cotton
textile industry in the important interchanges taking place with other
Governments particularly concerned.

We have announced our decision that trade relations with Japan should
continue to be dealt with by mutually negotiated arrangements, and our
desire for a long-term commercial treaty.

We propose to strengthen our defences against unfair trade practices. The
Government has taken a leading part in seeking to obtain the elimination or
limitation of export subsidies in international trade. Material injury can be
caused to domestic industry through the use by other countries of these
devices, and we propose to take powers to impose countervailing and anti-
dumping duties in such cases and within the terms of our international
agreements.

Any country pursuing a policy of economic expansion and full employment
faces a constant danger of inflation. The risk is that home demand may take
away from the export trade and swell the import bill. Here sound monetary
and fiscal policies are powerful weapons. We propose to continue with their
flexible use.

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

An Expanding Economy

If Britain is to seize the opportunities which our trade policy can open up,
economic arrangements at home have got to be as modern and go-ahead as
we can possibly make them.

Conservatives neither minimise nor exaggerate the part that Governments
can play in bringing these conditions about. It is for the State to give a lead,
to provide incentive, support and advice, to protect the public interest and to
restrain abuse. But it is certainly no proper function of the State in normal
times to go into trade itself, to interfere in the day-to-day running of
business, or to tell housewives how to do their shopping. Within broad but
well-defined limits of basic public concer, we insist on freedom of action
for producers and freedom of choice for consumers.

Full Employment

Under Conservative administration a working population of record peace-
time size has been kept fully employed, without Socialist controls and
without continual inflation. Our record speaks for itself. In the intensely
competitive times ahead, continued full employment must mean, not only
everyone in a job, but everyone doing their job to the full. Only with a high
output - high earnings economy can we maintain and improve our trading
position.

The Government has sought, with an encouraging measure of success, to
create the right climate of confidence and to foster the idea of a common
interest and task. Team-work is an essential driving force of a dynamic
economy. There is really only one side in modern industry, and all of us are
on it. As Conservatives we have always believed this.

We shall follow up our work for better human relations in industry by
discussing with the joint advisory bodies of employers and Trade Unions,
and with the British Productivity Council, how best they can increase their
status and the scope of their work. We shall encourage such individual
employers as are not already doing so, to keep their workpeople regularly
and frankly informed of the fortunes and problems of their firm.

We wish to see proper rewards for extra skill, effort and responsibility.
Where they are suitable and desired, co-partnership and profit-sharing
schemes should be encouraged. They give employees a stake in the
prosperity of their firm and so contribute to our concept of a property-
owning democracy. We shall continue to assist better training within
industry.

We intend to launch a vigorous drive to promote the health, welfare and
safety of the working population, with the aid of our new Mines and
Quarries Act and of the recently established Industrial Health Advisory
Committee. Legislation will be passed to promote a steady improvement of
conditions for other workers, including those in transport and in farming, in

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

offices and in shops. We shall also introduce new legislation to safeguard the
employment of children.

Equal Pay

The Labour Party has been talking about equal pay for as long as anyone can
remember; it has taken a Conservative Government to do something about it
for its own employees. In fulfilment of our pledge at the last Election, the
principle of equal pay for equal work in the public service is now being
applied by stages.

Competitive Enterprise

We reaffirm our belief in the system of free competitive enterprise. The
Conservative Party is strongly opposed to any further measure of
nationalisation. We are equally anxious that private enterprise should be free
from any reproach of harmful restrictive practices. Many of these practices,
on both sides of industry, are relics of the past, quite out of place today.

The Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission, first suggested and
recently strengthened by the Conservatives, has started on the right path. Its
recommendations have been acted upon. The Conservative Government has
made a new approach by referring for examination certain practices which
cover a wide range of industry. This reference is likely to raise many issues
ranging from the existence of private trade courts to the right of proprietors
of branded goods to fix a uniform price for their products. These are
complex questions. Our policy is to obtain an impartial statement of the facts
and their effect on the national interest, and then to take the action
appropriate in each case.

Consumer Choice

Socialists, the makers of new monopolies, are posing now as the champions
of the consumer. Multiply the Ministries and clamp on the controls is what,
in effect, they say. But that was precisely their policy after the war. It led,
despite heavy food subsidies, paid for out of taxation, to a 40 per cent. rise in
the cost of living in six years and to the perpetuation of shortages and
queues, ration-books and black markets, snoopers and spivs. All these things
will inevitably come back if the Socialists get their way. They seem to think
that the British housewife is incapable of deciding for herself; we are sure
that it is the customer, and not ""the gentleman in Whitehall,"" who knows
best.

We warned the country at the last Election that it would take time and
immense efforts to stabilise the purchasing power of money. We claim to
have made progress. The cost of living has risen less in the past three years
than in the Socialists' last single year; and, what is more, the standard of
living of the great mass of the people has steadily and substantially
improved.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

Average industrial earnings and social security payments have gone ahead of
price rises. Clothes and many household goods are cheaper. We have
rejected policies which would deliberately deny to the housewife food in
plenty and plenty of choice. But we accept the obligation to continue to
work for more stable prices. We are certain that freedom and efficiency are
the keys to abundance and to lower cost.

Taxation and Investment

Efficiency is powerfully affected by taxation policy. If the toll of taxes is too
high, enterprise and thrift are discouraged; and lax Government spending
can itself be a root cause of inflation.

In an armed Welfare State the demands on taxable resources cannot be light.
This makes it all the more necessary that government, central and local,
should be run economic ally. There are today over 50,000 fewer civil
servants and four fewer Ministries than when we took over. Conservatives
will persist in the drive for simpler and less expensive administration.

We have already succeeded in making substantial reductions in P.A.Y.E. and
the Purchase Tax, and have introduced new allowances to help factory and
farm re-equipment. The 1955 budget is one more proof of our determination
to reduce where we can the burden of taxation on the individual, on the
family and on industry. We hope to make further progress in the years ahead.

We recognise the decline in the standard of living suffered since 1939 by
many salaried workers and by many who live on fixed incomes, savings and
pensions. They stand to benefit most from the more stable prices and lower
taxation which can be expected from a period of sound and steady
Government, but which Socialist policies would render impossible. Within
the limits set by our economic circumstances, we must seek to bring the
structure of the income tax into line with modern conditions, facilitate
provision for retirement, and pay regard to cases of hardship among those
who have served the State.

The Conservative Party acknowledges the part that budgetary policy can
play in stimulating saving and private investment. A striking rise n factory
building approvals and in new orders for machine tools has already followed
from our system of investment allowances.

We must see to it that manufacturing industry and agriculture are well
served. Ample supplies of steel are vital, particularly to our export trade, and
the denationalised iron and steel industry, which is breaking production
records month by month, has now embarked on a further programme of
capital investment and expansion. Up-to-date means of transport and ready
sources of power are equally essential. For this purpose, those sections of
our economy that remain nationalised must be brought to a higher peak of
efficiency. Here again, investment is an important factor.

Transport

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 14 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

We must move our goods swiftly to markets, shops and homes, and to the
ports for our overseas trade. In work and at leisure we look to our railways,
roads and airways to give us efficient service. It is Conservative policy to see
that they do. The spur of competition which we have provided will certainly
help. In addition, both railways and roads require vigorous development to
make up for the time lost in the years of war and of Socialism.

We shall make it possible for the British Transport Commission to push on
with its comprehensive plan of modernisation and re-equipment, so that the
railways may earn their own living and a good wage for those who work on
them. The public and industry are entitled to a better service.

We have already started on the first big programme of road construction
since the war. The first great motorways to be built in this country will help
traffic to flow between our cities. But we will not sacrifice safety to speed.
Our programme also includes the elimination of hundreds of accident ""black
spots"". This will be combined with intensive propaganda, the new highway
code and fresh legislation in a drive for greater safety.

Air transport gives us new highways. Experience has shown that a blend of
public and private enterprise is best for this service. Close co-operation with
shipping can often be of great value. The Airways Corporations will
continue to have an important role; we shall ensure that their relationships
with independent operators are developed in the interests of traveller, trader
and taxpayer.

Fuel and Power

Britain built her industrial supremacy on coal. We shall continue to need all
the coal we can get. But we must look to new sources of energy as well to
meet the demands of an expanding economy.

The peaceful uses of nuclear energy can make an incalculable contribution
to the raising of living standards. A new industrial era may indeed be
ushered in when the atom has been harnessed to bring everyday heat, light
and power to factory, farm and home. Quietly, unobtrusively, our scientists
have been working; and the Conservative Government has now become the
first in the world to launch a programme of nuclear power stations on a
commercial scale. This will be pressed ahead at the utmost speed.

The National Coal Board has now been reorganised. The efficiency of
nationalised electricity is also under independent examination.

We intend to increase capital investment in new pits and major
reconstruction schemes to four times what it was when we took over in
1951. Greater supplies of good coal would not only be gratifying to the user,
including the housewife, but also a substantial help to our balance of
payments. We recognise that as far as one can see ahead the demand for coal
will outstrip capacity. So we must make coal work harder, and economise in
its use, by extending our industrial loan scheme and by other means. We
must also supplement our coal with oil, and in particular ensure by

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 15 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

progressive conversion of electric power stations that their mounting fuel
needs can be met by oil instead of coal.

Science and Invention

Our country's prosperity is bound up with her scientific knowledge and the
extent to which her industrialists and farmers make use of it. We therefore
place a strong emphasis in our educational policy upon the expansion of
scientific and technological training. We shall continue to promote and
encourage research both in private industry and State establishments.

We regard the widest possible spread of scientific information as a major
factor in modern progress. With this in mind we shall take early steps to
expand the Patent Office Library into a National Reference Library of
Science and Invention, and to develop a National Lending Library of
Science and Technology whose facilities will be available to all British
firms, large and small.

Agriculture and Fisheries

Side by side with the expansion of other productive industries Britain needs
a strong and progressive agriculture, and always will do. The Conservative
Party gives a pledge to the farming community that so long as we are
responsible there will be fair prices for good farming, orderly marketing of
the main farm products, and no nationalisation of the land.

By support prices, deficiency payments and other means, we shall uphold the
principle of the 1947 Agriculture Act. We have shown, for example with
milk, potatoes and eggs, our firm belief in Producer Marketing Boards where
these have majority support and safeguard consumers and taxpayers.
Marketing arrangements should continue to put a premium on efficiency.

The more efficient our agriculture continues to grow, the better it will be for
everyone. The farmer will become more independent. There will be more
scope for increased production. The housewife will be better satisfied. And
the taxpayer will need to find less in agricultural subsidies, which are now
running at the formidable rate of some £250 million a year.

We must, therefore, direct our main effort to the wide range of farm
production where the overseas supplier has no natural advantage. We should
save unnecessary imports of feeding stuffs by concentrating on grass and ley
farming. To encourage good husbandry and to help the small farmer in
particular, the wide range of improvement and other production grants must
be continued. We shall take care that credit facilities are adequate. There will
be further development of the Government's research, education and
advisory services. By these and other means we shall provide the
knowledge, advice and incentive needed to secure the maximum economic
production from our land.

Under Conservative Government country workers are assured of better

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

housing conditions, better schools for their children and more village halls.
Three out of every four farms and cottages will be linked to a main
electricity supply on the completion of a major five-year programme which
we have initiated. We have doubled the amount paid annually in grants for
rural water supplies and sewerage; this progress will be kept up, and further
funds made available.

We have taken steps within our international agreements which have enabled
us to increase the tariffs on a number of horticultural products. With a view
to improving the marketing of fruit and vegetables, we shall give close study
to the conclusions of the recently established inquiry.

The marketing of home-grown timber is now under review. We wish to see
greater use made of the grants available to private woodland owners.

The needs of the fishing industry will have constant attention. Further efforts
will be made towards improving international control of over-fishing.
Investment in research and the building of new vessels will continue to
receive steady Government aid.

The Task Ahead

This is an age of challenge and opportunity. In the first half of the century we
had to sacrifice our wealth and our overseas investments in two world wars:
in the struggle for life and freedom we diminished our commercial strength.
Now in this second half of the century, more dependent than ever on our
foreign trade in an increasingly competitive world, we must venture for
livelihood and prosperity. Ours are long-term problems: they cannot be
settled and solved automatically by an Act of Parliament, by some trick of
organisation, by one short spurt of intense activity. We can never allow a
mood of complacency and inertia to settle down upon us.

After these few years of Conservative Government, the economy is in much
better shape, and the nation in much better heart. Now we must harness these
assets to a new and powerful surge of national effort.

Socialism would merely hinder this task. Instead of thinking how to expand
wealth in which all can share, the Socialists continue to ""plan"" the equal
division of scarcity. Instead of looking forward to the next twenty-five years,
they are still parroting the untruths and half-truths of twenty-five years ago.
Instead of learning from the many mistakes they made when in office, they
are obstinately preparing to repeat them. Their partisan attitudes would
create disunity among the people and undermine business confidence. Their
policies would involve an increase in Government spending so huge that
there could be no saving for purposes of investment. Their immediate
contribution to our trading problems would be to nationalise and disrupt
some of our most efficient and progressive export industries.

We offer the nation a programme for prosperity; they offer a blue-print for
disaster.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

Home and Family

Britain's greatest asset has always lain in the gifts and character of her
people. It must be the purpose of a vigorous and progressive society to
enable this asset to be fully and freely developed. Our programme for
prosperity can succeed only if the nation is in good heart and good health,
well housed and well educated. All must be secure in the possession of a
basic standard of life; and all must be free to rise above it as far as their
industry and talents may take them.

We denounce the Labour Party's desire to use the social services, which we
all helped to create, as an instrument for levelling down. We regard social
security, not as a substitute for family thrift, but as a necessary basis or
supplement to it. We think of the National Health Service as a means, not of
preventing anyone from paying anything for any service, but of ensuring that
proper attention and treatment are denied to no-one. We believe that equality
of opportunity is to be achieved, not by sending every boy and girl to exactly
the same sort of school, but by seeing that every child gets the schooling
most suited to his or her aptitudes. We see a sensible housing policy in
terms, not of one hopeless Council waiting list, but of adequate and
appropriate provision both for letting and for sale.

We wish to develop in our country the idea of a property-owning democracy.
That means that people should be owners as well as earners. Our theme is
that property, power and responsibility alike must not become absorbed into
the State machine, but be widely spread throughout the whole of the
community. To this end, we shall encourage home ownership. We shall
foster thrift. We shall stimulate a spirit of partnership in industry. We shall
maintain the independence of the small trader and landowner and of the
professional man. We shall cherish local democracy. We shall strengthen the
rights of the individual. The aim and consequence of Conservative policy
will be to enable men and women, in alt the groups to which they belong, to
lead their own lives in their own way within the limits of law and the
obligations of good neighbourliness.

Liberty and the Law

Justice between citizen and citizen, and justice between citizen and State
must be upheld and strengthened.

The Conservative Party regretted that economic difficulties made it
necessary for the Socialist Government to defer indefinitely the operation of
important parts of the Legal Aid and Advice Act. We are now preparing to
extend legal aid to proceedings in the County Courts, and also intend during
the life of the next Parliament to introduce the comprehensive scheme for
legal advice.

We have cut back war-time powers and regulations which trespassed upon
British liberties. Seven out of every ten have been eliminated, and we shall
take steps to deal with the rest.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 18 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

We are determined that, in exercising the normal powers of Government in a
modern State, a just balance should be struck, and seen to be struck, between
the interests of the individual and those of the community. There is no
ground for belief that, as a general rule, justice is not substantially done; but
we consider that there is room for further improvement in the machinery of
tribunals, of public inquiries and of departmental decisions affecting
individual interests and property. The public has a right to be assured on
these matters. We shall therefore appoint a strong advisory Committee,
representative of a wide range of public life and service, to give practical
attention to these problems of administrative law and recommend action. We
shall ask them to consider as a matter of particular urgency whether changes
are needed in the present practice and procedure of compulsory acquisition.

Wherever possible we shall reduce the acreage of land now owned by the
State, and shall press ahead with the derequisitioning of Government-held
buildings. Local authorities must also restore requisitioned houses and flats
to their owners as speedily as possible, without causing hardship to present
occupiers.

Houses and Amenities

Our aim is to ensure that every family has a decent home to live in. Our
Party's pledge to build 300,000 houses a year was derided by our opponents
as impossible to fulfil. In fact nearly 350,000 were built last year, and at least
as many are likely to be built this year. Already under Conservative
Government a million new homes have been provided.

Only under Conservative administration can the nation be sure of a housing
policy in line with its needs.

Now that the construction of new homes is going ahead so well, we shall be
able to devote a larger part of our resources to the elimination of slums and
the modernisation of the older houses.

There has been only one full-scale slum clearance drive in British history,
and that was when Conservatives were in office in the late 'thirties. Now,
under Conservative Government, there is going to be another. We shall root
out the slums at an increasing pace, and aim to re house at least 200,000
people a year from them.

People are already benefiting from the repair, improvement and conversion
of the older houses in which they live. They should remember that the
Labour Party voted in Parliament against the Act which gave recent impetus
to this work. The Conservative Government will do all it can to encourage
private owners and local authorities to make fuller use of the improvement
grants available.

With the abolition of building licences, the competitive efficiency of the
private builder can now play its full part in keeping down costs. This will
help more people to afford a home of their own. We shall encourage local
authorities to adopt schemes which enable the Building Societies to accept a

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 19 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

smaller cash deposit. We shall also seek means of including legal costs in the
money advanced to house purchasers, and review the rate of the Stamp Duty,
particularly on smaller homes.

In this crowded Island we must not build without giving careful thought to
where we build. Conservatives will see that good farm land is protected, that
big towns are restrained from sprawling haphazardly into the countryside,
and that development to relieve over crowded cities takes place where, and
only where, there will be work and amenities available for the people who
move.

Within the home we wish to see domestic tasks lightened by improved
labour-saving and fuel-saving appliances, and the most modern amenities.

More than a thousand new telephones a day are now being installed, and we
intend to speed up this record progress.

The new medium of television, which is becoming ever more important in
our lives, must not be under monopoly control. Conservatives have ensured
that alternative and competing television programmes will soon be available.
Measures to improve reception of sound broadcasts where necessary must
also go forward.

Education

The most urgent problem in education since the war has been to provide for
the huge rise in the school roll. Under Conservative Government a record
number of new schools has been completed and a record number of teachers
recruited. We have kept pace with the growth in the school population.

Now we can draw ahead, bring down the size of classes, improve existing
buildings and equipment, and extend facilities for scientific and technical
training.

In the next five years we shall provide at least another million new school
places, mostly in secondary schools. In this period we intend to complete the
reorganisation of all-age classes in the rural areas and make good progress
with reorganisation in the towns. We shall also tackle the problem of the
slum schools.

Local authorities have been given greater freedom to improve existing
schools. More generous assistance is now available to voluntary schools,
whose religious teaching is of the utmost importance. Grants will continue to
be given for playing fields, community centres and youth clubs. In all this
expansion we shall see that no money is wasted.

Under the Conservatives the number of teachers has increased by 6,000 a
year. In the next five years we aim at least to maintain this rate and so secure
the reduction in the size of classes. We are anxious that the status and
rewards of the teaching profession should continue to attract men and

teachers representatives and local authorities an up-to-date pensions scheme.

What matters in education is the development of the child's talents and
personality, not the forwarding of a political theory. To prepare for the
increasing opportunities of the modern world we need all three kinds of
secondary school, grammar, modern and technical, and we must see that
each provides a full and distinctive education. We shall not permit the
grammar schools to be swallowed up in comprehensive schools. It is vital to
build up secondary modern schools, and to develop in them special
vocational courses, so that they and the technical schools offer a choice of
education that matches the demands of our expanding economy. Parents
should have the chance before the eleven-plus examination to discuss with
teachers and the local education authority which school is likely to suit their
child best. There must be proper provision for the later transfer of children
from one type of school to another.

We accept the case that family allowances should be paid as long as a child
is at school. A system of increased maintenance allowances will be
introduced for senior pupils who might otherwise leave school before
finishing an advanced course.

We shall build more technical colleges and seek the co-operation of industry
in making their day courses a success. Further funds will be made available
for major or specialised developments in higher technological education.

Conservatives will continue to guarantee the present freedom of the
Universities from Government interference. We favour greater uniformity in
the scales of County awards to University students.

Good Health

New hospital building was completely neglected by the Socialist
Government. A start is now being made. Plans have been announced and
will be carried out over the next few years for the building of new hospitals,
both general and mental, and for the extension and modernisation of many
existing hospitals. We are making special arrangements to replace worn out
and obsolete hospital plant and equipment. We shall seek to open new beds
where they are most needed, to recruit extra staff and to provide better
facilities. We desire to see steady progress in all forms of preventive work.
These are our priorities: we rank them higher than free wigs or free aspirins.

We believe that private practice and contributory schemes have a part to play
with the National Health Service and we shall therefore maintain the system
of hospital amenity and hospital pay beds. We have cut away restrictions on
voluntary effort in the hospital service. We shall continue to give every
encouragement to voluntary work.

We welcome the increase in the provision of dental treatment, especially for

mothers, children and young people, and we wish in co-operation with the
profession to push forward with preventive measures.

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

The problems of the elderly must concern us all. In particular we shall
encourage local health authorities to build up their home help services and to
provide half-way houses"" for the old.

We shall introduce legislation to give effective status to those, known as
medical auxiliaries, who assist doctors in investigation and treatment.

We are anxious to provide the best National Health Service the country can
afford. We set up the Guillebaud Committee to study the problems involved
and await its recommendations.

The steady fall in infant and maternal mortality rates is a wonderful measure
of the nation's better health. Quarter by quarter the records are being broken.
We are winning the fight against tuberculosis. Still a great challenge remains
for all concerned with the prevention and cure of disease. We shall make
sure that adequate funds are available for medical research, and in particular
that hopeful lines of inquiry into cancer and polio are urgently pursued.

Air pollution is an enemy to good health, and can cause death. We
wholeheartedly accept the need for a national ""clean air"" policy. The use of
smokeless fuels must be encouraged wherever they can readily be made
available, and comprehensive legislation on smoke abatement will be
introduced.

Pensions and Benefits

The nation has assumed very large obligations towards the pensioners of
tomorrow; and tomorrow there will be very many more pensioners. For
every 10 people of working age there are now 2 of pensionable age; but
within a quarter of a century there will be 3. If during this period Britain can
increase her national wealth and resources, by the policy of investment and
enterprise which we advocate, these obligations can be met. But if wealth is
dissipated, enterprise hampered and severe inflation brought about again by
Socialist short-sightedness, the whole of our National Insurance scheme
would be undermined and ultimately destroyed.

In its first year of office the Conservative Government increased virtually all
social service payments. This year it has again raised pensions and benefits,
and fully restored the purchasing power that Parliament intended they should
have when the main rates were fixed after the war. Insurance pensioners, war
pensioners and public service pensioners can be sure that a Conservative
Government will continue to give the most constant attention to their
interests and needs.

It is our wish to avoid any change in the present minimum pension ages. But
these ages do not necessarily represent the limit of working life. With the aid
of its National Advisory Committee the Government will continue to
encourage the employment, without regard to age, of all who can give
effective service and wish to do so.

Local Government

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 22 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

The social policy we have outlined will make heavy demands on the
energies and capacity of local authorities up and down the country. They
must be strong and well-equipped if they are to carry out these
responsibilities effectively.

The problems of local government finance will receive our urgent attention.
They must be considered afresh in the light of present-day conditions. When
the effects of the new valuations can be fully measured, we shall review the
proportion of the rate burden falling upon the different groups of those who
occupy property and we shall consider whether any changes are needed to
remove injustice. We shall examine possible ways of supplementing the rate,
including the revision of Government grants. A fundamental and continuing
duty will rest upon every local Council to run their services economically
and to see that ratepayers and taxpayers get full value for money.

After first seeking to establish the widest measure of common ground
between local authorities of all kinds, the Conservative Government in the
coming Parliament will introduce effective machinery for adapting local
government to modern needs. In so doing we shall give full weight to
valuable local traditions.

The proper allocation of functions must be considered at the same time. As
Conservatives we believe that, consistent with efficiency and economy, local
government should be as local as possible. So long as we are in office, there
is no danger from proposals to strip local government of further powers. On
the contrary, we shall seek to secure a wider range of interesting and
constructive work for the smaller authorities. Only in this way can we
continue to attract to local government the ablest men and women, and
ensure that services closely touching the daily lives of everyone are not
subjected to impersonal control from aloft and afar.

Scottish Affairs

It is our general theme that within the Union the responsibility for managing
Scottish affairs shall be in the hands of Scotsmen.

We have ensured that a senior member of the Government shall be
constantly in Scotland, and have already transferred from Whitehall to
Scotland a variety of additional responsibilities. Next year, in accordance
with the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Scottish Affairs, the
Secretary of State will take over the care of Scottish roads and bridges.
Where further measures of this kind are shown to be in the best interests of
Scotland, we shall not hesitate to adopt them.

Industry and Employment

Each year since the Unionists took office, the number of people at work in
Scotland has grown and now stands at a record level. As part of our policy
for maintaining full employment, we aim to attract the widest variety of new

industrial enterprise to the areas where it is most needed. We shall review the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 23 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

facilities now available for the building of small and medium-sized factories.
We shall see that Scotland continues to receive her fair share of defence and
other contracts.

Scottish needs will be fully assessed in framing our new programmes of road
construction and railway modernisation. Approval has been given to the
building of the Whiteinch - Linthouse Tunnel under the Clyde, and we have
announced that a start will be made within the next four years on the
construction of a Forth Road Bridge or Tube.

Countryside and Highlands

Within the framework of our agricultural policy, the special requirements of
farming on Scottish hill and marginal land will receive particular attention.
The measure we have passed to assist the reconditioning of farm workers'
houses must continue to be used with vigour. Still faster progress must be
made in bringing water supplies to the rural areas, and the funds available
for this purpose will be increased.

We are certain that the Crofting Counties can make a growing contribution
to the national wealth. Every practicable step will be taken to improve the
prosperity and welfare of the Highlands. We are giving particular attention to
the special importance of road works.

We shall maintain, and where necessary extend, measures to modernise and
increase the efficiency of the Scottish fishing fleets.

Building and Rebuilding

Never before in Scottish history has the rate of house-building been so high
as in these years of Unionist Government. We fully recognise the compelling
seriousness of Scotland's housing problem. We are determined to root out the
slums, redevelop the over crowded and decayed areas in our towns and
cities, and rehouse the people in modern homes. We intend to ensure that
this redevelopment will provide balanced communities with all the
necessities for a full life. This policy, together with house-building
throughout Scotland, will receive impetus from a reform of the Scottish
rating system.

We propose to expand the hospital building programme and in particular to
provide more accommodation for the old, the chronic sick, the mentally ill
and those with tuberculosis.

We also propose to speed up the school building programme. We shall aim at
the establishment of local technical colleges in Scotland, and make increased
provision for developments in higher technological education in our great
cities. Thus we shall train our youth of today to meet the challenge of
tomorrow, and enable Scotland to maintain a proper place in the forefront of
twentieth-century progress.

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

Welsh Affairs

The appointment of a Minister for Welsh Affairs in the Conservative
Government has ensured that Welsh interests and problems are represented
at the highest level with a force and directness which previous methods of
co-ordination had been unable to achieve. At the same time, a steady policy
of administrative devolution has been followed. This policy should go on
and, if possible, go further.

The Council for Wales and Monmouthshire is engaged in a detailed
examination of the arrangements for conducting Government business in
Wales, and we shall consider, in the light of the Council's advice, such
further changes as it may be practicable and advantageous to make in the
present system.

Education

We are sympathetic to all measures designed to preserve Welsh culture and
educational tradition. We shall continue to give strong encouragement and
support to the teaching of the Welsh language and to the use of Welsh as a
medium of instruction n schools.

Employment and Development

Unemployment under the Conservative Government has touched the lowest
levels ever recorded in Wales in time of peace. We recognise the need for
imaginative and tireless attention to the stubborn problems that remain. We
shall do everything in our power to improve the competitive position of the
Development Area and the South Wales ports, and to attract suitable industry
to North-West Wales.

The Conservative Party is determined to promote a more stable economy
and fuller development of resources in rural Wales. A thorough investigation
of agricultural problems and land use is now in progress and action will be
guided by the recommendations which emerge.

We shall press forward with the building and reconditioning of houses and
the extension of sewerage, water supplies and electricity. Where the
improvement of now unadopted roads in livestock rearing areas would
materially assist farm economy, new grants will be made available for the
purpose.

We wish to increase the extent and the pace of afforestation in Wales. This
can provide employment for the younger generation, not only in forestry
itself, but in the many dependent industries that will grow up around the
forests. Co-operation between farmers, private woodland owners and the
Forestry Commission can make this policy a success.

Constitutional Questions

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1955/1955-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 25 of 27

1955 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

The Constitution of the United Kingdom is the essential safeguard of our
democratic government and way of life. We intend that it should retain its
rightful place above Party politics.

Northern Ireland

We renew the pledge of faith to Northern Ireland. We shall not allow her
position as an integral part of the United Kingdom and of the Empire to be
altered in the slightest degree without the consent of the Northern Ireland
Parliament.

It has long been the Conservative wish to reach a settlement regarding the
reform of the House of Lords, so that it may continue to play its proper role
as a Second Chamber under the Constitution. The Labour Party's refusal to
take part in the conversations we have proposed on this subject must not be
assumed to have postponed reform indefinitely. We shall continue to seek the
co-operation of others in reaching a solution. We believe that any changes
made now should be concerned solely with the composition of the House.

House of Commons

It will also be our aim to achieve all-Party agreement to amend the rules
governing the redistribution of Parliamentary constituencies. We hold the
opinion that a longer interval between general reviews would be more
appropriate, and that mathematical equality between electorates ought not to
be an over-riding consideration.

The Nation's Choice

We confidently commend to the judgement of the Electorate the policy and
principles we have outlined in these pages.

It is our profound belief that the British nation has a high destiny and a
glorious future before it. In stemming the tide of Communism, promoting
the concord of nations and finding the way to peace, Britain has a central and
crucial part to play. A great mission and adventure awaits us in the Empire
and Commonwealth where rich resources can bring prosperity and plenty to
all our peoples and to all our friends. At home, the high standards of life we
now enjoy may be doubled within a generation, by enterprising work, by far
sighted investment - and by wise leadership.

Who can believe that the Socialists today, out-moded in thought and divided
in counsel, are fitted to give such leadership?

They still cling to the broken reed of nationalisation; we work for a property-
owning democracy. They rely on officialdom; we rely on enterprise. Their
policy is to multiply restraints; our policy is to multiply opportunities.
Themselves divided, they would divide the nation. We Conservatives place
our political faith in the unity of our country, in the neighbourliness of its
spirit, in the vigour of its character, and in the liberties of its subjects.

1951 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

We are confronted with a critical Election which may well be the turning
point in the fortunes and even the life of Britain. We cannot go on with this
evenly balanced Party strife and hold our own in the world, or even earn our
living. The prime need is for a stable government with several years before
it, during which time national interests must be faithfully held far above
party feuds or tactics. We need a new Government not biased by privilege or
interest or cramped by doctrinal prejudices or inflamed by the passions of
class warfare. Such a Government only the Conservative and Unionist Party
can to-day provide.

There must be no illusions about our difficulties and dangers. It is better to
face them squarely as we did in 1940. The Conservative Party, who since
victory have had no responsibility for the events which have led us to where
we are now, offers no bribes to the electors. We will do our best to serve
them and to make things better all round, but we do not blind ourselves to
the difficulties that have to be overcome, or the time that will be required to
bring us back to our rightful position in the world, and to revive the vigour
of our national life and impulse.

We all seek and pray for peace. A mighty union of nations tread that path
together, but we all know that peace can only come through their united
strength and faithful brotherhood.

Contrast our position to-day with what it was six years ago. Then all our foes
had yielded. We all had a right to believe and hope that the fear of war
would not afflict our generation nor our children. We were respected,
honoured and admired throughout the world. We were a united people at
home, and it was only by being united that we had survived the deadly perils
through which we had come and had kept the flag of freedom flying through
the fateful year when we were alone. There, at any rate, is a great foundation
and inspiration. Everyone knows how the aftermath of war brings
extraordinary difficulties. With national unity we could have overcome them.
But what has happened since those days?

The attempt to impose a doctrinaire Socialism upon an Island which has
grown great and famous by free enterprise has inflicted serious injury upon
our strength and prosperity. Nationalisation has proved itself a failure which
has resulted in heavy losses to the taxpayer or the consumer, or both. It has
not given general satisfaction to the wage-earners in the nationalised
industries. It has impaired the relations of the Trade Unions with their
members. In more than one nationalised industry the wage-earners are ill-
content with the change from the private employers, with whom they could

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1951/1951-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 6

1951 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

negotiate on equal terms through the Trade Unions, to the all-powerful and
remote officials in Whitehall.

Our finances have been brought into grave disorder. No British Government
in peace time has ever had the power or spent the money in the vast extent
and reckless manner of our present rulers. Apart from the two thousand
millions they have borrowed or obtained from the United States and the
Dominions, they have spent more than 10 million pounds a day, or 22
thousand millions in their six years. No community living in a world of
competing nations can possibly afford such frantic extravagances.
Devaluation was the offspring of wild, profuse expenditure, and the evils
which we suffer to-day are the inevitable progeny of that wanton way of
living.

A Conservative Government will cut out all unnecessary Government
expenditure, simplify the administrative machine, and prune waste and
extravagance in every department.

The greatest national misfortune which we now endure is the ever falling
value of our money, or, to put it in other words, the ever-increasing cost,
measured in work and skill, of everything we buy. British taxation is higher
than in any country outside the Communist world. It is higher by eight
hundred millions a year than it was in the height of the war. We have a
population of fifty millions depending on imports of food and raw materials
which we have to win by our exertions, ingenuity, and craftsmanship. Since
Devaluation it takes nearly twelve hours of work with hands or brains to buy
across the dollar exchange what we could have got before for eight hours.
We have now to give from one-quarter to one-third more of our life's
strength, skill and output of every kind and quality to get the same intake as
we did before Devaluation two years ago. We pay more for what we buy
from abroad. we get less for what we sell. That is what Socialist Devaluation
has meant. This costly expedient has not prevented a new financial crisis.

We are a hard working people. We are second to none in ability or enterprise
so far as we are allowed to use these gifts. We now have the only Socialist
Government in the Empire and Commonwealth. Of all the countries in the
world Britain is the one least capable of bearing the Socialist system.

The Nation now has the chance of rebuilding its life at home and of
strengthening its position abroad. We must free ourselves from our
impediments. Of all impediments the class war is the worst. At the time
when a growing measure of national unity is more than ever necessary, the
Socialist Party hope to gain another lease of power by fomenting class
hatred and appealing to moods of greed and envy.

Within the limits of a statement of this kind, it is only possible to deal with
some of the main questions now before us. We wish to be judged by deeds
and their results and not by words and their applause. We seek to proclaim a
theme, rather than write a prospectus. Many years ago I used the phrase,
""Bring the rearguard in."" This meant basic standards of life and labour, the
duty of the strong to help the weak, and of the successful to establish

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1951/1951-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 6

1951 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

tolerable conditions for the less fortunate. That policy is adopted by all
Parties to-day. But now we have the new Socialist doctrine. It is no longer,
""Bring the rearguard in,"" but ""Keep the vanguard back."" There is no means
by which this Island can support its present population except by allowing
its native genius to flourish and fructify. We cannot possibly keep ourselves
alive without the individual effort, invention, contrivance, thrift and good
housekeeping of our people.

In 1945 I said:

""What we desire is freedom; what we need is abundance. Freedom and
abundance - these must be our aims. The production of new wealth is far
more beneficial than class and Party fights about the liquidation of old
wealth. We must try to share blessings and not miseries. The production of
new wealth must precede common wealth, otherwise there will only be
common poverty.

It is because these simple truths have been denied and our people duped by
idle hopes and false doctrine that the value of our money has fallen so
grievously and the confidence of the world in Britain has been impaired.
Confidence and currency are interdependent and restoring confidence by
sound finance is one of the ways in which the value of our money may be
sustained and the rising cost of living checked.

The Conservative aim is to increase our national output. Here is the surest
way to keep our people fully employed, to halt the rising cost of living, and
to preserve our social services. Hard work, good management, thrift - all
must receive their due incentive and reward.

In the wider world outside this Island we put first the safety, progress and
cohesion of the British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations. We must all
stand together and help each other with all our strength both in Defence and
Trade. To foster commerce within the Empire we shall maintain Imperial
Preference. In our home market the Empire producer will have a place
second only to the home producer.

Next, there is the unity of the English-speaking peoples who together
number hundreds of millions. They have only to act in harmony to preserve
their own freedom and the general peace.

On these solid foundations we should all continue to labour for a United
Europe, including in the course of time those unhappy countries still behind
the Iron Curtain.

These are the three pillars of the United Nations Organisation which, if
Soviet Russia becomes the fourth, would open to all the toiling millions of
the world an era of moral and material advance undreamed of hitherto
among men. There was a time in our hour of victory when this object
seemed to be within our reach. Even now, in spite of the clouds and
confusion into which we have since fallen, we must not abandon the
supreme hope and design.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1951/1951-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 6

1951 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

For all these purposes we support the Rearmament programme on which the
Socialist Government have embarked. We believe however that far better
value could be got for the immense manpower and sums of money which are
involved. Special sacrifices are required from us all for the sake of our
survival as free democratic communities and the prevention of war.

Our theme is that in normal times there should be the freest competition and
that good wages and profits fairly earned under the law are a public gain
both to the Nation and to all in industry-management and wage-earner alike.
But the vast Rearmament policy of spending five thousand millions in three
years on Defence inevitably distorts the ordinary working of supply and
demand, therefore justice requires special arrangements for the emergency.
We shall set our face against the fortuitous rise in company profits because
of the abnormal process of Rearmament. We shall accordingly impose a
form of Excess Profits Tax to operate only during this exceptional period.

At the same time a revision of the existing system of taxation on commercial
and industrial profits is required. Relief will be given in cases where profits
are ploughed back and used for the renewal of plant and equipment.

We believe in the necessity for reducing to the minimum possible all
restrictive practices on both sides of industry, and we shall rely on a greatly
strengthened Monopolies Commission to seek, and enable Parliament to
correct, any operations in restraint of trade, including of course in the
nationalised industries.

I will now mention some other practical steps we shall take.
We shall stop all further nationalisation.

The Iron and Steel Act will be repealed and the Steel industry allowed to
resume its achievements of the war and post-war years. To supervise prices
and development we shall revive, if necessary with added powers, the
former Iron and Steel Board representing the State, the management, labour,
and consumers.

Publicly-owned rail and road transport will be reorganised into regional
groups of workable size. Private road hauliers will be given the chance to
return to business, and private lorries will no longer be crippled by the
twenty-five mile limit.

Coal will remain nationalised. There will be more decentralisation snd
stimulation of local initiative and loyalties, but wage negotiations will
remain on a national basis.

All industries remaining nationalised will come within the purview of the
Monopolies' Commission and there will also be strict Parliamentary review
of their activities.

We seek to create an industrial system that is not only efficient but human.
The Conservative Workers' Charter for Industry will be brought into being as
early as possible, and extended to agriculture wherever practicable. The

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1951/1951-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 6

1951 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

scheme will be worked out with trade unions and employers, and then laid
before Parliament.

There you have a clear plan of action in this field.

Housing is the first of the social services. It is also one of the keys to
increased productivity. Work, family life, health and education are all
undermined by overcrowded homes. Therefore a Conservative and Unionist
Government will give housing a priority second only to national defence.
Our target remains 300,000 houses a year. There should be no reduction in
the number of houses and flats built to let but more freedom must be given to
the private builder. In a property-owning democracy, the more people who
own their homes the better.

In Education and in Health some of the most crying needs are not being met.
For the money now being spent we will provide better services and so fulfil
the high hopes we all held when we planned the improvements during the
war.

The whole system of town planning and development charges needs drastic
overhaul.

We shall review the position of pensioners, including war pensioners, and
see that the hardest needs are met first. The care and comfort of the elderly is
a sacred trust. Some of them prefer to remain at work and there must be
encouragement for them to do so.

To obtain more food practical knowledge and business experience must be
released to comb the world for greater supplies.

We shall maintain our system of guaranteed agricultural prices and markets
and protect British horticulture from foreign dumpers. We have untilled
acres and much marginal land. Farmers and merchants should work together
to improve distribution in the interests of the public.

Subject to the needs of Rearmament, the utmost will be done to provide
better housing, water supplies, and drainage, electricity and transport in rural
areas.

The fishing industry will be protected from unrestricted foreign dumping.
Every effort will be made by international agreement to prevent over-fishing.

Food subsidies cannot be radically changed in present circumstances, but
later we hope to simplify the system and by increases in family allowances,
taxation changes and other methods, to ensure that public money is spent on
those who need help and not, as at present, upon all classes indiscriminately.

Apart from proposals to help Britain to stand on her own feet by increasing
productivity, we must guard the British way of life, hallowed by centuries of
tradition. We have fought tyrants at home and abroad to win and preserve the
institutions of constitutional Monarchy and Parliamentary government. From
Britain across the generations our message has gone forth to all parts of the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1951/1951-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 6

1951 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

globe. However well-meaning many of the present Socialist leaders may be,
there is no doubt that in its complete development a Socialist State,
monopolising production, distribution and exchange, would be fatal to
individual freedom. We look on the Government as the servant and not as
the masters of the people. Multiplying orders and rules should be reduced,
and the whole system kept under more rigorous Parliamentary scrutiny. We
shall call an all-Party conference to consider proposals for the reform of the
House of Lords.

We shall restore the University constituencies, which have been
disfranchised contrary to the agreement reached by all three Parties during
the war.

The United Kingdom cannot he kept in a Whitehall straitjacket. The
Unionist policy for Scotland, including the practical steps proposed for
effective Scottish control of Scottish affairs, will he vigorously pressed
forward.

There will he a Cabinet Minister charged with the care of Welsh affairs,

We shall seek to restore to Local Government the confidence and
responsibility it has lost under Socialism.

All these and other issues of the day can only he stated briefly in our Party
Manifesto. A much fuller account will he given of them in Britain Strong
and Free which will he published in a few days.

I close with a simple declaration of our faith. The Conservative and Unionist
Party stands not for any section of the people but for all. In this spirit, we
will do our utmost to grapple with the increasing difficulties into which our
country has been plunged.

1950 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

This is the Road: The Conservative and
Unionist Party's Policy

As Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party I submit this manifesto of
our beliefs and policy to the British electors.

All who cherish the cause of our country at this fateful moment must cast
their vote after hard and long thought, and make sure they cast it effectively.

I commend to your attention with confidence this outline of our resolves and
desires should we be called upon to assume the responsibilities of
Government.

19 January, 1950
Winston S. Churchill

The policy of the Conservative Party, expressed in ""The Right Road for
Britain"" is to restore to our country her economic independence and to our
citizens their full personal freedom and power of initiative. Unless Britain
can hold her place in the world, she cannot make her full contribution to the
preservation of peace, and peace is our supreme purpose. Britain, wisely led,
can bring together the Commonwealth and Empire, Western Europe and the
Atlantic Powers into a partnership dedicated to the cause of saving world
peace and of preserving democratic freedom and the rule of law.

Present Dangers

We can only import the food and raw materials on which we depend by
paying for them in goods, services or cash. For the first few years after the
war every country wanted all that Britain could make, almost regardless of
price. That time is passing. Now Britain can sell abroad only if her goods are
high in quality and competitive in price.

Since 1945, Britain has received in gifts and loans from the United States
and the nations of the Commonwealth the vast sum of nearly £2,000
millions. But Marshall aid will end by 1952. From that time forth we must
pay for all we buy from overseas or suffer the consequences in low standards
of living and high unemployment.

The duty of the Government from their first day in office was to husband the

national resources, to evoke the greatest efforts from all, to give every
chance to enterprise and inventiveness and above all, not needlessly to
divide the nation.

The Socialist Failure

But the Socialists have failed in their duty. National resources have been
squandered. Individual effort has been discouraged or suppressed. National
unity has been deeply injured. The Government have shrunk from the
realities of the situation and have not told the people the truth.

The Socialist Deception

From the time they acquired power they pretended that their policy was
bringing the prosperity they had promised. They tried to make out that
before they got a majority the whole history of Great Britain, so long
admired and envied throughout the world, was dark and dismal. They spread
the tale that social welfare is something to be had from the State free, gratis
and for nothing. They have put more money into circulation, but it has
bought less and less. The value of every pound earned or saved or paid in
pensions or social services has been cut by 3s. 8d. since they took office. It is
not a£ but 16/4.

There is no foundation for the Socialist claim to have brought us prosperity
and security. Ministers themselves have declared that but for American Aid
there would have been two million people unemployed.

During these bleak years Britain has lurched from crisis to crisis and from
makeshift to makeshift. Whatever temporary expedients have been used to
create a false sense of well being, none has effected a permanent cure.
Devaluation is not the last crisis nor have we seen the worst of it yet.

Socialist Mismanagement

In 1945, the Socialists promised that their methods of planning and
nationalisation would make the people of Britain masters of their economic
destiny. Nothing could be more untrue. Every forecast has proved grossly
over-optimistic. Every crisis has caught them unawares. The Fuel Crisis cost
the country £200 millions and the Convertibility Crisis as much. Ambitious
plans have gone awry. Nearly thirty million pounds have already been
muddled away on the Groundnuts Scheme. Railway engines were converted
to burn oil because coal was scarce and then converted back again because
oil was even scarcer. With the same labour force as before the war little more
than half as many houses are being built. Despite the promise of the Minister
of Health that ""when the next Election occurs there will be no housing
problem in Great Britain for the working class"", waiting lists for council
houses in many districts are longer now than they were five years ago.

Socialism has imposed a crushing burden of taxation amounting to eight
shillings of every pound earned in this country. Enterprise and extra effort

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1950/1950-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 19

1950 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

have been stifled. Success has been penalised. Thrift and savings have been
discouraged. A vote for Socialism is a vote to continue the policy which has
endangered our economic and present independence both as a nation and as
men and women.

The Conservatives and Your Future

A complete change in the spirit of administration is needed. Only the
Conservative Party can make this change. The Socialist Government are
temporising with grave economic perils. Britain's difficulties will not be
resolved by some trick of organisation, nor will prosperity come as a gift
from government. The nation will enjoy in benefit only as much as it is
prepared to create by its own effort. With a high spirit, through great
endeavours, relying on our native skill, every man and woman must bend
their energies to a new wave of national impulse. Only thus can the British
people save themselves now and win lasting prosperity for the future. In the
last four years the British people have not been shown the way nor given a
proper chance to find it. A Conservative Government will guide them along
the right road.

The Economic Crisis

Empire Conference

Britain can resolve her economic difficulties not only by reviving her native
strength but by fortifying every link with the nations of our Empire and
Commonwealth.

An Imperial Economic Conference should consider the whole problem of
strengthening the resources of the Empire in order to close the dollar gap.
This will speed the development of raw materials and foodstuffs. It will
promote greater exports of raw materials and manufactured goods to dollar
countries. It will seek to encourage the investment of American as well as
British capital in the Empire. It will try to reach a permanent settlement of
the debts owed by Commonwealth nations to one another, and especially the
war-time debts incurred by Britain for defending India and Egypt.

We must rebuild the reserves of the sterling area, of which we are the

principal guardians and with our partners enlarge the area of trade over
which free exchange prevails.

Enterprise

Britain's own contribution must take the form of larger and more efficient
production at lower prices.

Conservatives believe in enterprise. We believe that the quality of daring
was never more needed than today. It deserves practical encouragement

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1950/1950-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 19

1950 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

wherever it is to be found. Only by its exercise can mass unemployment be
averted and prosperity attained.

The true value of money must be honestly maintained. The crushing burden
of public expenditure must be drastically reduced. Stronger effort, more
enterprise and inventiveness, and greater thrift can only be encouraged by
lower taxes.

Government Expenditure

In order to lower taxes and the high cost of living we must cut down
Government spending. We are convinced that substantial savings are
necessary and possible. If a tenth or even a twentieth of our enormous
national expenditure of three thousand three hundred millions a year were
saved, our whole financial position would be relieved, and immediate
reductions in taxation could be shared by all. We do not ignore the
unpopularity of any kind of saving and the misrepresentation to which it will
be subjected, but the task must be faced, and we shall not shirk it.

Cost of Defence

An immediate survey of the whole seven hundred and fifty millions of
defence expenditure is imperative.

Cost of Food

The time has come to restore the business of food purchase to the
experienced traders in food and to end direct Government buying. If the
experience of other countries is any guide, this change will certainly effect
some reduction in the cost of our food. Meanwhile the production of food is
rising in many lands, and thus it should be possible to reduce the number of
commodities for which rationing remains necessary. Our Conservative
policy is clear: to reduce the cost to the taxpayer by the wise buying of food.

The present system of food subsidies is open to the objection that it is
indiscriminate in its incidence. Those who need it least get as much as those
who need it most. As Mr. Eden said in the House of Commons, our principle
should be ""that the strong should help the weak and we should not try to aid
everybody indiscriminately"".

In any approach to the problem of food subsidies, made necessary by the
urgent need to improve the purchasing power of the £, we shall be bound by
this pledge. There will be no reduction which might influence the price of
food without compensating increases to those most affected. These
compensations will take the form, on the one hand, of larger family
allowances, pensions and other social benefits, and, on the other, of
reductions of taxation, direct and indirect, that will increase incentives
among the masses of the people.

1950 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

Waste and Extravagance

Everyone knows that there is enormous waste. There are too many Ministers
and Government Departments and there is too much overlapping of
functions between them. For example, the work of the Ministry of Civil
Aviation should be redistributed between the Transport and other ministries
so that a separate Department ceases to exist. The civilian functions of the
Ministry of Supply such as state trading in metals, will cease; and others
should go to the Board of Trade. The Service Departments should buy their
common needs through a joint organisation under the Minister of Defence in
order to achieve the most efficient and economical arrangement. Many new
Commissions or Committees outside the Ministries must be reviewed to see
if they are wanted. There is also plenty of scope for retrenchment - to give
only a few examples - in public relations, Information Services, excessive
control over local authorities, the county agricultural committees,
Government travelling, etc.

In local government we favour more devolution to the boroughs and district
councils to avoid the swarms of full-time organisers and supervisors like
those who have sprung up in the health services. The cost of hospital
administration could be reduced by new methods of financial control
including better costing and more publicity for accounts.

Lower Taxes

We regard present high taxation as a grave evil. By reductions in expenditure
substantial sums will be available for reducing both direct and indirect
taxation. As we have already said our aim and intention is to make sure that
extra work, effort and skill on piece-rates and through overtime, instead of
being penalised, shall gain their just reward. The restoration of their
incentive, not only to the higher ranks of labour will give a new stimulus to
every kind of production and help our export trade. The high taxation of
money put to reserve in business hinders many important schemes for
improving industrial efficiency. We hope to make sufficient economies to
start upon reducing indirect taxation and particularly Purchase Tax on
necessities and semi-necessities. Under the present system any reduction of
purchase tax entails considerable losses to retailers. This we shall avoid. All
reductions in taxation will encourage National Savings.

Unemployment

The Socialists claim that their policy has prevented mass unemployment
such as followed the first World War. The conditions often were wholly
different. Under the Socialist Government of 1929-1931 unemployment rose
violently and reached fearful figures. With all this in our minds our war-time
Coalition anxiously probed the future, and all the leading Socialist ministers,
including Mr. Attlee, Mr. Herbert Morrison, Sir Stafford Cripps and Mr.
Bevin, agreed with their Conservative colleagues that the world demand for
goods would, for some years after the fighting stopped, make serious

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1950/1950-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 19

1950 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

unemployment unlikely. However, we made far-reaching plans, based upon
hard experience and new knowledge, to cope with the evil should it come.
All this is upon record and was laid before Parliament in 1944. But in
addition we have had nearly £2,000 millions given or loaned to us by the
United States and Commonwealth countries. Do not forget that Mr.
Morrison, Mr. Bevan and other leading Socialists have declared that without
this aid we should have had 1% to 2 millions unemployed in these last years
instead of the present 300,000.

These are strange confessions for public men to make at a time when they
are boasting that they have cured unemployment. Stranger still is the charge
they make that their Conservative colleagues, with whom they agreed the
policy of 1944, actually seek to provoke unemployment in order to get more
work out of the wage earners. This is indeed rather shabby. We regard the
maintenance of full employment as the first aim of a Conservative
Government. How grave will be the consequences of the cessation of
American Aid no one can forecast. But if human endeavour can avail we
shall succeed.

Post-War Credits

We recognise that the repayment of post-war credits is an obligation to be
met. Such large sums are however outstanding that it will be impossible to
repay them all at once without risk of inflation. Meanwhile we shall consider
schemes for the repayment of credits to the estates of deceased persons.

Equal Pay

We hope that during the life of the next Parliament the country's financial
position will improve sufficiently to enable us to proceed at an early date
with the application in the Government Service of the principle of equal pay
for men and women for services of equal value.

British Industry

The Conservative Party will encourage in industry the highest level of
efficient production and the most effective partnership between owners,
executives and operatives. To day all forms of production and distribution
are hampered in a Socialist atmosphere which denies enterprise its reward
while making life too easy for the laggards. Monopoly and bureaucracy
should give place to competition and enterprise. All enterprises, large and
small, should have a fair field.

We shall do everything to help the trade unions to serve the best interests of
the nation and their members. The foundation of industrial endeavour must
be good human relationships, not impersonal control from aloft and afar. For
all those engaged in production we shall provide opportunity, freedom and a
fair share of the proceeds, and for the consumer greater variety of choice at

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1950/1950-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 19

1950 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

prices to suit his pocket.

Power Should be More Decentralised

On every hand, in local as well as in national affairs, power is being
increasingly centred in the Government. The State has obtruded heavily on
the individual, his home and his pocket. Almost every incident of daily life
is bound by controls which Parliament has had little chance to debate. These
controls shelter the sluggish from failure while holding back the adventurous
from success. They permit easy profits without insisting on efficiency. They
create monopoly and deprive the consumer of the correction of competition.

Britain already knows to her cost that the state monopolies created by
nationalisation are rigid, awkward, wasteful and inefficient. Large losses
have been made. Monopoly powers are being used to force higher prices on
the consumers, who have no effective redress. Responsible initiative is
crushed by centralised authority. Frustration and cynicism prevail among the
staffs. The power of trade unions to protect their members is being
undermined and the freedom of choice of consumer and worker alike is
being narrowed. If nationalisation is extended, the creeping paralysis of state
monopoly will spread over ever wider sections of industry until the
Socialists have carried out their declared aim to nationalise all the means of
production, distribution and exchange.

Nationalisation

We shall bring Nationalisation to a full stop here and now. Thereby we shall
save all those industries, such as cement, sugar, meat distribution, chemicals,
water and insurance which are now under threat by the Socialists.

We shall repeal the Iron and Steel Act before it can come into force. Steel
will remain under free enterprise, but its policy on prices and development
will be supervised as in recent years by a Board representative of
Government, management, labour and consumers.

The nationalisation of omnibuses and tramways will be halted. Wherever
possible those already nationalised will be offered to their former owners,
whether private or municipal. We shall also be prepared to sell back to free
enterprise those sections of the road haulage industry which have been
nationalised, and to restore the former system of A and B licences. The
limitation of distance on private road hauliers will be progressively
eliminated. The present freedom of C licences will remain untouched.

As wide a measure of free enterprise as possible should be restored to Civil
Aviation. We shall review the structure and character of the Airways

Corporations with that in mind.

We shall drastically reorganise the Coal Industry as a public undertaking by
restricting the duties of the National Board and by giving autonomy to the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1950/1950-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 19

1950 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

Area Boards. By decentralising the work of the National Board we shall give
greater responsibility to the men on the spot and revive local loyalties and
enthusiasm. ""British Railways"" should be re-organised into a number of
regional railway systems each with its own pride of identity and each
administered by its own Board of Direction whose members must have
varied practical experience of serving public needs. We shall hold ourselves
free to decide the future of the Gas and Electricity Boards when we have had
more experience of their working.

The consumer must be given greater protection in the industries remaining
nationalised. This can be done by a wider use of independent price tribunals,
by stricter Parliamentary control of accounts, by finding time for a periodic
review of each industry by Parliament and by subjecting them to
examination by the Monopolies Commission or some similar body.
Ministers' powers to make appointments will be defined and their powers to
give directions will be clarified. Every nationalised undertaking will observe
the Workers' Charter.

Our special proposals for nationalised undertakings in Scotland are set out
later.

Controls

The time has come when controls must be reduced to the minimum
necessary as the supply situation improves. Controlled prices should be
based on the costs of the more efficient firms and the system of allocating
materials put on an up-to-date basis. This will make it easier for new firms to
start.

Almost all our neighbours in Europe have ended food, and indeed petrol,
rationing. As soon as we have been able to ensure that the prime necessities
of life are within the reach of every family and each individual, we shall
abolish the existing rationing system.

Monopoly

Through the powers of the Monopoly and Restrictive Practices Act we shall
see that the public interest is protected and that prices are not kept up either
by inefficiency or by combinations in restraint of trade. We shall bring to the
front the question of restrictive labour practices which the National Joint
Advisory Committee has had under consideration.

Bulk Purchase

It will be our policy to end bulk buying by the State. But we shall honour
existing contracts and be prepared, where necessary, to give suitable
guarantees for producers in Empire and Commonwealth countries. Wherever
conditions permit, we shall reopen the commodity markets which can be a

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1950/1950-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 19

1950 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

valuable source of foreign currency. The Liverpool Cotton Exchange will be
reopened.

Trade Unions

We have held the views, from the days of Disraeli, that the Trade Union
movement is essential to the proper working of our economy and of our
industrial life. Conservatives should not hesitate to join Trade Unions as so
many of our Party have already done, and to play their full part in their
union affairs. As soon as possible we wish the Trade Unions to regain their
function of obtaining for their members a full share of increasing
productivity through free collective bargaining. We shall consult with all
engaged in industry on how to make more effective the machinery for
consultation between industry and the Government.

We shall abolish the direction of labour.

We shall consult with the Unions upon a friendly and final settlement of the
questions of contracting out and compulsory unionism, on both of which
Conservatives have strong convictions of principle, and on any other matters
that the Unions may wish to raise.

Workers' Charter

The detailed application of a Workers' Charter designed to give security,
incentive and status will be discussed with the Trade Unions and the
employers. It is our intention to bring it into effect as early as possible in
industry and to extend it to agriculture wherever practicable. Legislation will
provide every employee with a legal right to a written contract of service in
which, if both parties agree, length of notice may be adjusted to length of
service.

The Workers’ Charter will lay down the principle that extra effort should
always bring extra reward and that promotion shall be by merit. It will
encourage schemes of training, both technical and general, for all who may
benefit from them. It advocates the widest possible extension, on a voluntary
basis, of joint consultation on subjects other than wages and conditions of
work, which are already covered by collective bargaining, and will favour
schemes of co-partnership and profit-sharing. The main body of the Charter
will not be embodied in legislation but will be drawn up as a Code of
Conduct and submitted to Parliament for debate and adoption. We shall
ensure that this Code is strictly applied in all undertakings under
Government control. After due notice has been given only those employers
who observe the Code will obtain public contracts.

Food and Agriculture

Home food production must have an assured place in the national economy.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1950/1950-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 19

1950 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

We must look to the home farmer and market gardener for a greater quantity
and more variety in the nation's food and they will have first place in the
home market. We are opposed to the nationalisation of the land and farming
by the State.

British agriculture is expected to provide, on a long-term basis, an efficient
output at least half as large again as that of pre-war. It should concentrate
more than at present on live stock and so help to increase the meat ration.

We shall encourage the fishing industry to set up a White Fish Marketing
Board. Renewed efforts will be made to secure an international agreement to
stop serious over-fishing.

For farm produce we shall continue the system, which we introduced during
the war, of guaranteed prices based upon an annual price review. Wool
should be given a guaranteed price and oats the same treatment as other
guaranteed products.

Farmers and merchants must be encouraged to work together through
Marketing Boards and voluntary associations, while the consumer is
protected by the Monopolies Commission and special committees of
investigation. Loans to aid in financing new production will be made
available through co-operative associations and Marketing Boards. British
horticulture must be safeguarded against destructive imports. Small growers
in the industry should be encouraged to develop grading and co-operative
buying and selling organisations.

We shall vigorously implement the Hill Farming Act and give appropriate
incentives to farmers of marginal land.

The duties of the County Committees should be re-examined and their
administration and excessive paper work simplified. Ministers should seek
their advice on every problem of production and the use of agricultural land.
The Advisory Service must give impartial advice and inspire the trust of
farmers. It must be freed from bureaucracy and enabled to attract the best
advisers. If necessary, the Universities should be asked to help.

The Ministries of Agriculture and Food must be brought closer together and
the present overlapping and conflict eliminated, with a view to their eventual
amalgamation. The supply of food from home and overseas supplies must be
kept under constant review by a revived Market Supply Committee.

Nationalisation will not reduce the costs of food. Past experience shows that
it will increase them. We shall make it our business to see that the housewife

gets her food through the cheapest and most efficient channels and that she
has first chance of any extra supplies that can be got.

Rural Conditions

Houses for the agricultural population must have the necessary priority and
subsidies will be given to local authorities and individuals alike.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1950/1950-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 19

1950 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

Reconditioning grants will be made available for all rural cottages. As
supplies of materials improve, reconditioning will be made compulsory.

Local schemes for water supplies and sewerage should be given the highest
priority and administrative delays in the work should be attacked. The
countryside deserves its fair share of other modern amenities such as
electricity and buses.

Suitable educational facilities will be provided by retaining as many village
schools as possible, by teaching rural science in all primary and secondary
schools, rural and urban, and by providing adequate facilities for technical
education, and grants for village halls. It has always been part of our policy
to foster the smallholdings movement. We shall make suitable financial
arrangements to encourage small-holders to buy farms.

Land Use

Where land is to be chosen for building or for the use of the Fighting
Services we shall see that the over-riding test between alternative sites is
their capacity for agricultural production.

Forestry

The Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State for Scotland should
have full responsibility for the Forestry Commission.

Social Security

The Social Services were born of Parliaments with Conservative and Liberal
majorities. They rest upon the productive effort of British industry and
agriculture. The Socialists have by inflation reduced their value and
compromised their future. By energetic action they can be saved and their
value maintained. Britain can only enjoy the social services for which she is
prepared to work.

We are determined to give a solid base of social security below which none
shall fall and above which each must be encouraged to rise to the utmost
limit of his ability. We shall encourage instead of penalising those who wish
to create from their own efforts more security for themselves and their
families. We shall foster the ancient virtue of personal thrift.

Property-Owning Democracy

We intend to help all those who wish to own a house of their own or a small
holding. A true property-owning democracy must be based upon the wide
distribution of private property, not upon its absorption in the State machine.

Housing

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1950/1950-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 19

1950 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

Upon good housing depends the health and happiness of every family.
Before the war, under free enterprise with a Conservative government, the
nation was getting a thousand new houses every day. The latest Socialist
target is five hundred. In fact, the cuts caused by the devaluation of the
pound have now reduced the Housing Programme to a figure which will
result in 30,000 fewer houses a year than were built in 1931 at the height of
the world economic crisis. Moreover, house building is now costing three
times as much as it did before the war. We cannot believe that this is the last
word in modern planning.

We shall revive the confidence of the Building Industry and greatly widen
the scope for the independent builder. The restrictive licensing system as it
applies to house building should be removed, but a limit on the size of
houses should be kept. Every assistance and encouragement will be given to
the Building Societies.

In order to further our aim to help all those who wish to have a house of their
own, local authorities will be stimulated to make full use of the Housing and
Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts. Only 5 per cent. deposit in cash should
be required for the purchase of a house. Certain extra costs like the recently
doubled stamp duty should be abolished. Supplies of timber are vital to the
whole programme. We intend to abolish the bulk buying of timber.

Houses to Rent

Local authorities must continue to play their full part in providing a wide
variety of houses and flats for families of every size including smaller
dwellings for elderly people. We look to local authorities particularly to be
the spearhead of the attack on overcrowding and the slums which we shall
resume as soon as possible. Where houses are built with the aid of public
funds or public credit, the necessary arrangements will be made to ensure the
appropriate standards.

Liberated and if need be encouraged private enterprise can be relied upon to
meet part of the need for houses to rent if, among future tax reliefs,
consideration is given to depreciation allowances for owners of new houses
to rent. Modernisation can be encouraged be a more generous system of
licensing and by granting tax allowances to cover the cost of conversion.

Rent control must continue until there is no housing shortage at any given
level. We shall keep the matter under review.

Town and Country Planning

We shall drastically change the 1947 Act. It has been shown by experience
to have all the defects forecast by Conservatives in debate in Parliament. The
present machinery is much too cumbersome, too rigid and too slow. Bad
planning and wrong use of land must, of course, be avoided. Bur we must be
careful that in seeking to control minor development we do not distract
attention from the main structure of the development plans. We shall en

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1950/1950-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 19

1950 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

courage more elasticity and informal consultation. The high level of the
development charge and the uncertainty of its application hamper
development. The amount of the charge seems to be often decided by
bargaining and not on principle. The incidence of the charge must be
reviewed. Any such levy must be fair to all and should be at such a rate that
suitable development is not discouraged. We shall also provide an appeal
against assessments.

Education

Our main objective will be to bring into operation the reforms set out in our
Education Act of 1944. As was originally stated, the whole Act will take a
generation to implement. Everything cannot be carried out at once.

Within the existing framework of the Act it will be necessary to discuss with
local education authorities and with the Denominations the timetable of the
development plans, so that all who take decisions about the future of
particular schools may do so with a clear idea as to the date and the
circumstances in which their various responsibilities will have to be
undertaken. Where necessary we intend to adopt simpler standards for
school building. This will help the voluntary schools.

A determined effort must be made to reduce the size of classes particularly
in the primary schools. There is grave danger of education losing its
meaning if what is happening in some areas is allowed to continue. We must
be free to meet this challenge with fresh minds and active policies.

The division of all-age schools into primary and secondary must be pressed
forward. We attach special importance to retaining the traditions and,
wherever possible, the corporate life of the grammar schools. Every effort
should be made to help parents to send their children to schools of their own
choice. The status of technical schools and colleges must be enhanced and
their numbers increased. We wish to see that the rewards of the teaching
profession are such as will continuously attract men and women of high
quality.

The Health Service

We pledge ourselves to maintain and improve the Health Service. Every year
the Estimates laid before Parliament have been greatly exceeded.
Administrative efficiency and economy and correct priorities throughout the
whole service must be assured, so that a proper balance is maintained and
the hardest needs are met first. In particular the balance of the dental service
should be restored so that children and mothers receive attention.

We intend to strengthen the position of the family doctor by restoring his
freedom to practise anywhere and by offering a weighted capitation fee to
doctors with small lists, especially in rural areas. Appeals against dismissal
should be allowed to go to the Courts instead of to the Minister.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1950/1950-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 19

1950 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

The functions and methods of appointment of Boards of management and
area hospital boards require a more satisfactory basis. All hospitals within
the health scheme should by statute admit the acutely sick, subject to proper
safeguards. In capital expenditure priority will be given to the re-opening of
beds and improving the conditions of the nursing staff.

Pensions
War Pensions

War pensions have been affected by the reduced purchasing power of
money. We shall set up a Select Committee to see what improvements
should be made, having regard to national resources.

Contributory and Non-Contributory Pensions

There are a number of improvements which ought to be made:

e An increase in the limit of weekly earnings without reduction of
pensions from 30s. to 45s. in the case of widows with children and
20s. to 30s. for women pensioners with dependants.

¢ Assessment of casual earnings of old age pensioners on a monthly
instead of a weekly basis.

¢ Revision of the assumed rates of interest on capital saved by
applicants for non-contributory pensions.

Working Pensioners

In order to assist those who desire to prolong their working days and thus aid
our production effort, a prime aim of our policy will be to provide an
optional pension of 10s. a week at the age of 65 for a man and 60 for a
woman without a retirement condition and without payment of
contributions, other than for industrial injuries if employed, for persons
insured for at least five years prior to Sth July, 1948. When they retire, or at
the age of 70 for a man and 65 for a woman, they would revert to the normal
pension of 26s. a week without any addition for their employment during the
previous five years.

Britain and the World

The Socialist Government has failed to make good its claim at the last
election that Socialism alone could reach a good understanding with Soviet
Russia. ""Left would speak to left,"" they said; but in fact today East and West
are separated by an Iron Curtain. Socialism abroad has been proved to be the
weakest obstacle to Communism and in many countries of Eastern Europe
has gone down before it. We are not prepared to regard those ancient states
and nations which have already fallen beneath the Soviet yoke as lost for
ever.

In China 500 million people have been subjected to Communist dictatorship,
and in the new countries of South Eastern Asia free democracyis under
heavy Communist pressure.

Too often in the last four years Britain has followed when she should have
led. A Conservative Government will go forward resolutely to build, within
the framework of the United Nations, a system of freedom based upon the
tule of law. For this Britain must continue in ever closer association with
Western Europe and the United States. But in the fore-front of British
statesmanship stands the vital task of extending the unity, strength and
progress of the British Empire and Commonwealth.

The British Empire and Commonwealth

We pledge ourselves to give our active support to all measures to promote
the welfare of the British Empire and Commonwealth. We shall do all in our
power to develop the new relationships in the Commonwealth with India,
Pakistan and Ceylon. The more frequent the meetings between principal
ministers from the countries of the Commonwealth the better, and the views
of our partners on the desirability of setting up a permanent civil liaison staff
will be sought. All Empire and Commonwealth Governments must review
the entire field of Imperial defence and discuss together the need for a
common advisory Defence Council and a combined staff so as to work
together for the standardisation of equipment and methods of training.

We shall welcome and aid the steady flow of United Kingdom citizens to
Common wealth countries provided that it includes a fair cross section of
our population by age and occupation. The greatest possible development of
Empire trade is our aim. We offer Empire producers a place in the United
Kingdom market second only to the home producer. We claim the right to
maintain whatever preferences or other special arrangements may be
necessary. We shall be prepared to offer a guaranteed market at a
remunerative price for some colonial products, and to concert plans with
Commonwealth countries for the long term expansion of production of food
and raw materials. Both British and American investment in the Colonies
must be fostered under suitable conditions, in order to develop colonial
territories to the advantage of all.

Foreign Affairs

We adhere to the ideals set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, and
will sustain all agencies designed to promote the social and economic
welfare of the peoples of the world.

Hand in hand with France and other friendly powers we shall pursue the aim
of closer unity in Europe. The admission of the Government of Western
Germany into the Council of Europe will be supported on the understanding
that she accepts freely and fully the Western democratic conception of
human rights. Among future tasks is the need to make an Austrian Treaty on

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1950/1950-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 15 of 19

1950 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

terms which will safeguard Austrian independence and provide for the
withdrawal of Russian forces simultaneously with those of the Western
Powers.

Above all we seek to work in fraternal association with the United States to
help by all means all countries, in Europe, Asia or elsewhere, to resist the
aggression of Communism by open attack or secret penetration.

Defence

Until the challenge to the authority of the United Nations is ended, we affirm
the principle of national service. We believe that by wise arrangements its
burden may be sensibly reduced without our fighting power being
diminished. The reconstitution of the Regular Army will require pay and
conditions of service which conform more closely with the standards of civil
life. Recruiting for the Auxiliary Forces demands better conditions,
accommodation and amenities. We are sure we can get better value for the
vast sums of money now being spent.

The United Kingdom

Conservatives recognise that both Scotland and Wales have justifiable
grievances against the immensely increased control of their affairs from
London. Centralised control which ignores national characteristics is an
essential part of Socialism. Until the Socialist Government is removed
neither Scotland nor Wales will be able to strike away the fetters of
centralisation and be free to develop their own way of life.

Scotland

A new Minister of State for Scotland, with Cabinet rank, will act as deputy
to the Secretary of State and in order to secure a proper distribution of
departmental duties an additional Under-Secretary will be appointed. The
whole situation as between Scotland and England in the light of modern
developments requires a review by a Royal Commission and this we propose
to appoint.

For coal, electricity and railways there should be separate Scottish Boards,
which will act in concert with the English Boards but in no way subordinate
to them. We also propose a Scottish Gas Commission, responsible to the
Secretary of State, to return wherever practicable and desired, the
undertakings to local authorities either singly or jointly.

The status of the heads of United Kingdom Departments in Scotland should
be enhanced The powers of local councils must be maintained and
strengthened and the supervision of the Secretary of State over them
reduced. Wherever Scottish law and Scottish conditions on matters needing
legislation differ materially from those in England and Wales, separate
Scottish Bills based on conditions in Scotland ought to be promoted.

1950 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

Wales

A special responsibility for Wales should be assigned to a member of the
Cabinet.

A strong and diversified industrial structure founded upon mining, iron and
steel must

form the basis of her future economic security. We must continue to develop
a suitable range of light industries. Such local industries as quarrying must
be encouraged.

Wales will benefit from our policies for hill farming, the more intensive use
of marginal land and the other proposals stated in our policy for Wales.

Since the passing of the Welsh Intermediate Act, Welsh education has
marched steadily forward giving an example to the whole of the United
Kingdom, especially in the secondary sphere. Similar progress is to be
observed in facilities for higher technical education in the Principality. We
shall make it our special care to foster Welsh culture and the Welsh
language.

Northern Ireland

We renew our pledge of faith which all parties have made, to Northern
Ireland. We shall not allow her position as an integral part of the United
Kingdom and of the Empire to be altered in the slightest degree without the
consent of the Northern Ireland Parliament.

The Constitution

Conservatives believe in the Constitution as a safeguard of liberty. Socialists
believe that it should be used for Party ends. They have brought in measures
for changing the constitution of the House of Commons which directly
violated the all-Party agreement reached by the Speaker's Conference and
were designed to give advantage to their own Party. With out mandate and
without good reason they have reduced the powers of the House of Lords
and taken the country a long way towards single chamber government. By
over-centralisation of power they have gravely weakened our system of
democratic local government.

Conservatives are determined to restore our democratic institutions to their
former traditions and to their rightful place above party.

House of Lords
It would be our aim to reach a reform and final settlement of the constitution

and powers of the House of Lords by means of an all-Party conference
called at an appropriate date. It would have before it proposals that:-

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1950/1950-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 19

1950 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

¢ (a) the present right to attend and vote based solely on heredity should
not by itself constitute a qualification for admission to a reformed
House;

¢ (b) areformed House of Lords should have powers appropriate to its
constitution, but not exceeding those conferred by the Act of 1911.

House of Commons

The Socialist Party has violated the tradition in that changes in the
composition of the House should be made only in accordance with the report
of an all-Party conference presided over by the Speaker. To repair this
breach of faith, we shall restore, as we have already declared in Parliament,
the University constituencies, holding elections immediately after the
necessary legislation has been passed.

Local Government

It is our aim to restore adequate confidence and responsibility to local
government. To that end in consultation with local authorities of all kinds,
functions and financial arrangements (including all Government grants) must
be reviewed and overhauled. We wish to restore functions to the smaller
authorities when reorganised, particularly the personal health services.

Our Purpose

In all that we strive to do we shall seek to serve the nation as a whole
without fear or favour or subservience to the interests of one class or party.

We intend to free the productive energies of the nation from the trammels of
overbearing state control and bureaucratic management. To denationalise
wherever practicable, to decentralise as much as possible, to encourage and
reward personal responsibility, to give enterprise and adventure their heads:
these are the principles on which a Conservative Government will act.
Throughout the whole of industry we intend to foster a growing spirit of
unity for a common purpose.

National Unity

By partisan measures and factious abuse, the nation has been deeply divided
in the last five years. A Conservative Government will set itself the task of
bringing the people of Britain together once again. We shall act not for a
section but for the nation. We shall not be the masters of the people but their
servants. The Conservative aim is not enviously to suppress success, but to
release energy and enterprise: not maliciously to sow distrust, but to create
unity; not to pursue a doctrinaire and ill-considered theory, but to enable the
British people to lead their traditional way of life.

Britain of The Future

1950 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:41

We shall make Britain once again a place in which hard work, thrift, honesty
and neighbourliness are honoured and win their true reward in wide freedom
undermeath the law. Reverence for Christian ethics, self-respect, pride in skill
and responsibility, love of home and family, devotion to our country and the
British Empire and Commonwealth, are the pillars upon which we base our
faith.

1945 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

Winston Churchill's Declaration of Policy to the
Electors

I had hoped to preserve the Coalition Government, comprising all Parties in
the State, until the end of the Japanese war, but owing to the unwillingness
of the Socialist and Sinclair Liberal Parties to agree to my proposal, a
General Election became inevitable, and I have formed a new National
Government, consisting of the best men in all Parties who were willing to
serve and some who are members of no Party at all.

It is a strong Government, containing many of those who helped me to carry
the burdens of State through the darkest days and on whose counsel and
executive ability I have learned to rely.

We seek the good of the whole nation, not that of one section or one faction.
We believe in the living unity of the British people, which transcends class
or party differences. It was this living unity which enabled us to stand like a
rock against Germany when she over-ran Europe. Upon our power to retain
unity, the future of this country and of the whole world largely depends.

Britain is still at war, and must not turn aside from the vast further efforts
still needed to bring Japan to the same end as Germany. Even when all
foreign enemies are utterly defeated, that will not be the end of our task. It
will be the beginning of our further opportunity - the opportunity which we
snatched out of the jaws of disaster in 1940 - to save the world from tyranny
and then to play our part in its wise, helpful guidance.

Having poured out all we have to beat the Germans, holding nothing back,
we must now take stock of our resources and plan how the energies of the
British people can best be freed for the work that lies ahead.

This is the time for freeing energies, not stifling them. Britain's greatness has
been built on character and daring, not on docility to a State machine. At all

costs we must preserve that spirit of independence and that ""Right to live by
no man's leave underneath the law"".

Britain and the World

The settlement of Europe and the prosecution of the war against Japan
depend on decisions of the utmost gravity, which can only be taken by

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1945/1945-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 14

1945 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

resolute and experienced men. Our alliance with Soviet Russia and our
intimate friendship with the U.S.A. can be maintained only if we show that
our candour is matched by our strength.

We have, during the years of our history, gained the confidence of the
smaller nations, because, although our power has been formidable, we have
tried to use it with restraint and for high purpose, and have always respected
the rights and interests of others. There is no small country which does not
welcome our strength. This was plainly shown in the recent events in
Greece. The irresponsible attitude towards the interests of the Greek people
adopted by many sections of Left Wing opinion is, by its example, a warning
not to put the conduct of foreign affairs into untried hands.

The main hope of the world is now founded upon the setting up of a World
Organisation strong enough to prevent future wars of aggression whether by
the weak or the strong. The United Nations have lately been assembled at
San Francisco with the object of devising the necessary machinery. We have
taken our full part with other Nations and have acted by natural inclination
in full agreement with the United States.

There are still many difficulties to overcome. It would be wrong to pretend
that so far full success has been gained. Despair would be a crime. We must
persevere by any road that opens towards the uplands on which will
certainly be built the calm temples of peace. Our prevailing hope is that the
foundations will be laid on the indissoluble agreement of Great Britain, the
United States and Soviet Russia.

The British Empire and Commonwealth

We shall base the whole of our international policy on a recognition that in
world affairs the Mother Country must act in the closest possible concert
with all other parts of the British Commonwealth and Empire. We shall
never forget their love and steadfastness when we stood alone against the
German Terror. We, too, have done our best for them.

The prowess of the Indian Army must not be overlooked in the framing of
plans for granting India a fuller opportunity to achieve Dominion Status We
should remember those friends who stood by us in our hour of peril, and
should be ever mindful of our obligations towards minorities and the Indian
States.

The arrangements made in war for constant mutual consultation with the
Dominions and India on all matters of joint interest must be perfected in
peace. In particular, the whole subject of Imperial defence must be reviewed
in relation to our world responsibilities and to modern weapons. Mutually
convenient arrangements must be made to foster Imperial trade.

Movement of men and women within the Empire must be made easier. A

two-way traffic should grow. Those who wish to change their homes should
be enabled to carry their national insurance rights with them wherever they

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1945/1945-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 14

1945 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

go. Imperial ties should be knit together by closer personal contact and
understanding.

Our record in colonial government is unsurpassed. Our responsibility to the
Colonies is to lead them forward to self-governing institutions; to help them
to raise their standards of life by agricultural advance, the application of
science and the building up of local industries; to improve conditions of
labour and of housing, to spread education, to stamp out disease and to
sustain health, vigour and happiness. The policy laid down in the Colonial
Development and Welfare Acts must be keenly pressed forward. The
resources of the Empire need to be developed for the benefit of all its many
peoples.

Defence

During a whole year of this great war Britain bore the burden of the struggle
alone. She must not lose her position in world affairs now that the war in
Europe is won. She cannot afford to break and squander the splendid
organisms of defence, Naval, Army and Air, which she has with so much
effort brought into existence. Above all the nucleus and special elements of
command and research must be kept in the highest position. The three
Services must be duly balanced in order to meet all the needs of new
weapons and new times. It will not be possible, until a new Parliament has
been assembled, to shape in detail the naval, military and air forces under
conditions of what we hope will be a lasting peace. There will, first of all, be
a prolonged occupation of Germany. We have immediately to relieve many
of those who have borne the brunt and long burden of the battle by others
who have not, so far, had the honour to go to the front.

I am in agreement with Mr. Bevin and other Leaders of the Socialist Party
that, until the end of the Japanese War and, I hope, until the World Security
Organization has become a reality, all citizens under a democratic
government should bear responsibility for defending their Country and its
Cause. By a system of national service according to their various aptitudes,
our young men must be trained to play their part if danger calls. Only a
Britain that is strong and ready to fight in defence of Freedom will count in
the high councils of the world and thus safeguard coming generations
against the immeasurable horrors of another war.

Four Years' Plan

More than two years ago I made a broadcast to the nation in which I
sketched a four years' plan which would cover five or six large measures of a
practical character, which must all have been the subject of prolonged,
careful and energetic preparation beforehand, and which fitted together into
a general scheme.

This plan has now been shaped, and we present it to the country for their
approval. Already a beginning has been made in carrying it out, and the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1945/1945-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 14

1945 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

Education Act for which our new Minister of Labour is greatly respected is
already the law of the land.

Back From the War

We welcome the opportunity of fulfilling all obligations of Service men and
women. The financial engagements, the provision of opportunities for
training for careers, and, above all, the plans for treatment and rehabilitation
of the disabled will be our duty and our aim.

The broad and properly considered lines of the demobilisation proposals,
based on age and length of service, which Mr. Bevin has elaborated with
much wisdom, will be adhered to, and releases will be made as quickly as
the condition of the tormented world permits.

Work

In the White Paper presented to Parliament by the late administration are
sound plans for avoiding the disastrous slumps and booms from which we
used to suffer, but which all are united in being determined to avoid in the
future.

The Government accepts as one of its primary aims and responsibilities the
maintenance of a high and stable level of employment.

Unless there is steady and ample work, there will not be the happiness, the
confidence, or the material resources in the country on which we can all
build together the kind of Britain that we want to see.

To find plenty of work with individual liberty to choose one's job, free
enterprise must be given the chance and the encouragement to plan ahead.
Confidence in sound government - mutual co-operation between industry
and the State, rather than control by the State - a lightening of the burdens of
excessive taxation - these are the first essentials.

Homes

In the first years of peace, the provision of homes will be the greatest
domestic task.

An all-out housing policy will not only make a tremendous contribution to
family life, but also to steady employment and to national health. All our
energy must be thrown into it. Local authorities and private enterprise must
both be given the fullest encouragement to get on with the job.

Prices of materials must be controlled as long as supplies are short. Even so,
building costs will be high at first. They must be brought down as rapidly as
possible. Subsidies will be necessary for local authorities and for private
enterprise alike.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1945/1945-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 14

1945 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

We must add to our building labour force as quickly as we can. The strength
of the industry was 1,000,000 men before the war. Now it is down to under
400,000. We have already made our plans to expand it as quickly as possible
up to and beyond its pre-war strength.

In blitzed areas the repair of war-damaged houses and the rebuilding of those
destroyed will be given high priority. In the first two years, as the labour
force grows, we intend to build at least 220,000 permanent new houses and
have a further 80,000 under way. We hope to increase this still further, but
do not intend to make promises we may not be able to fulfil. As the result of
intensive research work that has been carried out by many enterprising firms,
a number of new types of factory-made permanent houses and housing
equipment is being developed. (The erection of these makes a smaller
demand on our scarce building labour than the traditional types.) These will
be put into large-scale production with the same energy as was shown in
munitions. We must supplement this with at least 150,000 well-equipped
temporary houses that can be put up quickly. Our target is 200,000.

So long as there is a serious shortage of houses, rent control must continue
on houses controlled at present. The establishment of Tribunals throughout
the country to fix fair rents as between landlord and tenant (as recommended
by the Ridley Committee) seems to provide the best solution of a long-
standing problem.

The rebuilding of badly bombed areas, the general attack on the housing
problem and the redistribution of industry demand plans for the use of land
which will take into account the needs of each locality and the opportunities
offered by national resources. The Government will press forward with the
main lines of policy laid down in the Town and Country Planning Acts,
including the acquisition of land required in connection with the restoration
of blitzed areas on the basis of the 1939 value.

We shall bring forward in the new Parliament proposals for improving the
law with regard to compensation and betterment, so as to secure for the
future the best use of land in the public interest, including proper reservation
of open spaces and the best location of industry and housing.

Food and Agriculture

We must produce a great deal more food than we did before the war, because
food is scarce in the world to-day, and in any case we shall not be able to
buy as much imported food as we did.

A healthy and well-balanced agriculture is an essential element in our
national life. British agriculture will be maintained in a condition to enable
the efficient producer to obtain a reasonable return on the enterprise and the
capital invested, and to enable wages to be paid to the worker sufficient to
secure him a proper standard of living.

We must maintain the fertility of the soil; we must be skilful in the use and

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1945/1945-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 14

1945 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

management of our land for the production of the foodstuffs which it is best
fitted to provide, and which are most required to satisfy the nutritional needs
of our people.

We need Imperial co-operation, leading to international co-operation, in the
orderly production and marketing of food; and within this country we shall
have improved systems of marketing of home products and such other
arrangements as may be necessary to maintain stability and avoid the evils
of recurring scarcity and gluts. For this purpose each product will be treated
on its own merits.

Our policy will be one of stable markets and prices. In return for this all
occupiers and owners of agricultural land must maintain a reasonable
standard of good husbandry and estate management.

Within these principles the best results will be obtained by restoring the
greatest measure of freedom possible, and allowing full scope for each
farmer to make the best use of his land.

The war-time directions and controls will be progressively reduced as our
food situation improves and consequently the functions of the County
Agricultural Executive Committees will progressively be limited to that of
affording leadership, help and advice.

Educational facilities will be developed as fast as the necessary teaching
staff and buildings can be made available. The extension of agricultural
research will continue. The best scientific advice will be made available to
all farmers by the new advisory service.

Provision of smallholdings will be resumed as soon as labour and materials
can be spared for men who have gained experience as agricultural workers,
and allotments will be encouraged by every reasonable means.

The new Forestry Policy will result in far-reaching and permanent
programmes of afforestation. We must take care of our big trees, and make
provision for their replacement.

Better housing in country districts is a most urgent need. Large numbers of
new cottages in rural areas will be provided, as well as greater facilities for
bringing existing cottages and farms up to date. A wide extension of
electricity supply, water and sanitation will be undertaken for villages,
cottages and farms. No less necessary are better communications, better
health services and better social facilities for all who live and work in the
countryside.

A policy on these lines will secure a prosperous agriculture. That in its turn
will bring benefits to town and country alike, and help to provide our people
with good food for a steadily improving diet.

Our fishing industry must be restored with intense exertions and at the
utmost speed. In war the fishermen have been out after sterner catches, and
once again the nation has been well served in danger by their skill and

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1945/1945-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 14

1945 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

courage. We must rebuild the industry and make it a way of life which will
give attractive employment to the fine men it breeds. What we want now is
fish, and this must be tackled by every conceivable method.

National Insurance

National well-being is founded on good employment, good housing and
good health. But there always remain those personal hazards of fortune, such
as illness, accident or toss of a job, or industrial injury, which may leave the
individual and his family unexpectedly in distress. In addition, old age, death
and child-birth throw heavy burdens upon the family income.

One of our most important tasks will be to pass into law and bring into
action as soon as we can a nation-wide and compulsory scheme of National
Insurance based on the plan announced by the Government of all Parties in
1944.

In return for a single consolidated contribution there will be new and
increased benefits, amongst which is to be an old age or retirement pension
of 20/- for single people and 35/- for married couples. Family allowances are
one part of the great scheme, and the arrangements made will ensure that
men and women serving in the Forces and those disabled will benefit equally
with other classes in the community.

The new Ministry of National Insurance has been set up to prepare,
administer and control the whole of this great legislation. So massive and
complex a task can only be discharged by a large and highly-trained staff,
which has to be assembled and accommodated. The specialised experience
of the Approved Societies will therefore be drawn upon, and their
employees, especially those who have served at the front, must have due
consideration.

The scheme will not justify itself to the public unless the service given to
them in return for their contributions combines human understanding with
efficiency. There must be no queuing up for sickness benefits by those who
are entitled to them. The same standard of intimacy in personal relationships
must be maintained as formerly.

Health

The health services of the country will be made available to all citizens.
Everyone will contribute to the cost, and no one will be denied the attention,
the treatment or the appliances he requires because he cannot afford them.

We propose to create a comprehensive health service covering the whole
range of medical treatment from the general practitioner to the specialist, and
from the hospital to convalescence and rehabilitation; and to introduce
legislation for this purpose in the new Parliament.

The success of the service will depend on the skill and initiative of doctors,

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1945/1945-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 14

1945 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

dentists, nurses and other professional people, and in its designing and
operation there will be full scope for all the guidance they can give. Wide
play must be given to the preferences and enterprise of individuals. Nothing
will be done to destroy the close personal relationship between doctor and
patient, nor to restrict the patient's free choice of doctor.

The whole service must be so designed that in each area its growth is helped
and guided by the influence of a university. Through such a service the
medical and allied professions will be enabled to serve the whole nation
more effectively than they have yet been able to do. At the same time
Medicine will be left free to develop along its own lines, and to achieve
preventive as well as curative triumphs. Liberty is an essential condition of
scientific progress.

The voluntary hospitals which have led the way in the development of
hospital technique will remain free. They will play their part in the new
service in friendly partnership with local authority hospitals.

Motherhood must be our special care. There must be a large increase of
maternity beds and convalescent homes, and they must be provided in the
right places. Mothers must be relieved of onerous duties which at such times
so easily cause lasting injury to their health. The National Insurance Scheme
will make financial provision for these needs. All proper arrangements, both
voluntary and State-aided, must be made for the care of other young children
in the family, in order that the energies of the male breadwinner or the
kindness of neighbours and relations, which nevertheless must be the
mainspring, should not be unduly burdened. Nursery schools and nurseries
such as have grown up during the war should be encouraged. On the birth,
the proper feeding and the healthy upbringing of a substantially increased
number of children, depends the life of Britain and her enduring glory.

Education

The Education Act set forth in the ""Four Years' Plan"" has already been
piloted through Parliament by Mr. Butler. Our task in the coming years will
be to remodel our educational system according to the new law, and a
vigorous drive will be needed to supply the teachers and the buildings
necessary.

Our object is to provide education which will not produce a standardised or
utility child, useful only as a cog in a nationalised and bureaucratic machine,
but will enable the child to develop his or her responsible place, first n the
world of school, and then as a citizen. Many parents will be able to choose
the school they like and to play their part with the educational authorities in
the physical and spiritual well-being of their children.

Our aim must be to produce the good citizen of tomorrow. Our primary
schools call for much encouragement and improvement. Secondary
Education for all will have no meaning unless variety, practical training and,
above all, quality of standards convince parents that the extra schooling for

1945 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

their children is worth while. Technical education, at all levels, must be
greatly extended and improved.

No system of education can be complete unless it heightens what is splendid
and glorious in life and art. Art, science and learning are the means by which
the life of the whole people can be beautified and enriched.

Overseas Trade

Britain relies upon overseas trade for maintaining her people's standard of
living. Industry and employment are bound to depend largely on imported
raw materials. Even in wartime we have to draw one-third of our food from
abroad. Britain's investments overseas and our shipping, which helped to pay
for these imports before the war, have been largely sacrificed. In striving for
others we have become a debtor nation.

Therefore it is only by greatly increasing our exports and services that we
can buy the imports we require, and thus increase the whole vast volume of
our internal trade. The exchange of goods and services with Empire
countries is our most fertile and natural market.

We must do all we can in various ways to promote international trade, but of
course we cannot give up our right to safeguard our balance of payments by
whatever means are necessary: in the end the way to sell enough of our
exports abroad, both directly and by roundabout trade, is to take full
advantage of the great variety of British industry, the inventiveness of British
scientists and technicians, the enterprise and experience of British
manufacturers and merchants, and the skill of British workpeople and the
renowned trustworthiness of their output.

All possible encouragement will be given to the enterprise of individuals and
firms to take advantage of export opportunities of all kinds, and nothing
must be done to paralyse the spirit of adventure.

Industrial Efficency

The more efficient British industry is and the fuller the use it makes of
modern methods and materials, the higher will be the standard of well-being
that is possible for our people. We will stimulate scientific research in
industry and in the universities, and encourage the scrapping of obsolete
plant and methods in every possible way. Taxation must not bear unduly
upon new machinery and enterprise.

All that we long to achieve in making good the wartime shortage depends on
attaining the highest possible levels of peacetime production as fast as we
can. We shall fail in that if the British people, instead of fixing their eyes on
production, are led off at this moment into academic and spiteful
controversies about Socialism.

We should examine the conditions and the vital needs of every industry on

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1945/1945-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 14

1945 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

its own merits. We believe in variety, not in standardised and identical
structure, still less in bureaucratic torpor. We will not allow drastic changes
of ownership to be forced upon industries on no evidence except a political
theory, and with no practical regard to the results they may bring. To us the
tests will always be - what will conduce most to efficiency, and what will
render the greatest service to the community. This is the policy we shall
apply, whether it be coal, cotton or the heavy industries.

As against the advocates of State ownership and control, we stand for the
fullest opportunity for go and push in all ranks throughout the whole nation.
This quality is part of the genius of the British people, who mean to be free
to use their own judgment and never intend to be State serfs, nor always to
wait for official orders before they can act.

Monopolies

We must guard against abuses to which monopolies may give rise.

It is vital that there should be effective protection of the consumers' interests
and of the independent business, whether small or large, against any such
abuse. Nationalisation involves a State monopoly, with no proper protection
for anyone against monopoly power. Neither that nor any other form of
unfettered monopoly should be allowed to exist in Britain. The right remedy
against harmful restrictive practices is to set up an independent tribunal
before which charges of monopoly abuse can be laid. Its work and reports
should be public, so that any necessary action in restraint of abuse may be
taken by Parliament or otherwise.

Controls

We stand for the removal of controls as quickly as the need for them
disappears. Control of labour, of materials and of prices, is necessary in war,
when we have to give up much of our freedom in order to make sure that the
war machine gets all that it requires. Some of these controls will continue to
be needed until normal times return. As long as shortage of food remains,
rationing must obviously be accepted: the dangers of inflation also must be
guarded against.

As long as any wartime controls have to be retained, they must be made
subject to strict Parliamentary scrutiny and sanction. We must watch the
interest of the consumer always. Controls, originally imposed on his behalf,
tend to bind him down and injure him as soon as circumstances change.

We intend to guard the people of this country against those who, under guise

of war necessity, would like to impose upon Britain for their own purposes a
permanent system of bureaucratic control, reeking of totalitarianism.

The Small Man in Business

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1945/1945-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 14

1945 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

The small man in trade or industry, who adventures all he has in the effort to
make a success of the business he undertakes, must be given every chance to
make good. His independence of spirit is one of the essential elements that
made up the life of a free society. Many thousands of such men have been hit
bitterly hard by war. Other men may have jobs to go back to, but the
businesses of some of these men are gone, or hanging by a thread.

It will be a definite point in our policy to make certain that the problems of
the small man receive special attention. In particular, the returning Service
men or women who obtained their livelihood in this way must be given
every possible chance to re-establish themselves.

Fuel and Power

Coal is owned by the State, and is a wasting asset. The industry, taken by
and large, as the Reid Report shows, has fallen behind some of its
competitors overseas.

The industrial activities of this country are principally founded on coal.
Adequate supplies, as cheap as possible, must be available for our homes,
for our factories and for export. We cannot afford to lose a coal export trade.

Wartime measures are not suited to peacetime conditions. A new, practical
start is needed. The position cannot be remedied by mere change of
ownership of the collieries. That offers no solution.

A central authority, appointed by the Minister of Fuel and subject to his
general direction, will be set up, to insist that the necessary measures are
taken and to provide such help and guidance as is useful.

These measures centre upon the proper development and efficient conduct of
operations in each coalfield according to the best modern practice. In so far
as grouping or amalgamating collieries is necessary for this object, it will be
carried through, voluntarily if possible, but otherwise by compulsion.

At the same time in this diversified industry where conditions vary widely,
there are often to be found highly efficient undertakings which are
sometimes not large: in such cases amalgamation will only be proposed if
there are clear advantages to the nation and the industry; we do not propose
amalgamation for amalgamation's sake.

The making and carrying out of these plans will be undertaken by the
industry itself. The duty of the central authority will be to satisfy itself that
the scope and effect of the plans conform to national requirements, and it
will have powers of enforcement in reserve.

This policy will preserve the incentives of free enterprise and safeguard the
industry from the dead hand of State ownership or political interference in
day-to-day management. It will also provide the necessary sanctions for
making sure that the essential improvements recommended in the Reid
Report are carried through.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1945/1945-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 14

1945 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

At the same time, increased efficiency must be stimulated in the use and
handling of coal and its principal products, electricity and gas. There is room
for much greater coordination of the local distribution of these services.
Opportunities to increase the nation's resources by harnessing water power
also will be scientifically investigated and followed up.

Transport

Transport over land and over sea will have to remain under wartime control
for a time. We have still to work out detailed plans to meet the new needs of
peace. Road and rail, canals and coast-wise shipping, will be encouraged and
helped to bring to a successful conclusion plans already under discussion for
a transport system of the highest efficiency, in which each method would
play its appropriate part, with freedom for the public to choose which one to
use, and with protection against any risk of monopoly charges.

New proposals for Civil Aviation, based broadly on the White Paper of
1945, will be adopted and speedily brought into operation.

This policy will ensure the full development of our Commonwealth and
Empire services on the partnership lines already established; there will be
co-operation with foreign governments on all overseas services linking our
country and theirs; we shall at the same time expand our air services within
the United Kingdom, aiming at the most complete network of services in and
between England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

We shall see to it that air transport undertakings are free to manage the
services for which they are responsible and that there shall be ample
opportunity for development, and for newcomers to enter the lists in the
United Kingdom. It is, of course, our intention that British Air Lines shall
use British aircraft and we are satisfied that those aircraft in peace as in war
will be second to none.

We must ensure the maintenance of a large, modern and highly efficient
Merchant Navy. This country must never forget the debt she owes to her
merchant seamen. The men who sailed the convoys to Britain, to Malta, to
Russia and all over the world must be sure of steady employment, ships
designed to give them good living conditions, good standards of food, and
proper provision for their welfare.

There will shortly be a large world surplus of wartime shipping and we shall

enter into international consultations for its orderly disposal and for avoiding
competitive subsidies after the war.

Money

Our war budget has been rendered possible only by the severest taxation
pressing heavily on everybody, by borrowing on a vast scale to meet the
passing crisis, by huge Lend-Lease supplies from the United States and by

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1945/1945-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 14

1945 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

generous gifts from Canada and elsewhere. All this cannot go on.

The State has no resources of its own. It can only spend what it takes from
the people in taxes or borrowing. Britain is now a nation of taxpayers. Its
record of providing more than half of the national expenditure during the last
years of the war from taxation is unsurpassed. The willingness of this
generation to bear their fair share of sacrifices must, though we hope for
relief, be continued. Our future needs for the war against Japan, for winding
up the German war, and the plans for social progress which we are
determined to carry out, cause and require a much higher rate of national
expenditure than before the war.

This burden must be borne by all citizens as taxpayers. There is no easy way
of one section getting great benefits from the State at the expense of another.
The nation can have the services it is prepared to pay for. Where all benefit,
all will have to contribute. The revenue is not created by waving a magic
wand. It is drawn from the fruits of the nation's industry, agriculture and
commerce. It is won by work and paid in taxes. The present level of taxation
drastically restricts the ability of the ordinary citizen to satisfy his personal
desires. It is discouraging to his enterprise and his efforts to better himself by
doing the bit extra, for so large a part of anything he gains to be removed by
the tax-collector.

It will be our aim and purpose to make an early reduction in taxation ina
way that will stimulate energy and permit free individual choice. The
Government will re-examine the whole structure of taxation in relation to the
level at which expenditure will stand after the war, in order to lighten the
burden where it presses most, and simplify the tax system.

We will not permit any monkeying with the people's savings. Our desire is to
see property widely spread, and we rejoice that the savings movement,
which must go on, has now made almost everyone a property-owner. An
object of our financial policy is to keep prices from rising, and make sure
that savers do not see the purchasing-power of their savings dwindle.

On a basis of high employment, initiative and hard work on the part of
everyone, we can achieve our great Four Years' programme. It is well worth
achieving.

Our Purpose

Ours is a great nation and never in its history has it stood in higher repute in
the world than today. Its greatness rests not on its material wealth, for that
has been poured out in full measure, nor upon its armed might, which other
nations surpass. It has its roots in the character, the ability, and the
independence of our people and the magic of this wonderful island. British
virtues have been developed under the free institutions which our fathers and
forefathers struggled through the centuries to win and to keep. We of this
generation are trustees for posterity, and the duty lies upon us to hand down
to our children unimpaired the unique heritage that was bequeathed to us.

1945 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

This is a country built on family life. War and separation have strengthened,
not impaired, the love of home. The children must always come first. The
Education Act, school meals, family allowances, all show that Parliament is
realising that. Family life is a precious asset to be defended at all costs.

We are dedicated to the purpose of helping to rebuild Britain on the sure
foundations on which her greatness rests. In recent generations, enormous
material progress has been made. That progress must be extended and
accelerated not by subordinating the individual to the authority of the State,
but by providing the conditions in which no one shall be precluded by
poverty, ignorance, insecurity, or the selfishness of others from making the
best of the gifts with which Providence has endowed him.

Our programme is not based upon unproved theories or fine phrases, but
upon principles that have been tested anew in the fires of war and not found
wanting. We commend it to the country not as offering an easy road to the
nation's goal but because, while safeguarding our ancient liberties, it tackles
practical problems in a practical way.

1935 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

A call to the nation: the joint manifesto of the
leaders National Government (Stanley Baldwin,
J. Ramsay MacDonald and Sir John Simon)

The decision of the Nation four years ago to put its trust in a National
Government formed from various Parties in the State, was a turning point in
the history of Britain and has exercised a profound influence upon the course
of international events. Under this leadership we have emerged from the
depths of depression to a condition of steadily returning prosperity, and the
name of Britain stands high in the councils of the world. There now falls
upon the people of this country the grave responsibility of exercising a
choice which may well prove equally momentous for the future.

The broad issue is whether the stability and confidence with the National
Government have built up are to be preserved in a period of special difficulty
and anxiety. But we have considered it right, for the information of the
Electors, to set forth on behalf of a united Government their general aims
and policy on various aspects of home and foreign affairs.

The League of Nations

The League of Nations will remain, as heretofore, the keystone of British
foreign policy. The prevention of war and the establishment of settled peace
in the world must always be the most vital interest of the British people, and
the League is the instrument which has been framed and to which we look
for the attainment of these objects. We shall therefore continue to do all in
our power to uphold the Covenant and to maintain and increase the
efficiency of the League. In the present unhappy dispute between Italy and
Abyssinia where will be no wavering in the policy we have hitherto pursued.
We shall take no action in isolation, but we shall be prepared faithfully to
take our part in any collective action decided upon by the League and shared
in by its Members. We shall endeavour to further any discussion which may
offer the hope of a just and fair settlement, provided that it be within the
framework of the League and acceptable to the three parties to the dispute -
Italy, Abyssinia and the League itself.

Peace and Defence

Peace is not only the first interest of the British people; it is the object to

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1935/1935-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 8

1935 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

which all their hopes and efforts are diverted. Our attitude to the League is
dictated by the conviction that collective security by collective action can
alone save us from a return to the old system which resulted in the Great
War. The Covenant itself requires that national armaments should be
measured both by the needs of national defence and by the duty of fulfilling
international obligations. A Commonwealth which holds the positino in the
world occupied by the United Kingdom and its partners in the British
Empire must always take an influential part in League discussions. But our
influence can be fully exerted only if we are recognised to be strong enough
to fulfil any obligations which, jointly with others, we may undertake. The
fact is that the actual condition of our defence forces is not satisfactory. We
have made it clear that we must in the course of the next few years do what
is necessary to repair the gaps in our defences, which have accumulated over
the past decade, and we shall in due course present to Parliament our
proposals, which will include provisions to ensure that the programme, is
carried out without either waste or unreasonable profit to contractors.

Limitation of armaments

The defence programme will be strictly confined to what is required to make
the country and the Empire safe, and to fulfil our obligations towards the
League. All the world knows that Britain will never use her forces for any
aggressive purpose. And we shall not for one moment relax our efforts to
attain, by international agreement, a general limitation of armaments by
every possible means, whether by restriction of numbers or by prohibition of
weapons and methods of warfare. Already we have summoned a new Naval
Conference to meet in London this year, at which we earnestly hope it may
be possible to continue the good work done in this direction at the previous
Naval Conferences of Washington and London.

Imperial Policy

The Agreements entered into at Ottawa in 1932 marked the beginning of a
new epoch in inter-imperial trading relations. The results of those
Agreements have increased employment both in the Dominions and in this
country, without injuring the rest of the world, and it is our intention further
to promote the exchange of goods between ourselves and our partners in the
Empire, believing that any increase in their prosperity will always be
reflected in an increase in the volume of British trade and employment.

The Colonial Empire also benefited greatly by the arrangements made at
Ottwa. The greatest need of the British Colonies today is an extension of
their markets. Special and sympathetic consideration will be given to the
possibilities of providing further facilities to enable them to sell their
products to the best advantage in the markets of the world and thereby
increase their purchase of British goods.

Overseas Trade

While the growing volume of British exports to the Dominions and Colonies

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1935/1935-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 8

1935 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

has done something to fill the gap left by the shrinkage of international trade
since 1929, it still remains true that if our foreign trade could be restored to
its former dimensions an immense fillip would be given to employment in
this country. It is probable that the reduction of excessive tariffs and the
abolition of quotas and of other barriers to international trade will only come
about by degress as general confidence is restored. There are, however,
hopeful indications that opinion is moving in the right direction. In the
meantime it will be our endeavour to continue the policy of reducing these
barriers by means of bilateral commercial treaties, which has already had so
beneficial an effect in increasing our exports to the countries with whom we
have been able to make trade agreements.

Agriculture

A properous countryside is an essential foundatino of national well-being.
The National Government have from the first recognised that agriculture is
not one but many industries, each working under different conditions and
requiring different treatments for its improvement . Accordingly, they have
had to make use of import duties, levies, or combinations of these devices
according to the circumstances of each case. The producers have played their
part by organisation and co-operation, and this we have encouraged and
helped. So bold a treatment was bound to raise some problems not yet
solved, but we can claim that, broadly speaking, our efforts have met with
success. The prices received by farmers have recovered by 15 per cent from
the low point of two years ago. The agricultural worker in England and
Wales has today an average wage which is the highest recorded for ten years.
At the same time the customer in the shops has been able this year to buy
more food for 19s. than could be bought for £1 when the Government took
office. Yet it is important for our townspeople to recognise that it is not wise
to rely entirely upon foodstuffs brought from overseas. The prudent
housewife wants some at least of her supplies from near at hand, where they
would be readily available in any circumstances.

It has already been announced that the Government have accepted the
principle of unemployment insurance for agricultural workers, and it is our
intention, if returned, to introduce legislation to that end.

In all branches of agriculture our policy has been and will remain one of
expansion of the home market. As the market expands home production can
expand with it, and in this way only can a real opportunity be afforded for
new men to make a career on the land.

Fisheries

The Government have recognised the great importance of the fishing
industry and have taken vigorous and far-reaching measures to assist the
fishermen round our coasts. Here, again, our policy is to extend the market
both at home and abroad. We shall not slacken in our efforts to carry this
policy into effect.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1935/1935-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 8

1935 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

Employment

The remarkable fact that more persons are now employed in this country
than ever before in its whole history has not sprung from accident or the
unfettered operation of natural las. It has been the result of the deliberate
policy of the Government in protecting the home market and in creating a
regime of cheap money, which has facilitated enterprise and stimulated
industrial expansion. In particular, cheap money, resulting from the
increased confidence in Great Britain, has been the most powerful factor in
bringing about the phenomenal growth of the building industry, which is the
most far-reaching of all home industries in the wide field of employment
which it creates. It is porbable that the improvement in the home trade,
which has been so marked a feature of the past four years, has by no means
reached its limit. Nevertheless, the Government are constantly working on
all kinds of plans by which they make use of the present favourable
circumstances to inititate new enterprises, thereby creating additional
employment by use of credit or other resources of the State. The building of
the Queen Mary, the subsidy to tramp shipping, the production of oil from
coal by the hydrogenation process, and the great scheme of London transport
improvements, at a cost of between £30 and £40 millions, are instances in
point. Further schemes of a similar character are under consideration, and
will, if the National Government are returned to power, be announced from
time to time as they mature.

Unemployment Assistance

The arrangments under the Unemployment Assistance scheme have received
prolonged and anxious consideration by the Government, and, as already
stated in Parliament, no alteration will be made in the existing ""standstill""
arrangements before next spring at the earliest. The Government regard it as
important to maintain the existing powers of the Unemployment Assistance
Board and the general framework of the Unemployment Assistance Act.
They will, however, give effect to any recommendations by the Board for
improved arrangements, where these may be shown by experience to be
desirable. The ""standstill"" arrangements are, as they were always intended to
be, temporary. They must be replaced by permanent arrangments, which
must remedy certain abuses and at the same time avoid hardship to
applicants. Any action must be gradual, and must be carried out in full
association with local opinion, so as to give effect to reasonable differences
in the localities. As regards the Means Test, the Government believe that no
responsible person would seriously suggest that Unemployment Assisteance,
which is not insurance benefit, ought to be paid without regard to the
resources properly available to the applicant. The question is not whether
there should be a Means Test, but what that test should be. This is a matter
which is now under close examination, but in any scheme great importance
will be attached to maintaining the unity of family life and, in addition,
provision will be made to meet any cases of proved hardship.

Special Areas and the Coal Mining Industry

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1935/1935-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 8

1935 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

No branch of the Government's activities has been more constantly
misrepresented that their work in the Special Areas. From the first they have
recognised that in these areas - the unfortunate victimes of a contraction in
the limited number of great industries on which they were formerly chiefly
dependent - the problems of unemployment present features of exceptional
difficulty. The removal of these difficulties and the restoration of the areas to
their proper position in the normal life of the country must necessarily take
time. The Government have shown their determination to grapple with the
situation by the appointment of the Special Commissioners, and the granting
to them of special powers to facilitate their work. As a commencement, a
sum of two million pounds was placed at the Commissioners' disposal, with
an intimation that more would be forthcoming as it was required. Already
the commitments have considerably exceeded the initial sum, and financial
considerations will not be allowed to stand in the way of any practical and
reasonable scheme.

It is generally recognised that the depression of the Special Areas has been
brought about by the contraction in certain large industries, prominent
among which is coal mining. Any improvement in this industry, therefore,
while it would affect much larger districts than are comprised in the Special
Areas, would bring particular benefits to them. The market for coal has been
gradually curtailed by economy in its use, by the growth of competitive fuels
and by the introduction of restrictive measures in foreign markets. There are,
however, certain directions in which the industry can be made more efficient,
and we hope more profitable, for the miner will always rightly command the
sympathy of the public in his dangerous calling, and there is no part of the
community that would not wish to see employment in the industry improved
to the level of wages raised. The Government are convinced that improved
selling arrangements, without which there is not the money in the industry to
provide a higher rate of wages, should be put into operation and, if given the
opportunity, we shall devote our energy to ensuring that measures to attain
this object are adopted at an early date. We have further decided to effect the
unification of coal-mining royalties, a step which will enable greater
progress to be made with the organisation of production and thus improve
the efficiency of the industry. Nor shall we neglect the problems of safety in
coal mining. A Royal Commission will be set up to examine these subjects
afresh, and to consider, not only how the present rules and regulations can
best be brought up to date in the light of modern methods, but also how the
latest discoveries of scientific research can help to secure the safety of those
working in the pits.

The introduction of new industries into the Special Areas is extremely
desirable. As a result of the efforts which have already been made by the
Special Commissioners, and of other plans which are under consideration, it
is hoped to enter upon new industrial developments, including the
preparation of a trading estate in which industrialists can find ready-made
factories provided with all the necessary services. While every effort will be
made to find the maximum amount of employment in the Special Areas,
increased attention will be given to the training and transfer of such labour
as cannot be provided for locally to other places where greater opportunities
will be open to them. It may be observed that the new orders required for

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1935/1935-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 8

1935 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

defence purposes will undoubtedly bring a considerable volume of work and
employment into some parts of the country which hitherto have been most
hard hit by the heavy depression, and most backward in feeling the general
improvement which has been manifest elsewhere.

Social Reform

On the foundations which sound financial policy has laid, new and rapid
progress in Social Reform has again become possible. We have already
referred to the immense development in housing. In the four years during
which the Government have been in office more than 1,000,000 houses have
been built. A very considerable proportion are small houses, and a
substantial number which are being erected today are houses ""to let"". The
Slum Clearance campaign is actively proceeding. Already 420,000 occupiers
have been actually rehoused, and transfer to new and well-built homes is
now proceeding at the unprecedented rate of over 200,000 persons a year.
The first steps have already been taken to deal with the evil of overcrowding
in accordance with the provisions of the Acts which have just been placed
upon the Statute Book. We shall proceed vigorously with all these efforts.

There are a number of other Social Reforms long dealyed by the necessity of
first restoring the national finances, which are now ripe for action. The
Contributory Pensions scheme has been a boon of inestimable value to large
numbers of the people. But it has always been recognised that it was not
complete so long as persons with small incomes, but not themselves
insurably employed, were unable to share in its benefits. Accordingly the
Government will, if returned, supplement the present scheme by
arrangements which will permit other men - and women, too - whether
working on their own account or not, such as shopkeepers, clerks and other
black-coated workers, whose income does not exceed a certain limit, to
enjoy the benefits of widows', orphans' and old age contributory pensions on
a voluntary basis.

Education must always take a foremost place in social progess, and for some
time past the Government have been engaged in drawing up a
comprehensive scheme of reform. Full details are being published
elsewhere; here it suffices to say that it includes the raising of the school-
leaving age to fifteen, with exemptions for those children who can obtain
satisfactory employment. Considerable preparations, which include
reorganisation of schools as well as the provision of further accommodation,
will be necessary before this can be made effective. Financial adjustments
will include provisions, by which building grants can be made to non-
provided schools towards meeting these obligations, and also increased
grants can be made to non-provided schools towards meeting these
obligations, and also increased grants to Local Authorities for school
buildings and conveyance of children.

Finally, a great combined effort should now be made to raise still further the

general standard of health of the Nation, especially that of the younger
generation. It will require a simultaneous attack on many fronts. We must

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1935/1935-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 8

further improve our maternity services and make provision of Nursery
Schools. We must meet the increasing demand, especially from our young
people, for further physical exercise and training, both in the schools and
after school days are over.

We have prepared plans covering all these apects of this important subject,
and when carried into effect they will go far to ensure that future generations
shall bave full opportunities for the enjoyment of life that comes from the
possession of a healthy mind in a healthy body.

Scotland

Scottish problems will continue to receive sympathetic attention. The
programme outlined will be generally applicable to the United Kingdom, but
in many spheres separate treatment is necessary to meet the special
circumstances of Scotland. In particular, the further improvement of housing
in the rural as well as urban areas; the needs of Scottish agriculture; the
settling of families, and the finding of work for the unemployed, on the land;
the provision of water supply and drainage, especially in the sparsely
populated areas; and the further betterment of the fishing industry and of the
Highlands and Islands will be the subject of special care and attention.

The Choice Before the Country

The advent of power of the Labour Opposition, pledged to a number of
revolutionary measures of which the ultimate results could not be clearly
foreseen, would inevitably be followed by a collapse of confidence. The
measures we have outlined above can only be carried through if the
resources of the country are such as to enable it to support the necessary
cost. Those resources must be derived from the income of the country, and
that income can only increase if the country can rely on a period in which
stability will be assured and confidence remain undisturbed.

The international situation reinforces the same lesson. The influence of
Britain among other mations, now so conspicuous, could never be
maintained under an Administration drawn from a Party whose leaders of
experience in foreign affairs no longer co-operate with it, and which is
hopelessly divided on the most important points in foreign policy.

In present circumstances it is more than ever necessary that the British
Government should not only be united among themselves, but that they

should represent that spirit of national co-operation which will best secure
the confidence and respect of the world.

1929 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

The nation's duty: Stanley Baldwin's Election
Message

It is barely two months since my decision to join the National Government
was unanimously endorsed at a meeting of Members of Parliament and
Candidates held at the Kingsway Hall in London. At that time we expected
that the co-operation then secured would last only a few weeks, but recent
events have rendered it necessary, in my view, that the period of this co-
operation should be extended. The Budget has been balanced. Borrowing
has been stopped at the cost of sacrifices from every class of the community,
sacrifices which are heavy but which, I hope and believe, as the result of a
continuance of our policy may be temporary. But we have not yet balanced
the Trade Account of the Nation: in other words, we are not yet earning
enough to pay for what we have to buy from Overseas. Unless this position
can be altered nothing can save us from ultimate bankruptcy.

Our Country's Safety

We must shrink from no steps to prove the stability of our country and to
save our people from the disaster attaching to a currency fluctuating and
falling through lack of confidence at home and abroad.

A National Mandate

To complete this work it is imperative that the Government should have a
national mandate giving it freedom to use whatever means may be found
necessary after careful examination to effect the end in view. It is necessary
that in place of a small Parliamentary majority we should have a stable
Government with a large majority backed by the resolution of a great
majority of the electors. The country must show in no uncertain matter that it
will have nothing to do with a party whose programme could only convert a
situation grave already into one of chaos and catastrophe. Some of the
problems that lie before us are wide as the world itself. Some are peculiar to
ourselves.

In the international field we have to consider war debts and reparations,
disarmament, the unequal distribution of the world supply of gold and the
mutual financial dependence of the countries of the world. Those questions
may well tax the statesmanship of all nations.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1931/1931-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 3

1931 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

At home the paramount question is that of the adverse Balance of Trade, the
redress of which is essential to secure our financial stability. This can be
accomplished only be reducing imports, by increasing exports, or by a
combination of both.

Tariffs Essential

I am prepared to examine any method which can effect what is required. I
recognised that the situation is altered by the devaluation of the pound, but
in my view the effect of that devaluation can be no valid substitute for a
tariff, carefully designed and adjusted to meet the present situation. I shall,
therefore, continue to press upon the electors that in my view the tariff is the
quickest and most effective weapon not only to reduce excessive imports but
to enable us to induce other countries to lower their tariff walls.

The position of Agriculture is one which in my judgement is so desperate as
to call for immediate and far-reaching measures of relief. To this end the first
step should be assistance to cereal farmers, and we have in no way changed
our view that the best form of assistance is by means of a quota and
guaranteed price for wheat.

‘Farmers Must be Secured Against Dumping'

Farmers must be secured against dumping, which has brought so many
branches of their industry to ruin. The production of food at home should be
increased and the drain of men from the land stopped, and to this end and to
make Imperial treaties which may be of enormous value to us as a nation we
shall require such a fee hand as will allow us to use prohibitions, quotas or
duties as may seem most effective in the circumstances.

Empire Economic Unity

The Problem of the Empire is to secure that economic unity for which we
have so long striven. I hope that the reasons which led to a suspension of the
Ottawa Conference have been overcome, and that it will be possible for the
Canadian Government to renew its invitation. We shall then have a unique
opportunity before us in the fact that it will fall to the National Government
to accept that invitation.

The ideal of Imperial Economic Unity is widespread today, and I am
confident that the foundation of such unity will be well and truly laid with
such general assent of our people as would have seemed impossible but a
few short years ago.

All must Help

The National Government has with your help accomplished the first part of
its work. We are passing through stern and difficult times; our task will be
impossible without the support of the nation.

1931 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:42

For that support we appeal with confidence, and in the winning of that
support I believe a great part will be played by those I am proud to lead.

1929 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

Stanley Baldwin's Election Address

Four and a half years ago, you returned me to Parliament and to Office as the
leader of a great majority. Today it is my duty to lay before you the record of
the Conservative and Unionist Government and its policy for the future; and
to ask at your hands a renewal of your confidence. The Conservative
Government has had to face difficulties and dangers at home and abroad
which could not have been foreseen at the last Election. In spite of all
obstacles, we have fulfilled the pledges given in 1924, to an extent which no
Government has equalled, and as a result of our administration the Empire is
more firmly united, the prestige of the country stands higher, the prosperity
the welfare of our people is greater than ever before in our history. In
submitting myself to the electorate, I make no spectacular promises for a
sudden transformation of our social or industrial conditions, but I am
resolved to maintain and consolidate the advance already made, to bring to
fruition the schemes on which we are engaged, and to carry still further the
solid work of reconstruction on which depend the unity of the Empire and
the peace and well-being of its people.

The Empire

The Imperial Conference of 1926 will remain a memorable landmark in the
constitutional development of the British Empire. The policy of any British
Government of the future must be based on the principle then laid down: that
the unity of the British Commonwealth is to be maintained by unfettered co-
operation between its partner members, who enjoy an equal freedom under
the Crown. This principle has consistently inspired and shapred our policy.
In foreign affairs, in defence, in trade and in migration, we have worked and
shall work to promote unity of aim and every form of helpful co-operation
with the Dominions.

Imperial Preference

Among these forms of co-operation none is of greater importance than the
policy of Imperial Preference. That policy we have consistently and
successfully pursued from the first moment of our entry into office.
Reversing the unwise action of our predecessors, we at once honoured all the
undertakings given at the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923, partly by
the preferential remission of existing duties, and partly by the establishment
of the Empire Marketing Board. The preferences to which we then gave

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1929/1929-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 15

1929 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:43

effect have since been stabilised and extended with excellent results. In
sugar, tobacco, silk, coffee, cocoa, dried fruits, and wine, there has been a
great expansion of Empire products. The Empire Marketing Board has
proved its value as a new agency of Imperial co-operation in many ways,
and not least by its encouragement of scientific research both in Britain and
in the Dominions and Colonies. Throughout the Empire, our policy has met
with an appreciative response. The Empire today is by far our best market,
buying nearly as much of our manufactures as all foreign countries together.
Our opponents both liberal and Socialist, have, by their action in 1924, and
by their declarations since, shown their determined hostility to the whole
idea of Imperial Preference. We, on the contrary, have demonstrated its great
possibilities, and subject to my pledge not to impose any protective taxation
on food, we shall continue to promote it as an essential part of our policy of
Imperial development.

Colonial Development

In working out a policy of Imperial development, we have a special duty
towards the vast colonial territories for which the British nation is
responsible. That duty was defined at the end of last century by Joseph
Chamberlain, when he declared that these territories should be treated as the
undeveloped estates of the British Empire to be developed by British capital
and British enterprise. Such a task is frequently beyond the unaided
resources of the Colony concerned, for trade and population will follow
rather than precede the opening up of the country. For this purpose transport
must be improved and production must be stimulated by scientific research,
but capital expended upon these subjects may often bring in no return for
several years.

We propose, therefore, to extend the expedite the policy already pursued in
Africa and elsewhere, which in the past 4.5 years has resulted in so great an
expansion in the Colonial market for British produce. A Colonial
Development Fund will be created which will assist Colonial Governments
in financing approved projects of development.

While thus fulfilling our responsibilities towards the native populations and
towards those of our own race who have linked their fortunes with them, we
regard the employment of British capital to finance British enterprise as
likely to prove a more fruitful investment for this country than speculative
loans or guarantees to a foreign Government which has squandered its own
resources in a futile war against capitalism, and which has hitherto shown
neither a friendly disposition to us nor any readiness to recognise past
obligations.

Trade and Employment

This policy of Empire development forms part of a comprehensive
programme directed to stimulate trade and to create permanent employment.
The following are the main features in that programme.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1929/1929-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 15

1929 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM
Safeguarding

First, we are pressing steadily on with our policy of helping special
industries. The country has watched with keen interest the progress and
effect of safeguarding. Few people are interested in catchwords; they want to
judge by practical results. The results of the duties which have been imposed
are already apparent. Not only has employment been improved in every one
of the safeguarded industries, but coal, steel, engineering, building, transport
and other industries have profited by orders received and work created. The
employment thus given directly and indirectly has put thousands of men in
work, has increased their purchasing power, and has thus benefited the
distributive trades. In many cases prices have been reduced because costs of
production have fallen with increased output. Exports over the whole range
of dutiable articles have materially increased; efficiency has been
encouraged; new capital has been introduced; new factories have been built
and existing factories have been extended. This expereince has convinced
many people of the wisdom of our policy. Our opponents have consistently
obstructed it and are committed to its reversal, a step which must throw
thousands out of work. We, on the other hand, are determined to continue it.
We pledged ourselves at the last Election that there should be no protective
taxation of food and that there should be no general tariff. We have kept that
pledge and we renew it. Bu, subject to that pledge, we intend that no
manufacturing industry, large or small, shall be debarred from presenting its
case for a safeguarding duty to an impartial tribunal, which will judge each
case on its merits and make recommendations accordingly.

Rating Relief

One of the main purposes of safeguarding duties, as of Empire development
is to stimulate the export trade.

No greater stimulus could, however, be given in this direction than the great
scheme of Rating Relief which we have carried through in the face of
persistent opposition from our political opponents, and which we are not
putting into force. By relieving the whole of productive industry from three-

fourths of the burden of rates we have not only swept away an unjust form of

taxation but have greatly increased the competitive power of our national
industries. This is no temporary or sporadic encouragement. It is on the
contrary a continuing benefit, which will add about £27 millions every year
to the resources of industry. This unprecedented measure of relief operates
universally. The assistance is greatest where the need is greatest; but it is no
mere subsidy to the depressed industries. It is an essential feature of the
scheme that it should also encourage the prosperous industries on which we
rely to create new employment, and the distrbutive industries on which we
rely to create new employment, and the distributive trades will benefit by the
increased purchasing power of the wage earners.

Railway Freights

One important part of the Rating Reform Scheme has already been brought

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1929/1929-conservative-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 12:43

Page 3 of 15

1929 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

into operation - the reduction of railway freights. By this means the heavy
basic industries have been granted reductions of freights amounting in all to
more than £3 millions a year, while agriculture is benefited by similar relief
amounting to over £750,000. Already this reduction is having marked effect
on the recovery of these industries.

The Basic Industries and the Railways

Here we approach the central problem of our national trade. The heavy basic
industries of Britain - the coal, iron and stell group - depend upon the
railways. Their traffics can only be carried along the steel track. They
employ a fifth of our insured wage earners, contain more than a quarter of
the whole number of the unemployed and constitute with cotton and wollens
two-thirds of our export trade. It is to this point especially that help must be
directed if unemployment is to be swiftly and effectually reduced to normal.
The rating relief scheme and particularly the reduction of railway freights
and dock dues is designed to afford a special measure of assistance to these
industries and to agriculture. The remission of the railway passenger duty in
the Budget has enabled the railways to undertake a programme of capital
expenditure amounting to £6.5 millions, which will assist to modernise and
develop the means of transport, and will facilitate the use of heavier rolling
stock. In our view the basic trades of Britain which have to depend on the
railways as their principal means of transport ought to have at their disposal
facilities at least equal to any transportation system in any part of the world.
The Government will take such steps as may seem to them necessary to
assist the railways, and the industries concerned, to achieve this end.

Road Development

While we attach special importance to railway development we realise the
part which our great highways must play in a national transportation system.

The last five years have seen the building and improvement of roads upon
the greatest scale yet known, although our roads are already the best in the
world, and we are spending more upon them than any European nation.

At the present time we are making provisino for an annual expenditure from
the Road Fund of £23 millions as compared with £15 millions in the year in
which we took office, while the total expenditure on roads out of rates and
taxes amounts to approximately £60 millions a year. The percentages of
State contribution to the various classes of roads have been increased, and
the problem of rural roads have been met by substantial increases in the
grants towards them.

Throughout its tenure of office the policy of the Government has been to
encourage and assist highway authorities to pursue a comprehensive and
orderly programme of road development, improvement and maintenance.

We intend to pursue this policy, paying special attention to the improvements

which will give immediate assistance to our trade and thus bring in a full

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1929/1929-conservative-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 12:43

1929 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:43

return for the money expended, rather than to put in hand hasty and ill-
considered schemes which could only lead to wasteful and unfruitment
expenditure, and could be of no permanent benefit to the unemployed.

Electrical Development

If modern industry needs an efficient transportation system, it needs no less a
fully adequate supply of electrical power. There has been no more
remarkable achievement in recent times than the re-organisation of the
generation and transmission of electricity in Great Britain which was
effected by the Electricity (Supply) Act. Progress under that Act has been
rapid. It was passed at the end of 1926; in March, 1927, the Central
Electricity Board was established, and by the coming Autumn detailed
schemes will have been prepared covering about 97 per cent. of the
population of 98 per cent. of the present sales of current. The placing of
contracts in respect of the constructional work on the transmission system
has been pressed on, and the total value of orders already placed amounts to
£8.5 millions, all of which have been placed with British firms. Further
substantial orders will be placed during the year and unemployment in the
skilled electrical trades is practically non-existent.

Training

While we are thus directing our policy primarily to the permanent restoration
of industrial prosperity, on which the solution of the unemployment problem
depends, we have also undertaken a wide range of subsidiary measures
designed to enable the unemployed, especially in the depressed areas, to find
permanent work.

Training Centres have been established which have already enabled
thousands of men and women to fit themselves for new employment. The
system of juvenile unemployment centres has been greatly developed, and
more than 250,000 boys and girls have passed through these centres. As a
result of these and other measures, the problem of juvenile unemployment
has been largely overcome. There is now little unemployment among boys
and girls, except in the depressed mining areas, and as a result of the
arrangements made while we have been in office, practically every boy in
these areas can now attend an unemployment centre when he is unemployed,
and there be fitted for a carefully chosen job elsewhere.

We shall steadily expand our training system, as need requires, and we shall
continue to provide money for public works with due regard to the
requirements of industry for which the maintenance of public credit is so
necessary.

The Past and the Future in Industry

The policy outlined above has already justified itself. Employment improved
under our administration until the Spring of 1926 when, for the first time
since the great depression of 1920, the number of unemployed fell below a

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1929/1929-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 15

1929 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:43

million. Trade then suffered a severe set-back owing to the General Strike,
and the industrial troubles of 1926. In the last two years it has made a
remarkable recovery.

In the insured industries, other than the coal mining industry, there are now
800,000 more people employed and 125,000 fewer unemployed than when
we assumed office. The coal industry itself is now reviving; many thousands
of miners displaced by the re-organisation of the industry have been
absorbed into other industries and there are 150,000 fewer miners
unemployed than nine months ago.

This recovery has been achieved by the combined efforts of our people
assisted by the Government's policy of helping industry to help itself. The
establishment of stable conditions has given industry confidence and
opportunity.

A new spirit of co-operation is abroad. Fewer days have been lost through
trade disputes in 1927 and 1928 than in any year since records were
established forty years ago. Negotiations on a friendly basis are proceeding
between the partners in industry.

If such co-operation continues with peace at home and abroad, and if full
effect is given to the Government's proposals for helping trade, there is every
reason to believe that trade and industry will be placed on a sound basis and
that men and women will find permanent employment at their proper trades
in steadily increasing numbers.

The Rights and Welfare of the Partners in Trade and Industry

This peace and revival in industry opens the way to a revision and
improvement of the Factory laws.

This is the one pledge we gave at the last Election which we have been
unable to fulfil. It was impossible to legislate wisely for industry still torn by
dissensions and harassed by the uncertainties following the troubles of 1926.
In our view the time has now arrived for the enactment of a single and
clearly drafted statute which shall protect the health, safety and general
welfare of the workers without imposing on industry burdens which might
retard its recovery.

Factory legislation of this kind will complete the work we have already done
to give greater security to the partners in trade and industry. By the
legislation we have passed during our term of office we have given both to
the business tenant and to shop assistants a measure of security which they
have long demands. By the Trade Disputes Act the Trade Unions were
protected against the misuse of the strike weapon for political and
revolutionary ends, and the Trade Unionist has been secured against
intimidation and coercion in the free exercise of his industrial and political
rights. The threat of the Socialist Party to repeal this Act is in itself a ground
for asking the support of the workers for the present Government.

1929 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:43
Agriculture

Our policy for agriculture have been consitently directed, and will continue
to be directed, to the relief of burdens, the finding of markets, the provision
of credit facilities, and the development of education and research.

We have crowned the Conservative policy of relieving the essential
equipment of agriculture from unfair burdens by the entire remission in
England and Wales of local rates on farm land and buildings and in Scotland
by an equivalent relief from rates. We have found it possible to advance our
programme by bringing this relief into immediate operation. We have thus
conferred upon the agricultual industry a benefit of not less than £2.5
millions for the year ending October 1, 1929, and nearly £5 millions in a full
year. The substantial rebates railway freight charges for certain agricultural
traffics which we have also secured by our de-rating scheme, and the special
grants made from the Road Fund towards the maintenance and improvement
of roads in rural areas, with consequent relief to local rates, are further
instances of the same policy of easing the burdens of agriculture.

We have endeavoured to improve the farmer's position by helping him to
reform the methods of marketing agricultural produce. We are surveying the
whole marketing system of the country. New methods of standardised
grading and packaging have been introduced and under the Agricultural
Produce (Grading and Marking) Act, 1928, agricultural products can now be
sold in standard grades under a National Mark. A most successful beginning
has been made in the application of the Mark to eggs and certain kinds of
fruit and vegetables. Provision has also been made for the marking of
imported foodstuffs in suitable cases.

The policy of preference to the home producer has been steadily pressed by
the Empire Marketing Board, and is already showing results. In order to give
a lead in this matter by direct Government example, we have decided that in
future only homefed beef shall be supplied to the Army, Air Force and Navy
in Home Ports during the six months October to March, and that during six
months after harvest 25 per cent. of the flour used for those services shall be
milled from home-grown wheat.

We have initiated a long called-for reform in the finance of British
agriculture by the Agricultural Credits Acts under which both long term and
short term credits are being provided; considerable advantage is already
being taken by the farming community of these provisions.

Large sums have been provided for improving the drainage of agricultural
land, and we propose to introduce legislation, based on the Report of the
recent Royal Commission, which should give a fresh stimulus to this work.

Recognising that arable farming has been specially affected by the
depression in agriculture, we have vigorously supported and developed the
infant sugar beet industry, with results which have already exercised a
marked influence on the prosperity of agriculture, particularly in the eastern
part of England.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1929/1929-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 15

1929 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:43

We have ensured throughout England and Wales that the minimum and
overtime rates of wages of agricultural workers prescribed under the
Agricultural Wages Act of 1924 are being paid, and where necessary we
have secured the enforcement of the Act through the medium of the Courts.

We have extended the facilities for Small Holdings both for renting and
purchase by easy instalments, including a new type of cottage holding, and
legislation has also been passed facilitating the provisino of allotments. We
also propose to afford the poublic in rural areas improved telephone
facilities. The radius from the nearest exchange within which a telephone is
provided without extra mileage charge will be extended from 1.5 to 2 miles.
Call offices will be provided at some 5,000 rural post offices which have at
present neither telegraph nor telephone facilities and at more than 1,000
tural railway stations. The electrification of rural areas will be greatly
facilitated by the transmission system provided under the Electricity Act.

Taken together these measures constitute a practical policy. They have
proved, and will increasingly prove, their value as a contribution to the re-
establishment of British agriculture. It is a policy which enables the costs of
production to be reduced and the marketing of agricultural produce to be
improved.

But such a policy must be assisted by all the resources of modern science
and skill. To this end we have greatly extended the provision for agricultural
education and research, and have directed the attention of teachers in the
elementary and secondary schools to the need for closer co-operation
between those schools and the industry of agriculture. The further extension
of this work will be one of our main cares.

We are utterly opposed both to nationalisation of the land and to bureaucratic
control, the policies of our Socialist and liberal opponents. We do not believe
that these expedients can ever overcome the difficulties confronting the
agricultural industry, or bring prosperity to those who live by the land.

Fisheries

We recognise the great importance of the fishing industry. We have given
and shall continue to give financial assistance towards all forms of research
beneficial to the industry, including the search for new fishing grounds and
the investigations now being conducted into the preservation of fish, its
transport and the use of by-products. A start has been made to develop the
fisk canning industry.

We are taking steps to help the herring and inshore fishermen by improving
harbour facilities, by lightening the burden of existing loans and by the

reduction of harbour dues.

Share-fishermen have been included in the National Health Insurance
scheme and can now qualify for the Contributory Old Age Pensions.

Social Reform

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1929/1929-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 15

1929 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:43

The Conservative Party regards the prosperity of trade and industry, not as
an end in itself, but as a means to improve the condition of the people.
During our tenure of office we have carried through a great programme of
social welfare and have thus prepared the ground for the further programme
which we now lay before the country.

Pensions

At the last election a promise was given that a Conservative Government, if
returned with an adequate majority, would complete the details of a
Contributory Scheme of pensions for widows, orphans and old people at an
earlier age, without the irritating enquiries and restrictions that had
accompanied the earlier scheme of pensions at 70, and would put this
scheme into operation as soon as practicable. That promise was fulfilled in
the first nine months of our career and already one and three-quarter million
persons have been awarded pensions and allowances under our Act.

Housing and the Problem of the Slums

We also promised special attention to the vigorous promotion of housing
schemes, and the 930,000 houses which have been built during our term of
office, providing accommodation for nearly four millions of people,
constitute a record in this respect in the the history of the world.

Realising that the most pressing need is for houses which can be let at lower
rents, we have reduced the subsidy which was keeping up prices, and this
measure has been so successful that since it was announced the average cost
of a non-parlour house has been reduced by no less than £1.12 shillings.
With this encouragement Local Authorities are now placing fresh contracts,
and we shall continue to urge them to build houses for the lower paid
workers until the shortage, which for this class still remains acute, is
completely overcome. Meanwhile, the success already achieved has made it
possible to attack with a new prospect of success the formidable problem of
the slums which has hitherto baffled all attempts to find a solution.

Plans for the improvement of the present procedure in slum clearance are far
advanced. The present basis of compensation to owners, the unfairness of
which has had a delaying effect, will be amended after consulation with the
various interests concerned. New powers will be given to local Authorities
in England and Wales, enabling them to undertake the re-conditioning of old
houses after acquisition and providing for an enlightened system of careful
and sympathetic management. Where improvement schemes of this kind are
carried out it will be possible so to control the tenancies as to put an end to
the exploitation of sub-tenants who occupy furnished or unfurnished rooms
and who are often in no position to protect themselves against undue
charges. The corresponding problem in Scotland will be dealt with by
measures adapted to the special conditions of that country.

Rent Restriction Acts

The continuance of these Acts in their present form has created hardship for
certain owners of small houses. But, whatever modifications may be made to
mitigate their difficulties, the protection afforded to tenants by these Acts
will not be removed until the shortage of houses has been overcome
sufficiently to warrant such a course.

Local Government

By the adjustment of financial relations between Local Authorities and the
Exchequer an increased national contribution will be directed to the places
mostly in need of it. Under the provisions of the scheme the vast majority of
ratepayers will gain materially.

Welfare of Mothers and Children

Under the present administration special attention has been given to mothers
and children. The network of ante-natal clinics and infant welfare centres has
been greatly extended, and largely owing to these measures infant mortality
has been reduced from 75 to 65 per 1,000 of the population. The provisions
of the local Government Act may be expected to facilitate further expansion
in those places where it is most needed by directing to them an increased
proportion of the Exchequer contributions to local expenditure.

We desire, however, that this expansion should be carried beyond the infant
welfare centres, whose work is chiefly concerned with children up to one
year old. The school medical service is now providing treatment every year
for half a million more school children than in 1924, but there is still a gap
between the work of this service and that of the infant welfare centres.
Existing agencies, such as nursery schools, have done much, and can do
more, to solve this problem, but the gap cannot be bridged by these means
alone. While encouraging these agencies, therefore, we shall also
immediately undertake a comprehensive enquiry into the best methods of
providing for the health and welfare of children between one and five years
of age.

Another enquiry is already being carried out into the causes of maternal
mortality, and it is expected that when completed it will throw fresh light
upon this grave and urgent problem. In the meanwhile, the Government have
come to the conclusion that the maternity benefit under the National Health
scheme might be more effectively utilised in the preservation of the health
and life of mothers, and they purpose to reorganise this provision so as to
ensure that proper and adequate midwifery and medical services shall be
available to them.

Finally, the national provision for child welfare needs to be completed by
measures designed to protect the interest of older children. Several
Committees appointed during our term of office have examined this question
and have recommended important reforms. One of our first measures in the
next Parliament will be a Bill to consolidate and improve the Acts relating to
children and young people, and to bring them into conformity with

1929 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:43
enlightened opinion.
Welfare of the Blind

Among the social services which affect only a limited number of the
population are the provisions made for the welfare of the Blind. Much has
been done to ease the lot of those who are thus afflicted, and many are now
enabled by special training to make at least a considerable contribution
towards their own support. Pensions are provided at the age of 50 for such as
have not sufficient means of their own to be independent, but since at that
age it is difficult, if not impossible, for a blind person to take advantage of
the training facilities provided, the Government have come to the conclusion
that pensions should be made available earlier in life, and if they should be
returned to power they will introduce legislation to make the pensionable
age 40 instead of 50.

Education

As at the last election, we are issuing a separate statement of our education
policy. In that statement we show the progress we have made in carrying out
the pledges we gave four years ago, and we renew those pledges. Further, we
place before the electors for the first time a complete and balanced scheme
of education which has behind it the support both of education reformers and
of the trades and industries of the country. This scheme, for which we shall
pass the necessary legislation, will offer to all our people the opportunity to
pursue a connected course of study from childhood to manhood, and will
give to each phase of education - primary, secondary, technical and
university - its proper place in one coherent structure. In this task we need
the co-operation of all types of schools and every kind of educational effort,
and we therefore pledge ourselves actively to seek an agreed settlement
which will enable provided and non-provided schools to work together for
the accomplishment of these reforms upon just terms of parnership. We
need, too, the speedy completion of the reconditioning of all defective
school premises in the interests of the children who attend them, and we
propose to bring forward a special measure for this purpose. We need,
finally, the services of a teaching profession enjoying security of
remuneration and professional prospects and we shall endeavour to complete
the work in this direction which has already been carried so far during the
past four years.

Civil Administration

The efficiency of our public administration is an essential factor in our
national well-being. The changes that have taken place during recent years
and the increase in the numbers of women employed have given rise to
many difficult problems affecting the Civil Service. We have decided that
the time has come when it should be make the subject of a comprehensive
enquiry by a Royal Commission.

Great War Pensioners

By the end of this year the country will have spent on Great War Pensions
£913 millions, a sum greater in amount than the combined expenditure of
France and Germany on the same object.

War pensioners have been relieved by the Government's action from any
anxiety that the rates of their pensions might be reduced owing to the fall in
the cost of living.

Four hundred thousand officers and men have been given security of
pensions for life by the policy of final award which is being, and will be,
steadily pursued. Altogether over 800,000 men and women have been made
secure in the possession of their war pensions.

Arrangements have been made whereby exceptional cases of all kinds can
and do receive pension beyond the seven years' time limit.

The household and the Family

Great as are the benefits conferred upon the community by the public social
services, the happiness of the individual depends primarily upon the
conditions of his home life. During the past four years there has been a
substantial improvement in those conditions. Over the working population as
a whole wage rates have risen slightly while there has been a marked fall in
the cost of living.

The reduction of 6d. in the standard rate of Income Tax, together with the
increase in the earned income allowance and in the rates of children's
allowances for income tax purposes, has effected a striking diminution in the
burden of direct taxation, especially in the case of the family man who is
dependent for his livelihood upon his own labours. In the sphere of indirect
taxation we have abolished altogether the Tea Duty which has been in
existence for 300 years, and by our rearrangement of the Sugar Duties, we
have effected a reduction of 1/4d. a Ib. in the price of sugar to the consumer,
and this reduction has been doubled in consequence of world market
conditions. But these contributions to a reduction in the cost of living are far
transcended by the general reduction which has taken place as a result of the
Government's policy in returning to the Gold Standard. During our term of
office wage rates over the working population as a whole have risen slightly
while the cost of living has fallen by 10 per cent. This fall is equivalent to a
reduction of £160 millions a year on the household budgets of the insured
wage earners of the national alone, and if it is applied to all wages, salaried,
old age pensions and war pensions, the increased purchasing power would
be the equivalent of £240 millions a year. It is not surprising that there has
been a remarkable growth in the savings and investments of the workers.

This growth in the material prosperity of the home has been accompanied by

a series of reforms in our legislation affecting family life. By these reforms,
such as the Acts relating to the Adoption of Children, the Guardianship of

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1929/1929-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 15

1929 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:43

Infants, Legitimacy and the Age of Marriage, we have sought especially to
improve the position of women and children.

Economy

It is the steady improvement in the resources and spending power of the
individual home which should form the main object of our national financial
policy. Our opponents in all their schemes to gain votes never count the cost
in cash or credit. Yet money is the measure of all that can be done. We are
told that immense new burdens are to be placed upon the direct taxpayer by
the Socialist Party, and formidable drains upon our credit will be made by
the Liberals. All this will simply be taken from the common stock, and the
saving power and economic energy of the country will be reduced
accordingly. We do not think that this is a time for imposing new and heavy
taxes and it is certainly most necessary to nourish by every means the
financial credit upon which the whole activity of industry and enterprise
depends. Instead of placing heavy new burdens upon the taxpayer, the
process of strict and steady economies in every branch of the public service
must continue to be pursued with the aim of lightening the public burdens
and leaving larger sums of money to fructify in the pockets of the people.
The large savings which we have made on armaments are already apparent,
and it is to be hoped that international agreements and further departmental
economies will continue this process in the new Parliament, provided always
that national safety is not jeopardised.

Peace Abroad

The promotion of peace and disarmament has been the prime object of our
foreign policy, and that policy has proved successful over the whole field of
foreign affiars. Under the guarantees given by the Treaty of Locarno,
security, on which peace depends, has been assured in Europe, and Germany
has entered the League of Nations. This security has been extended from
Europe to the whole world by the signature of the Kellogg Pact, under which
all nations have solemnly undertaken to renounce war as an instrument of
policy and so have assumed the obligation to settle international disputes by
peaceful means.

The improvement in the international situation wrought by these important
treaties leads us to look with confidence for an early advance towards
disarmament. We stand for the reduction and not merely the limitation of
armaments and in this field we have set a notable example.

Despite the emergence of the Royal Air Force as a third fighting service and
the additional defence responsibilities we have assumed for the Mandated
Territories, the combined strength of the three Services is today substantially
lower than the corresponding figure for the Navy and Army before the War.

Along with this reduction in fighting strength, we have progressively

reduced the cost of Imperial Defence, despite the considerable programmes
of replacement and rearmament in all three Services necessitated by modern

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1929/1929-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 15

1929 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:43

conditions. In 1929-30 the total estimated expenditure on Defence Services
shows a reduction of approximately £7.5 millions as compared with the
corresponding cost in 1924-25.

The development of the League of Nations is a cardinal principle of our
foreign policy. The importance attached by the present Government to the
work of the League is illustrated by the fact that Great Britain has been
continuously represented by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the
Council and in the Assembly of the League.

We welcome, as the fruit of this consistent policy, the advance recently made
at Geneva towards an international agreement for the reduction of
armaments and we greatly hope for a further advance in this direction on the
lines of the proposals fore-shadowed by the representatives of the United
States of America.

As in European and world politics, so also in the special affairs of the
Middle and Far East, we have shown our desire and our ability to settle
differences and promote friendly relations. In the case of both Turkey and
China, where we were confronted with special difficulties, our policy has
fully justified itself; it has re-established old friendships and afforded new
opportunities for British export trade.

We shall continue, in every sphere of foreign policy, to act in the closest
consultation and co-operation with the Governments of the Dominions. We
believe this to be essential if the unity of the Empire and its influence in the
councils of the world is to be maintained.

Finally, we stand for the scrupulous execution of all international
engagements, in accordance with the traditions of this country.

Conclusion

It is for the electors to judge, in the light of our past record, whether we have
not faithfully redeemed the promises which we made four and a half years
ago. We have striven consistently to build up industrial prosperity on sound
and permanent foundations, and to improve the social conditions of our
people. The results can be seen in the steady revival of trade, especially in
the great basic industries, and in the reduction in the cost of living. The
future destinies of the country rest in the hands of the electorate. I am
confident that, with the growth of the new spirit of co-operation in industry,
the present trade revival will make steady and even rapid progress, provided
that British industry is guaranteed a period of stable government and can
thus enjoy that confidence in the future without which trade recovery is
impossible. If, as I hope, the Conservative and Unionist Party is returned to
power with an independent majority, those conditions can be secured. The
alternatives are a Socialist Government with, or without, liberal support, or a
state of political chaos and uncertainty through the existence of three parties,
none of which has a clear majority over the other two. Either of these
contingencies would be disastrous to the welfare of industry and to the
welfare of the nation as a whole, and I ask the electorate once again to place

their confidence in our Party as the only one which can secure stable
conditions and ordered progress along sound and practical lines.

1924 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

Stanley Baldwin's Election Address

The Socialist minority Government have forced a rush election upon the
country not upon any great issue of principle, such as was submitted to you a
year ago, but on the plea that it was incompatible with their dignity to
tolerate any inquiry into their conduct in connection with the withdrawal of
the Campbell prosecution.

The Campbell Case

The admissions already extorted from Ministers in Parliament are sufficient
to convince any reasonable person that it was as a result of undue political
pressue that the Attorney-General withdrew a prosecution instituted on the
grave charge of inciting the troops to sedition and mutiny. The refusal to
allow any inquiry inevitably suggests that the result of such investigation
would only have been to emphasise the conclusions that the course of justice
had been deflected by partisan considerations and to increase the public
anxiety.

The Russian Treaty

There are, however, other considerations which may well have influenced
the Government in their decision to precipitate an election. Under pressure
from the same extremist section which reversed the considered action of the
Attorney-General in the Campbell case - and, indeed, at the same moment -
the Government, going back upon its own better judgement and upon the
assurances given by the Prime Minister in Parliament, hurriedly patched up a
makeshift Treaty with the Soviets which they now realise to be no less
indefensible and no less incapable of standing close scrutiny. Under that
Treaty the rightful claims of British subjects are whittled down to an
undefined extent, and Parliament is to be asked to commit itself in the eyes
of Russia and of the world, to the principle of guaranteeing that the British
taxpayer shall repay a Bolshevik loan, if the Bolsheviks, in accordance with
their principles and their practice, should fail to repay that loan.

Unemployment
By dissolving Parliament the Government are, no doubt, also hoping to

obscure their utter failure to deal with unemployment, or to make good the
boast that they possessed the only positive remedy for that most serious of

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1924/1924-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 7

1924 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:44

all problems of the day. The unemployment situation is as grave, if not
graver, than it was a year ago, and more economic policy of the present
Government, as distinguished from the measures initiated by ourselves and
carried on by our successors, has had time to take effect, unemployment has
steadily increased. At the end of September the unemployment figure was
180,000 higher than at the end of June, and is, I fear, still rising. In this
disquieting situation the Government have no remedy whatsoever to
propose, beyond mere palliatives or an increase of doles.

The folly committed by the Government of choosing such a time in order to
abolish the McKenna duties and Part 2 of the Safeguarding of Industries Act,
under which certain industries were rapidly expanding and giving increasing
employment, and the even greater folloy of wrecking the hopes of the rapid
expansion of Imperial trade which would have followed on the adoption of
the proposals of the Imperial Economic Conference, are now only too
clearly evident.

Safeguarding of industry

The Unionist Party would be unfaithful to its principles and to its duty if it
did not treat the task of grappling with the unemployment of our people and
with the serious condition of industry as a primary obligation. While a
general tariff is no part of our programme, we are determined to safeguard
the employment and standard of living of our people in any efficient industry
in which they are imperilled by unfair foreign compeition, by applying the
principle of the Safeguarding of Industries Act or by analogous measures.
Without such provision the carrying out of the policy embodied in the
Dawes Report, in itself desirable as calculated to secure German reparations
and to restore stable economic conditions in Europe, might only prove
disastrous to ourselves.

Economy

The burden of taxation weighs heavily upon industry and trade, diminishes
real wages, and in a variety of ways adds to the cost of living. To assist in
relieving the community of this burden, the most rigid economy in
administration is essential.

Juvenile Unemployment

Pending the restoration of trade, our duty will be to continue to take all the
special relief measures in our power to ease the situation. More particularly
do I feel that the grave problem of juvenile unemployement requires fuller
and more careful consideration than it has received from the present
Government.

Imperial Preference

The best hope of industrial revival lies, however, in my opinion, in the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1924/1924-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 7

1924 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:44

development of the resources and trade of the British Empire. The policy of
encouraging mutual trade in the Empire by measures of Imperial Preference,
and of using our finance to promote Empire Development and Empire
Settlement, is one of which we adhere, and which we shall steadily keep the
front.

Imperial Unity

To strengthen and develop the Empire by every possible means is, indeed,
the first and dominant item in our policy, believing, as we do, that only
through the fullest co-operation of the partner states of the British
Commonwealth can the common peace, security and prosperity of each and
all of us be assured.

We favour the progressive grant of constitutional liberties in every part of
the Empire where the capacity and loyalty of the people will make such
measures a benefit to themselves and a strngth to the Empire. But we are no
less determined to maintain the authority and the unity of the Empire against
factious and misguided agitation wherever it may asset itself.

Imperial Foreign Policy

The same principles must underly our policy in relation to the outside world.
The foreign policy of this country must be such as will comment itself to the
Dominions and must be carried on in closest consultation with their
Governments. We stand for the maintenance of the most friendly relations
with our Allies, for the re-establishment of a settled state of affairs in Europe
and for co-operation in all matters admitting common action with the United
States of America. The support and strngthening of the League of Nations on
practical fines should, in our opinion, continue to be a cardinal principle of
British foreign policy, subject always to the overriding consideration that we
cannot enter into any commitments involving issues of peace and war
without the concurrence of the Dominions which would inevitably be
affected by them.

Imperial Defence

The maintenance of our security at sea, on land and in the air is one of the
first duties of any Government, and the Unionist Party, if returned to power,
will have to examine afresh the position in which the defences of the Empire
have been left by the present Administration. While in favour of any
practical proposals for a general limitation of armaments, we shall have to
scrutinise carefully in conjunction with the Dominions, the far-reaching
commitments and implications of the scheme recently put forward at
Geneva.

Agriculture

I regard it as vital that the great basic industry of agriculture should be not

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1924/1924-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 7

1924 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:44

merely preserved, but restored to a more prosperous condition as an essential
balancing element in the economic and social life of the country. For a
permanent solution of the agricultural problem, a common agreement
between all parties is desirable; and the Unionist Party, if returned to power,
will summon a representative Conference in the hope of arriving at an
agreed policy by which the arable acreage may be maintained and regular
employment and adequate wages secured to the agricultural worker. The Act
for the regulation of wages, passed in the last session of Parliament, will be
maintained. Unionists can justly claim to have been instrumental in passing
this Act in a form more generally acceptable to all agriculturists.

e We shall continue to agricultural ratepayers the relief already given
during our previous tenure of office.

e We shall support the provision of agricultural credit for all forms of
efficient, co-operative enterprise.

¢ The interests of the Fishing Industry will not be neglected, and with
that object in view the provisino of further and extended credit
facilities in this direction will be the subject of enquiry.

¢ The interests of the Fishing Industry will not be neglected, and with
that object in view the provision of further and extended credit
facilities in this direction will be the subject of enquiry.

e We shall promote the provision of small and cottage holdings by
affording facilities for occupation and ownership, and will encourage
the allotment movement with reasonable security for holders.

e We shall seek to make available on easy terms to all cultivators the
results of the latest agricultural scientific research.

e We shall take all practical steps to ensure that imported foreign
foodstuffs should be sold as such.

¢ The further development of the sugar beet industry and rural industries
generally will receive particular consideration.

¢ Afforestation and land drainage will be developed and improved rural
transport promoted.

e We are opposed to land nationalisation, the taxation of land values,
and all schemes of spoliation.

In short, the purpose of our Party is to protect agriculturists from Socialistic

and bureaucratic tyranny, and to secure for them the just reward due to all
investment in the soil, whether it be of money, muscle, or brains.

Cost of Foodstuffs

The problem of the cost of foodstuffs is one which demands careful
investigation by a Royal Commission. The importance of any feasible
reduction in those costs in its effects, both directly upon the cost of living,
and indirectly upon our industrial position, is obvious.

Housing

Next to the problem of unemployment, the gravest of our domestic problems
still is the housing problem. The Unionist Act of 1923, under which no less

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1924/1924-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 7

1924 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:44

than 161,441 houses have been authorised by the Ministry of Health, has
demonstrated that it will produce all the houses for which labour and
materials are available with present methods of construction, and the best
tribute to its success is that the present Government by the first section of
their own Housing Act have prolonged its operation unchanged until the
year 1939.

Something more, however, is required if the rate of building is to be
materially increased, and houses are to be produced capable of being let at a
rent approaching that which can be afforded by the poorer classes. This end
can only be achieved by the employment of new materials and new methods
of construction. The Unionist Party, which was the first to recognise the
importance of this aspect of the problem, will, if returned to power, do
everything possible to foster and develop the various experiments which are
not being carried out in these directions, and will not hesitate, if it be
necessary, to lend financial aid to bring them to early fruition, recognising
that, in this way, and in this way alone, can the provision of the housing
accommodation so sorely needed be secured in a reasonable time.

Slum Improvement

The Unionist Party is, moreover, determined that side by side with the
provision of new houses, the improvement of the slums shall be taken in
hand. The conditions in large cities are such that new houses can only be
built at a considerable distance from the factories and other places of
business at which the occupants work. For many of them, migration into the
suburbs would be difficult, if not impossible, on account of the expense and
time that would be taken up in travelling to and from their work. It is,
therefore, urgently necessary that without waiting until the whole population
is rehoused, the standard of existing houses should be made to approximate
more nearly to modern ideas, and as soon as the present shortage of
accommodation has been sufficiently eased, steps will be taken to carry out
this reform.

Insurance for Old Age and Widows' Pensions

Soon after the resignation of the late Government in the early part of the
year, I appointed a Committee to investigate a comprehensive scheme of
Insurance to cover both Old Age and Widows' Pensions. The three principal
defects in the present Old Age Pension scheme are:

That it involves an investigation into the means of the

First: applicant.

That the pensino is reduced where the means exceed a certain
Second: annual sum, even though those means result from his own
thrift; and

Third: That the pension itself is inadequate in amount.

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1924/1924-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 7

1924 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:44

Most of the proposals for Widow's Pensions also include investigation and
supervision of a kind that would be a constant source of irritation and
annoyance to the widow. The Committee have come to the conclusion that
the only way of avoiding such investigation is, whilst conserving the present
rights of old age pensioners, to supplement them by a contributory scheme
which would enable the contributor to receive his old age pension at an
earlier age and a substantially larger amount. In the same system, provision
should be made for the widow with dependent children to receive her
pension as a right, for which payment has been made, instead of a dole or a
charity. Accordingly, they have caused exhaustive actuarial investigation to
be made, and although their labours are not yet completed, they are satisfied
that it will be possible to frame a workable scheme. It will be the task of a
Unionist Government, returned with an adequate majority, to complete the
details of the scheme, and to carry it into operation as soon as practicable.

Education

Believing that the object of any Education Policy should be the welfare of
the child rather than the forwarding of some plan of educational progress,
based on social theories, and keeping in mind that our immediate aim should
be to develop our existing national system on practical lines, and to link up
elementary education more closely with the various forms of advanced
study, so taht no child which can profit thereby shall be debarred from doing
so by reason of the inability of the parents to pay fees, we are in favour of
the carrying out of agreed schemes as between local Education Authorities
and the Board of Education which shall ensure, among other matters:

1. A progressive Reduction in the size of classes.

2. The improvement, or when necessary, the replacement of insanitary
schools.

3. The development of Central Schools and other forms of education
above the Elementary School stage, with an adequate supply in the
number of Secondary School places, and a corresponding increase in
the number of scholarships and free places, applicable to all advanced
courses.

4. The maintenance, by agreement between Local Education Authroties
and the Teachers, of such scales of salaries as will secure efficient
teachers and attract the best men and women to the profession. Such
scales, when they have been accepted by Local Education Authorities,
to be obligatory.

5. The systematic promotion of schemes of adult education under the
Local Education Authorities and the further development of all kinds
of technical education.

6. The maintenance of the rights of parents to have their children brought
up in the religion to which they are attached.

Women and Children

In addition to such questions as Housing and Widows' Pensions, there are

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1924/1924-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 7

1924 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM

certain other reforms affecting women and children that I desire to see
carried out. The Probationary system for dealing with offenders should be
developed; a Bill to amend the consolidate the Factory and Workshop Acts
should be passed; children born out of wedlock whose parents have
subsequently married should be legitimised, the law relating to separation
and maintenance orders should be amended; equal rights should be ensured
to women in the guardianship of children; adoption should be legalised, the
number of women police should be increased, and the penalties for criminal
assaults against women and children made adequate to the offence.

Ex-service Men

The Unionist Party, will not cease to safeguard and further the interest of
those who sacriced so much for their country in the Great War, or that of
their dependants. The proposals of the present Government for carrying out
the recommendatino of the Southborough Committee with regard to the
position of Temporary ex-Service Civil Servants will be carefully examined,
if we are returned to power, and our conclusions will be presented to
Parliament before any action is taken to put them into effect.

A Broad and National Policy

In conclusion, I would appeal to you to help to secure for the country, in this
difficult and anxious time, a strong and stable Government, based on an
independent majority in Parliament, resolved to maintain the existing
constitutional and economic liberties under which Britian has grown great
and prosperious, and empowered to solve on practical and commonsense
lines the urgent industrial and social problems of the day. The experiment of
a minority Government has proved a short-lived failure. But it has afforded
sufficient indication of what would be the character of a Socialist
Government dependent, not upon other Parties, but upon the extremist
section of its own majority, to make it imperative upon all who wish to see
the restoration of prosperity and social peace, to unite their efforts in
averting such a possibility. The only way in which that can be achieved lies
in the return of a solid Unionist majority. I appeal, therefore, to all men and
women who desire stable Government to support the broad and national
policy that I have outlined and to ensure the return of a House of Commons
that will have the will and power to carry it into effect.

1923 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

Stanley Baldwin's Election Address

In submitting myself to you for re-election, I propose frankly to put before
you the present situation as I see it, and the measures which in the opinion of
myself and my colleagues are necessary adequately to deal with it.

1. The unemployment and under-employment which our working people
and our great national industries are now facing for the fourth winter
in succession, on a scale unparalleled in our history, having created a
problem which calls urgently for a solution. Their indefinite
continuance threatens to impair permanently the trained skill and the
independent spirit of our workers, to disorganise the whole fabric of
industry and credit, and, by eating away the sources of revenue, to
undermine the very foundations of our national and municipal life.

2. In large measure this state of affairs is due to the political and
economic disorganisation of Europe consequent on the Great War. In
accordance with the policy affirmed by the Imperial Conference we
shall continue to devote every effort through the League of Nations
and by every other practical means, to the restoration of a true peace
in Europe. But that at the best must take time. A year ago Mr Bonar
Law could still hope that a more settled condition of affairs was in
prospect, absence of any modification of fiscal policy, of the ultimate
necessity of which he himself was always convinced. Since the
occupation of the Ruhr it has become evident that we are confronted
by a situation which, even if it does not become worse, is not likely to
be normal for years to come.

3. The disorganisation and poverty of Europe, accompanied by broken
exchanges and by higher tariffs all the world over, have directly and
indirectly narrowed the whole field of our foreign trade. In our own
home market the bounty given to the importation of foreign goods by
depreciated currencies, and by the reduced standard of living in many
European countries, has exposed us to a competition which is
essentially unfair and is paralysing enterprise and initiative. It is under
such conditions that we have to find work for a population which,
largely owing to the cessation during the war period of the normal
flow of migration to the Dominions, has in the last census period
increased by over a million and three quarter souls.

4. No Government with any sense of responsibility could continue to sit
with tied hands watching the unequal struggle of our industries or
content itself with palliatives which, valuable as they are to mitigate
the hardship to individuals, must inevitably add to the burden of rates

and taxes and thereby still further weaken our whole economic
structure. Drastic measures have become necessary for dealing with
present conditions as long as they continue.

. The present Government hold themselves pledged by Mr Bonar Law

not to make any fundamental change in the fiscal system of the
country without consulting the electorate. Convinced, as I am, that
only by such a change can a remedy be found, and that no partial
measures such as the extension of the Safeguarding of Industries Act,
can meet the situation, I am in honour bound to ask the people to
release us from this pledge without further prejudicing the situation by
any delay. That is the reason, and the only reason, which has made this
election necessary.

. What we propose to do for the assistance of employment in industry, if

the nation approves, is to impose duties on imported manufactured
goods, with the following objects:-
© to raise revenue by methods less unfair to our own home
production which at present bears the whole burden of local and
national taxation, including the cost of relieving unemployment.
© to give special assistance to industries which are suffering under
unfair foreign competition;
© to utilise these duties in order to negotiate for a reduction of
foreign tariffs in those directions which would most benefit our
export trade;
© to give substantial preference to the Empire on the whole range
of our duties with a view to promoting the continued extension
of the principle of mutual preference which has already done so
much for the expansion of our trade, and the development, in
co-operation with the other Governments of the Empire, of the
boundless resources of our common heritage.

. Such a policy will defend our industries during the present emergency

and will enable us, as more normal conditions return, to work
effectively to secure a greater measure of real Free Trade both within
the Empire and with foreign countries. Trade which is subject to the
arbitrary interference of every foreign tariff, and at the mercy of every
disturbance arising from the distractions of Europe, is in no sense free,
and is certainly not fair to our own people.

. It is not our intention, in any circumstances, to impose any duties on

wheat, flour, oats, meat (including bacon and ham), cheese, butter or
eggs.

. While assisting the manufacturing industries of the country we

propose also to give a direct measure of support to agriculture.
Agriculture is not only, in itself, the greatest and most important of our
national industries, but is of especial value as supplying the most
stable and essentially complementary home market for our
manufacturers.

We propose to afford this assistance by a bounty of £1 an acre on all
holdings of arable land exceeding one acre. The main object of that
bounty is to maintain employment on the land and so keep up the
wages of agricultural labour. In order to make sure of this we shall
decline to pay the bounty to any employer who pays less than 30/- a

week to an able-bodied labourer.

The exclusion from any import duties of the essential foodstuffs which
I have mentioned, as well as of raw materials, undoubtedly imposes a
certain limitation upon the fullest extension of Imperial Preference.
But even the preferences agreed to at the recent Economic Conference
within our existing fiscal system, have been acknowledged as of the
greatest value by the Dominion representatives, and our present
proposals will offer a much wider field, the value of which will be
progressively enhanced by the increasing range and variety of Empire
production.

Moreover in the field of Empire development, as well as in that of
home agriculture, we are not confined to the assistance furnished by
duties. We have already given an earnest of our desire to promote a
better distribution of the population of the Empire through the Empire
Settlement Act, and at the Economic Conference we have undertaken
to co-operate effectively with the Government of any part of the
Empire in schemes of economic development. More especially do we
intend to devote our attention to the development of cottom growing
within the Empire, in order to keep down the cost of a raw material
essential to our greatest exporting industry.

These measures constitute a single comprehensive and inter-dependent
policy. Without additional revenue we cannot assist agriculture at
home, but the income derived from the tariff will provide for this and
leave us with means which can be devoted to cotton growing and
other development in the Empire, and to the reduction of the duties on
tea and sugar which fall so directly upon the working class household.
For the present emergency, and pending the introduction of our more
extended proposals, we are making, and shall continue to make, every
effort to increase the volume of work for our people. The Government
are spending very large sums on every measure of emergency relief
that can help in this direction. Further, the local Authorities of all
kinds throughout the country, and great individual enterprises, such as
the railways, with the assistance of the Government, or on its
invitation, are co-operating wholeheartedly in the national endeavour
to increase the volume of employment. This great combined effort of
the Government, of the Local Authorities, and of individual
enterprises, represents an expenditure of no less than £100 millions
sterling.

The position of shipbuilding, one of the hardest hit of all our
industries, is peculiar. It can only recover as shipping revives with the
development of Empire and foreign trade which we believe will
follow from our measures. We propose in the meantime to give it
special assistance by accelerating the programme of light cruiser
construction which will in any case become necessary in the near
future. We are informed by our Naval advisers that some light cruisers
will be required during the next few years in replacement of the
County class, as well as a variety of smaller and auxiliary craft, and
we intend that a substantial proportion of these shall be laid down as
soon as the designs are ready and Parliamentary sanction secured.
The solution of the unemployment problem is the key to every

necessary social reform. But I should like to repeat my convictino that
we should aim aim at the reorganisatino of our various schemes of
insurance against old age, ill-health and unemployment. More
particularly should we devote our attention to investigating the
possibilities of getting rid of the inconsistencies and the
discouragement of thrift at present associated with the working of the
Old Age Pensions Act. The encouragement of thrift and independence
must be the underlying principle of all our social reforms.

1922 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

Andrew Bonar Law's Election Address

His Majesty has been graciously pleased to appoint me First Minister of the
Crown. I appeal to you to renew your confidence in myself as your
representative, and to give your support to the new Government of which I
am the head. The crisis which has arisen so suddenly has made it absolutely
necessary that an immediate appeal should be made to the people, and in
consequence it has been impossible to have an examination with my
colleagues into the many questions with which we have to deal. Of necessity,
therefore, the outlines of policy which I now submit to you cannot be as
definite and precide as in other circumstances would have been possible.

The crying need of the nation at this moment - a need which in my
judgement far exceeds any other - is that we should have tranquility and
stability both at home and abroad so that free scope should be given to the
initative and enterprise of our citizens, for it is in that way far more than by
any action of the Government that we can hope to recover from the
economic and social results of the war.

With this in view I think it is of the utmost importance that we should return
as quickly as possible, to the normal procedure which existed before the war.
In pursuance of this aim I am satisfied that the time has now come when a
change should be made in the machinery of the central Government. Some
of the work which has hitherto been done by the Cabinet Secretariat is
essential and must be continued, but we intend to bring that body in its
present form to an end, and I am certain that the necessary work can be
continued, and the invaluable services of the present Secretary retained, in
connection with the Treasury, which in the past has always been the central
department of Government. As an illustration of the changes which we
contemplate, instructions have been already given to transfer to the Foreign
Office the machinery of the League of Nations, and in the same way to
arrange, as regards any future International Conferences, that even where it
is necessary that I as Prime Minister should be present, the machinery of the
Conferences and the preliminary work in connection with them will be
performed not by the Cabinet Secretariat but by the Foreign Office itself.

At the present moment the first foreign interest not alone of Great Britain
and of the British Empire, but of the world, is the re-establishment of peace.
In all our foreign relations we intend to pursue an even course, loyally
fulfilling the obligations we have undertaken, but resolutely determined not
to extend our commitments, and should reasonable occasion arise to curtail

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1922/1922-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 3

them. It was by wholehearted co-operation, often under great difficulty, and
with great differences of opinion, that we won the war. It is only by the same
frank and full co-operation, conducted in the same spirit, with France and
our other great Allies, that we can hope to solve the difficult problems with
which we are not confronted. It is my confident hope that under the well-
tried guidance of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the negotiations
for the settlement of the Near Eastern crisis will result in a true and lasting
peace, conducing both to the political tranquillity of the Near and Middle
East, with which so many of our Imperial interests are bound up, and to the
personal security and happiness of the inhabitants of all races and creeds in
the regions which have been the scene of so much disturbance and suffering.

During the war the feeling supreme in the minds of men and women
throughout the world was that a similar calamity should never again be
allowed to fall upon mankind. It was to meet this feeling that the League of
Nations was instituted, and it will be our earnest aim to give it wholehearted
and practical support. The maintenance of our friendship and good
understanding with the United States, based not on any formal friendship
and good understanding with the United States, beased not on any formal
friendship and good understanding with the United States, beased not on any
formal alliance but on community of inherited ideals as well as on recent
comradeship in arms, must always be a princial aim of British policy. Above
all, we mean, in all matters affecting the external policy or security of the
Empire, to act in close and continuous consultation with the Governments of
the Dominions and of India in order to ensure that our policy shall keep fully
in view both the interests and sentiments of our fellow subjects overseas, and
at all times have behind it the moral support of the whole British
Commonwealth.

Our first task, if returned to power, will be the ratification of the Irish Treaty.
We are prepared to take our part in making good that Treaty, both in the
letter and in the spirit, and to co-operate with the Irish Government in the
new relationship within the Empire which the Treaty will have created. We
are equally pledged to safeguard the freedom of choice and the security of
the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland. We earnestly hope that
further progress will be made in dealing with the anarchy in the South, and
that both in the North and in the South it will be realised that the prosperity
of Ireland as a whole can only be achieved by good will between the
Governments and peoples of the two portions of that country. The position
of the innocent victims of recent disturbances is a matter of the gravest
concern to the people of this country, and it will be the duty of the
Government to keep in the closest touch with the Government of the Irish
Free State on this matter, so that just claims for compensation may have
sympathetic consideration.

We desire to promote the quiet and orderly development of India under the
constitution which was conferred on her by the Act of 1919. The co-
operation of all classes and sections is essential to the progress and
prosperity of India, and, if that be secured, we can look forward with
confidence to an industrial development which will add to her resources and
give increased stability to her economic structure.

1922 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:44

At home our chief preoccupation at this time is the state of trade and
employment. The immediate problem of unemployment this winter will call
for emergency measures. Plans for dealing with the situation have already
been considered by the late Government. They will be examined afresh by
us with a view of seeing whether any improvements are possible, and the
necessary steps will then be taken with the least avoidable delay. Such
remedies, however, can only be palliatives, and the real recovery will not
come except from the revival of trade and industry. To secure this result, the
first eessential is to reduce expenditure to the lowest attainable level in the
hope that the taxpayer may find some relief from the burden fo taxation
which not only presses so heavily upon individuals, but is the greatest clog
upon the wheels of national industry.

Every Candidate, in every constituency, will, as I do, make retrenchment an
essential part of his programme. All that I can possibly say, knowing how
great are the difficulties, is that we should do our best to secure it. It will also
be our endeavour in any way in our power to help trade, and the method of
doing this, which seems to me most helpful, is the development of trade
within the Empire itself. The markets, which for the time at least, as a
consequence of the war, we have lost in Europe, can best be replaced by
further development of trade with overseas countries, and especially of trade
within the British Empire. We propose, therefore, immediately to consult the
Governments of the self-governing Dominions and, if they approve, to
summon, as early as possible, an Economic Conference with the view of
finding in what way by mutual co-operation we can best develop the vast
trade of which, in my opinion, the resources of the Empire admit.

There is one branch of industry to which I must specially refer. As a
consequence of the war, agriculture, the greatest of our national industries, is
in a most serious condition, and demands the practical sympathy of the
Government. It is not easy to specify the exact method by which that
sympathy can be shown, but we shall immediately examine the whole
problem afresh in the hope of making proposals which will assist the
agricultural community to overcome the difficulties that now confront them.

There are many measures of legislative and administrative importance
which, in themselves, would be desirable, and which, in other electorate. But
I do not feel that they can, at this moment, claim precedence over the
nation's first need, which is, in every walk of life, to get on with its work
with the minimum of interference at home and of disturbance abroad.

1918 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

The Manifesto of Lloyd George and Bonar Law

The Coalition Government, supported by the strenuous and united labours of
the whole nation, has now accomplished the gravest portion of its task. Our
enemies have been defeated in the field, their armies are broke, and their
Governments are over-turned. Thanks to the patient valour of the hosts of
freedom, the knell of military autocracy has sounded forever in the
Continent of Europe. Other tasks directly arising out of the war now await
our nation, and can only be surmounted by the good sense, the patriotism,
and the forbearance of our people. The unity of the nation which has the
patriotism, and the forbearance of our people. The unity of the nation which
has been the great secret of our strength in war must not be relaxed if the
many anxious problems which the war has bequeathed to us are to be
handled with the insight, courage, and prompritude which the times demand.

As a preliminary to the soltuion of these problems it is essential that a fresh
Parliament should be summoned, possessed of the authority with a General
Election alone can give it, to make the peace of Europe and to deal with the
difficult transitional period which will follow the cessation of hostilities.
Indeed, the present Parliament has long outstayed its appointed term, and
meanwhile millions of new voters, including for the first time representatives
of the womanhood of the country, have been added to the electorate. It is
right that the Government, upon whom it devolves in conjunction with our
Dominions and our allies to settle the political future of Europe, should be
supported by the confidence of the vast body of newly enfranchised citizens.

We appeal, then, to every section of the electorate, without distinction of
party, to support the Coalition Government in the execution of a policy
devised in the interests of no particular class or section, but, so far as our
light serves us, for the furtherance of the general good. Our first task must be
to conclude a just and lasting peace, and so to establish the foundations of a
new Europe that occasion for further wars may be for ever averted. The
brilliant and conclusive triumph of the Allied Armies will, we hope, render it
possible to reduce the burden of our armaments and to release by successive
and progressive stages the labour and capital of the Empire for the arts of
peace. To avert a repetition of the horrors of war, which are aggravated by
the onward march of science, it will be the earnest endeavour of the
Coalition Government to promote the formatino of a League of Nations,
which may serve not only to ensure society against the calamitous results of
militarism but to further a fruitful mutual understanding between the
associated peoples. Never have the men and women of our race played so

great and commanding a part in the affairs of the whole world as during the
tempests and trials of this great war, and ever has the British name been so
widely honoured.

The care of the soldiers and sailors, officers and men, whose heroism has
won for us this great deliverance, and who return to civil life, is a primary
obligation of patriotism, and the Government will endeavour to assist such
members of the armed forces of the Crown as may desire to avail themselves
of facilities for special industrial training and to return to civil life under
conditions worthy of their services to the country. Plans have been prepared,
and will be put into execution as soon as the new Parliament assembles,
whereby it will be the duty of public authorities and, if necessary, of the
State itself to acquire land on simple and economical basis for men who
have served in the war, either for cottages with gardens, allotments, or small
holdings as the applicants may desire and be suited for, with frants provided
to assist in training and initial equipment. In addition to this, we intend to
secure and to promote the further development and cultivation of allotments
and small holdings generally so far as may be required in the public interest.

Increased production must necessarily be the basis of all schemes for the
improvement the conditions of the people. The war has revealed the extent
to which the resources of the country have been dissipated and depressed by
lack of organisation or by wasteful organisation. It has been demonstrated
that the land of the country, if properly cultivated and used, could have
yielded food and other products of the soil to a much larger extent. It must
be among the first tasks of the new Government to repair this error, which
added so much to our difficulties in our struggles against the submarines of
the enemy.

The war has given fresh impetus to agriculture. This must not be allowed to
expire. Scientific farming must be promoted, and the Government regard the
maintenance of a satisfactory agricultural wage, the improvement of village
life, and the development of rural industries as essential parts of an
agricultural policy. Arrangements have been made whereby extensive
afforestation and reclamation schemes may be entered upon without delay. A
systematic improvement in the transport facilities of the resources of the
soil, and the Government are preparing plans with a view to increasing these
facilities on a large scale.

The principal concern of every Government is the must be the condition of
the great mass of the people who live by manual toil. The steadfast spirit of
our workers, displayed on all the wide field of action opened out by the war -
in the trenches, on the ocean, in the air, in field, mine, and factory - has left
an imperishable mark on the heart and conscience of the nation. One of the
first tasks of the Government will be to deal on broad and comprehensive
lines with the housing of the people, which during the war has fallen so
sadly into arrears, and upon which the well-being of the nation so largely
depends. Larger opportunities for education, improved material conditions,
and the prevention of degrading stndards of employment; a proper adaption
to peace conditions of the experience which during the war we have gained
in regard to the traffic in drink - these are among the conditions of social

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1918/1918-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 4

1918 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:45

harmony which we shall earnestly endeavour to promote. It will be the
fundamental object of the Coalition to promote the unity and development of
our Empire and of the nations of which it is composed, to preserve for them
the position and influence and authority which they have gained by their
sacrifices and efforts in the cause of human liberty and progress, and to bring
into being such conditions of living for the inhabitants of the British Isles as
will secure plenty and opportunity to all.

Until the country has returned to normal industrial conditions it would be
premature to prescribe a fiscal policy intended for permanence. We must
endeavour to reduce the war debt in such a manner as may inflict the least
injury to industry and credit. The country will need all the food, all the raw
material, and all the creidt which it can obtain, and fresh taxes ought not to
be imposed on food or upon the raw materials of our industry. At the same
time a preference will be given to our Colonies upon existing duties and
upon any duties which, for our own purpose, may be subsequently imposed.
One of the lessons which has been most clearly taught us by the war is the
danger to the nation of being dependent upon other countries for vital
supplies on which the life of the nation may depend. It is the intention
therefore of the Government to preserve and maintain where necessary these
key industries in the way which experience and examinatino may prove to
be best adapted for the purpose. If production is to be maintained at the
highest limit at home, security must be given against the unfair competitino
to which our industries may be subjected by the dumping of goods produced
abroad and sold on our market below the actual cost of production. The
military institutions of the country must necessarily be dependent upon the
needs of the Empire and the prospective requirements of any League for the
preservation of peace to which this country may hereafter be a party.
Meanwhile it will be the aim of the Government to carry through the
inevitable reductions in our military and naval establishments with the least
possible suffering to individuals and to the best advantage of industry and
trade.

Active measures will be needed to secure employment for the workers of the
country. Industry will rightly claim to be liberated at the earliest possible
moment from Government control. By the development and control in the
best interest of the State of the economical production of power and light, of
the railways and the means of communication, by the improvement of the
Consular Service, and by the establishment of regular machinery for
consultation with representative trade and industrial organisations on matters
affecting their interest and prosperity, output will be increased, new markets
opened out, and great economies effected in industrial production.

It will be the duty of the new Government to remove all existing inequalities
of the law as between men and women.

It has been recognised by all parties that reform is urgently required in the
constitution of the House of Lords, and it will be one of the objects of the
Government to create a Second Chamber which will be based upon direct
contract with the people, and will therefore be representative enough
adequately to perform its functions.

1918 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:45

The people of this country are not unmindful of the conspicuous services
rendered by the Princes and people of India to the common cause of
civilisation during the war. The Cabinet has already defined in
unmistakeable language the goal of British policy in India to the
development of responsible government by gradual stages. To the general
terms of that declaration we adhere and propose to give effect.

Ireland is unhappily rent by contending forces, and the main body of Irish
opinion has seldom been more inflamed or less disposed to compromise than
it is at the present moment. So long as the Irish question remains unsettled
there can be no political peace either in the United Kingdom or in the
Empire, and we regard it as one of the first obligations of British
statesmanship to explore all practical paths towards the settlement of this
grave and difficult question on the basis of self-government. But there are
two paths which are closed - the one leading to a complete severance of
Ireland from the British Empire, and the other to the forcible submission of
the six counties of Ulster to a Home Rule Parliament against their will. In
imposing these two limitations we are only acting in accordance with the
declared views of all English political leaders.

It is a source of pride to be of this age, and to be members of this nation. In
the whole course of the world's history no generation has been compelled to
face sacrifices such as we have steadfastly endured, or perils such as we
have victoriously confronted. Well and truly have rich and poor, castle and
cottage, stood the ordeal of fire. Right earnestly do we trust that the united
temper, the quiet fortitude, the high and resolute patriotism of our nation
may be long preserved into the golden times of peace.

December 1910 Conservative Party
General Election Manifesto

Arthur Balfour's Election Address

In less than a year since the last General Election the Government has
resolved again to appeal to the country. They have selected the season at
which the register least accurately represents the constinuencies, and which
is most inconvenient to trade; and have done so without the excuse of a
Parliamentary defeat in either House, and with no visible breach in the
strange coalition of parties which keeps them in office.

It is in these circumstances that I ask you for the third time to honour me
with your suffrages. I have little to add to the detailed statment of my views,
which I sent to every elector for the City of London last December. Now, as
then, Tariff Reform, National Defence, and wider extension of freehold
ownership, Poor Law and other social reforms, are vital parts of the
programme, to which the party with which I am connected stands pledged.
Now, as then, we are resolved that the party of revolution shall not, under the
thin disguise of an attack on the Upper House, impair the liberties of the
people. Our principles on this last subject are plain, and we share them with
all the great men who have helped to develop our Constitution, or have been
concerned in framing free institutions for self-governing communities
beyond the limits of these islands. Nor would the Ministry, even in the
Parliament now drawing to a close, have obtained serious support for their
destructive policy were it not forced upon them by their Socialist and
Nationalist allies. It is because both Nationalists and Socialists are aware
that their darling projects are not in harmony with the considered will of the
people that they press for the abolition of the only Constitutional safeguard
which at critical moments will enable that will to prevail.

Behind the Single Chamber conspiracy lurk Socialism and Home Rule. The
alternative scheme of Reform which we desire to see adopted has, in spite of
the Government, now been brought to the notice of the country. It is true that
a full Parliamentary discussion of it has been made impossible by the date
selected for the Dissolution. It is also true that in consequence the
constituencies have not enjoyed that assistance in judging of its merits which
they had a right to demand. Yet I cannot doubt that if they fairly survey the
constructive programme which the Unionist Party offers them - fiscal, social,
Imperial, and Constitutional - they will feel that on these lines, and on these
lines only, is ordered progress possible.

January 1910 Conservative Party
General Election Manifesto

Arthur Balfour's Election Address

It is understood that Parliament will be dissolved early in 1910; and I shall
then solicit the renewal of the confidence which you bestowed on me in such
generous measure nearly four years ago. The immediate occasion of the
dissolution is the resolution of the House of Lords that the country should be
consulted upon the Budget proposals of 1909. The Budget, therefore, is the
subject primarily before the constituencies, and it might have been supposed
that the alternative methods of raising money necessary to meet the
obligations of the Treasury would have been the topic most deepy interesting
to Government. For motives not difficult to conjecture this does not seem to
be the case. It is not the merits of the Budget about which they are
concerned; it is that those merits should be submitted to the judgement of the
people and (bitterest of all) submitted at the instance of the Upper House.
There may be good reason for their irritation; but assuredly they are not
reasons drawn either from the letter or the spirit of the British Constitution;
nor are they based on those more general principles of government common
to representative institutions in the best types of modern democracy.

The claim of the Government, stripped of the bad history and bad law with
which it is obscured, is simplicity itself. They hold that the House of
Commons, no matter how elected, or when elected, nor matter what its
relation to public opinion of the moment, is to be the uncontrolled master of
the fortunes of every class in the community; and that to the community
itself no appeak, even in the extreme cases, is to be allowed to lie. The
question, be it noted, is not whether the Second Chamber may orignate
money Bills, for that has never been raised; nor whether they may amend
money Bills, for that has not been raised; nor raised are three

1. May there not be occastions on which an appeal to the people on
matters of finance is necessary?

2. Is not this one of them?

3. If these questions be answered in the affirmative, does any other
machinery exist for securing such an appeal than that which has been
set in motion by the House of Lords?

In the United States of America it is a fundamental principle of the
Constitution that no king of property shall be prejudiced by special taxation.
That Constitution is not easily changed; and before a measure like the
British Budget could be legally attempted the consent must be obtained of a

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1910/jan/january-1910-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 7

January 1910 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:46

two-thirds majority in both Houses, nor could any such measure become law
without a national mandate from a still stronger majority of the country.

If we suggest the impossible, and imagine these constitutional safeguards
withdraw, would the American taxpayer ever then be reduced to the
precarious position of his British brother. Far from it. Special taxation might,
indeed, by imposed by the House of Representatives, but it could be rejected
by the Senate, it could be vetoes by the President.

I do not ask the British citizen should enjoy the same security for his
property as the citizen of the United States. I am not so immoderate. I only
ask that if his property be subjected to exceptional taxation, by the caprice of
a Minister and his majority, he should not be deprived of the only methods
known to our Constitution by which an appeal to his fellow-countrymen may
possibly be secured.

The trust of the matter is that the present attack on the House of Lords is but
the culmination of a long-drawn conspiracy. The Government came into
office, not to work the Constitution of the country, but to destroy it. They
desire what is in effect a single Chamber Legislature. The Second Chamber
may be permitted to survive, partly changed so long as names remain the
same; partly to correct the legislative slips of the Lower House which, under
our existing system, are numerous, and I believe inevitable. But they desire
that for all important purposes the Constitution of Britain shall be as
definitely a single Chamber Constitution as the Constitution of Guatemala.
For this end they have continuously laboured. It is this policy which
represents the solitary thread of constitency connecting the wayward
legislative projects of the last four years.

I have watched with interest the progress of this conspiracy. Its results must
so far have disappinted the conspirators. On no single occasion when Bills
have been rejected by the Upper House or abandoned in the Lower on the
alleged grounds that they had been mutilated by the Lords, has the rising tide
of the Ministerial unpopularity shown the slightest pause or check. Then
came the Budget; and with it the opportunity of manoeuvring the House of
Lords into the positino of either abandoning its functions as a Second
Chamber or of taking action which might give new life and hope to the
contrievers of the single Chamber plot.

The scheme was ingenious. I do not thinkg it is proving successful. The
people of this country are not insulted by having their opinion asked on the
Budget, nor do they think that the House of Lords has gone beyond their
duty in asking for it. And they are surely right. For the single Chamber
system is not consistent with the democratic working of representative
Government in complex and developing communities. The representative
Assembly is no doubt the primary organ of the popular will, and it possesses
powers in this country which it certainly does not possess either in the
Republic of America or in the Republic of France. It determines without
appeal the political complexion of the Government. It controls all the
Estimates. In initiates all the taxes. In legislation it is the dominating partner.
The Ministers who direct, and sometimes tyrannize over, its deliberations,

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1910/jan/january-1910-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 7

January 1910 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:46

are nevertheless its creatures; and while no vote of the House of Lords could
reduce the salary of an Under-Secretary by a shilling, the most powerful
Cabinet must bow to the House of Commons.

These are great powers; in some respects they are, I believe, without
example. But they do not satisfy the single Chamber conspirators. And why?
Because they wish the House of Commons to be independent, not merely of
the Peers, but of the people.

Nor would there be grave objection to this if there was any security that the
action of the elected embodied on all great and far-reaching issues the
deliberate will of the electors. But there is not and cannot be any such
security. It is only by a transparent convention that we can, for example,
assume that a House of Commons returned on the cry of Chinese slavery
represents the mind of the nation on the question of Socialism. And the
convention, which is convenient and in many respects even necessary,
because not merely absurd, but perilous, when it is applied to questions of
fundamental importance, which have been but imperfectly discussed, which
are perhaps but imperfectly understood, which deeply affect individual rights
and social well-being.

In such cases there should be an appeal from the people's representatives to
the people themselves; and no machinery, however imperfect, for securing
this end should be abandoned until a better has been devised.

In any case the single Chamber system is impossible. And it is as impossible
in the region of finance as in any other. If finace meant in 1909 what it used
to mean in earlier days, the question would be unimportant. But directly the
need for money is used by a Government as an excuse for adopting the first
instalment of a Socialist Budget, for treating property not according to its
amount, but according to its origin, and for the vindictive attack on political
opponents, then the people have a right to be consulted; and that right could
never have been exercised had the Peers not used on behalf of the people the
powers entrusted to them by the Constitution.

If you ask me whether this constitutional machinery could not be improved,
either by some change in the composition of the House of Lords, or by the
institution of a Referendum, I am certainly not going even to suggest a
negative reply. The House of Lords as at present constituted contains, I
suppose, more men of first-class eminence in the business of law, of arms, of
literature, of science, and of finance, more men who have held great
administrative posts overseas, more men in daily touch with local business
than the House of Commons. Its debates on great occasions (for reasons in
no way derogatory to the Chamber in which I hope to spend all the working
days of my political life) are on a more even level of excellence. Nor would
it, I think, be wise to turn it into a second and rival House of Commons and
make it completely elective. But this does not mean that, even for its
comparatively subordiate, though all-important, constitutional functions, it
cannot be improved. Nor is any such opinion held by its most distinguished
members.

January 1910 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:46

But schemes of reform, however desirable, are but remotely connected with
the present issue. It is not so much the privileges of the Lords which are
threatened by the single Chamber plot, as the rights of the people. It is in
their interest that the plot must be defeated.

On the Budget itself I have already said so much elsewhere, that I need say
little now. I am interested in it chiefly as it affects security, and through
security the prosperity of the country and the employment of its people. For
here it touches the problems, or rather groups of problems, which lie at the
very heart and centre of social well-being.

I say groups of problems because unemployment is not a single disease, nor
can it be dealt with by a single remedy. It is as complex in its causes as it is
tragic in its results. A man may be unemployable through inherited defects
of body or mind, through evil training and surroundings, through illness,
accident, or age, through the slow deterioration which too often creeps over
those who have wasted hope and courage, not in the endeavour to do
something, but in the baffled search for something to do.

Again, a man through employable may be unemployed, either because he
and some willing employer do not get into touch, or because there is no
demand for the kind of work he is qualified to perform.

This brief statement is, of course, incomplete; but even as it stands it shows
how complicated is the social problem before us. It has long been evident
that it cannot be solved through the machinery of the existing Poor Law.
Since the Commission appointed by the late Government have reported, it
has become plain that the Poor Law machinery cannot even aid in its
solution. For every member of that Commission, Unionist and Radical,
offical and unofficial, Individualist and Socialist, agreed, after exhaustive
inquiries, that the machinery of the Poor Law must be 'scrapped'.

The task thus imposed upon us must be faced. But it is difficult, and in some
respects perilous. The sentimentalist and the doctrinaire, the man who
thinkgs that other people's misfortunes are part of an appointed order
requiring on his part the exercise of no virtue but resignation; the enthusiast
who is prepared to tax two men out of employment in order to compensate
one man for being unemployed - all these represent types of criticism which
in an unfavourable hour, may prove formidable to the best considered
schemes. In truth, this great and pressing reform requires caution as well as
courage. If we succeed, the amount of suffering which may be cured or
prevented is beyond computation. If we fail (but I think we shall not), we
may end by increasing the very ills we desire to remedy.

It is important, however, to observe that State-organised methods of dealing
with destitution, either by way of prevention or cure, can do little directly to
promote the market demand for labour. They may add to the labour supply -
as by turning the unemployable into the employable. They may render the

supply more available - as by the stablishment of labour exchanges. They

may increase the number of workmen weeking for employers, but they will
not increase the number of employers seeking for workmen. Yet, surely, this

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1910/jan/january-1910-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 7

January 1910 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:46

is at least as important an object as is the other. If the wise and humane
treatment of those who cannot support themselves belong to social
pathology, the encouragement of enterprise belongs to social hygiene. And
how from this point of view do the fiscal policies compare of Government
and Opposition?

The Budget, now waiting the sentence of the people, seems designed of set
purpose to make every man who has invested his money in this country
consider how he can remove it, and every man who is hesitating where to
invest it, determine to invest it abroad. The super-tax frightens some, the
new death duties cripple others, and worse then all, the origin of the
proposals and the principles on which they have been defended, show
clearly how thin is the dividing line which separates the policy of the
Government from that of the avowed Socialists.

Such is, and must be, the effect of the Budget and Budget speeches on the
mind of the investor. Very different are the results I anticipate from Tariff
Reform.

There are those who regard it as a paradox to say that Tariff Reform will
stimulate home industry. It seems to me a truism. Only by Tariff Reform can
you hope to retain colonial preference; only by Tariff Reform can you hope
to modify commercial treaties in your favour. Only by Tariff Reform can you
secure from unfair competition the home producer in the home market. It
will do him no injury in neutral markets, it may give him valuable aid in
protected markets. Is it credible, then, that it will not keep capital here that
would otherwise go abroad? Is it credible that, if it does, the demand for
labour will not increase?

On other aspects of Tariff Reform I will here say nothing. The very fact that
it is the first 'plank' in the Unionist programme has prevented it every
receiving less than its due need of attention, whether from friends or foe.

But some observation on land I must make; for on the subject of land no
absurdity in argument, and no folly in legislation, seems wholly ruled out of
court.

The Government began their career by loudly proclaiming the doctrine
known as 'Back to the land'. It might have been supposed, in these
circumstances, that they would have done their best to make the position of
the small cultivator as attractive as possible. Not at all. The life on the small
cultivator living solely on his holding is often a hard one - harder often than
that of the agricultural labourer. He is not within easy reach of the urban
amusements which attract so many, and in our climate the risks of weather
can neither be forgotten nor escaped. These are disadvantages. But there is
one great advantage of ownership. The hope of this may bring him to the
land. The enjoyment of it may keep him there. But it is just this that the
Government in their wisdom refuse to give him. They have some vague idea
that private ownership in land is a thing to be discouraged. They do not, I
gather, think it criminal, like Henry George. They do not argue, like the land
nationalists, that since 'the earth is the Lord's' therefore its rents should go to

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1910/jan/january-1910-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 7

January 1910 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:46

the Chancellor of the Exchequer. But they do apparently think ownership a
little discreditable except in the case of the Irish farmer. To make him a
proprietor, British credit may, indded, be lavishly employed. But a different
policy is good enough for Britain. Here the possession of land is treated
almost as an abuse. Those who indulge in it shall be made to pay: and
nothing shall be done to increase their number.

This being, so far as I can make out, their view, they insist that the small
holders should be tenants and (in England at least) tenants of a public body.
now there is not a farmer of sense in the whole of Great Britain who would
not reather be a tentant of Mr Lloyd George's favourite duke than of any
public authority from Caithness to Cornwall. Their whole way of looking at
the problem is illogical and absurd. If it be desirable that money should be
spent on the land with slight hopes of profit, property in land should not be
talked of as an abuse. If it be desirable that small cultivators should give
long hours of toil to the development of their holdings, the reward of
possession should be within their reach.

In this address I am compelled to restrict myself to broad constitutional
issues and certain great social and financial problems. I am thus perforce
constrained to be silent about the navy, but this is of the less importance, as I
have spoken more than once in the City upon this great theme since the
perilous position of the country first became evident earlier in the year. The
situation remains grave and the future is anxious. I do not think the public
will readily forget or forgive the lamentable negligence which so
dangerously encouraged the very rivalry in shipbuilding which they have so
often and, I doubt not, so sincerely deplored.

Here, then, I close what is not and cannot be more than an indication of
certain important portions of the policy which I trust our party will pursue.
To maintain the Empire, the Union and the Constitution, these are among the
traditional obligations of the party which gain rather than lose in force as
time goes on. But we have more to do than merely to preserve what we have
received. The world moves, new conditions arise, problems of Empire,
problems of trade, problems of national finance, problems of national
defence, problems of social amelioration meet us in forms not dreams of a
few years since. They must be solved each in its own appropriate way. But,
diverse as they are, it will, I think, be found that no substantial advance can
be made towards the solution of any one of them, till a change of
Government takes place, and a party is returned to office prepared to press
through to the utmost of its powers they policy of Tariff Reform.

1906 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

Arther Balfour's Election Address

The party with which I am connected, and the Government of which I was a
member, after being in power for ten years, has been replaced by the late
Opposition. The task the constituencies have now to perform is to choose
between them. It should not be a difficult one. So far as we are concerned
your information is ample; our legislation, our foreign policy, our Colonial
policy, are before you, and there are such as need cause neither shame in us
nor regret in you. The same principles on which we have based our actions
in the past will serve as their foundation in the future, and in the future as in
the paast they will promote peace among nations, closer union between
different portions of the Empire, and social legislation at home which is not
likely to be less beneficient to the community because it is mindful of
individual rights.

Your information about the new Government and its supporters is no doubt
more limited. You know them chiefly as critics, and it must be owned that
their criticism has been singularly unscrupulous - as in the case of Chinese
labour - and sometimes singularly perverse - as in the case of the Prime
Minister's famour attack on the humanity of our Army. But, after all, we are
not restricted in our survey to the performances of his Majesty's present
advisers while they were in Opposition. Some of the most distinguished of
them have held office before, and as they boast an unrepentant fidelity to the
views which they entertained in 1892, we must anticipate a return to the
policy they then attempted, but were fortunately too feeble to accomplish.
There are many things still obscure in the long catalogue of revolutionary
changes advocated by the new Ministers, but some things are plain enough -
Home Rule, disestablishment, the destruction of voluntary schools, and the
spoliation of the license-holder have lost none of their ancient charm in the
eyes of Radical law-makers, and to the troupe of old acquaintances is now
added a procession of shadowy suggestions respecting which we hardly yet
know enough to say whether they are dangerous or merely useless.

On one subject only does change, nay, even to hint of change, seem to them
abhorrent. With a light heart the Radical leaders are prepared to destroy the
Union, to uproot an ancient Church, to banish denominational religion, or
even all religion, from the elementary schools. But one thing is sacred, and
that is the fiscal practice of this country. The conditions of international trade
may alter, the relation of Britain to other industrial communities may be
utterly transformed, her Colonies may press for closer commercial union
with the mother country - it matters not at all. The fiscal creed of the new

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1906/1906-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 3

1906 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:47

Radical is that what was good 60 years ago must not only be good now, but
must for ever be incapable of improvement. I take a more conservative view.
I believe in the wisdom of adapting our policy, in fiscal matters as in all
matters, to the changing conditions of a changing world, and I hold that the
time has come when such adapting is urgently required. Should you return
the Unionist party to power, it is to the reform of our fiscal system that its
attention ought first to be directed - a task worthy of the efforts of a great

party.

To the foreign policy of the new Government we might seem justified in
looking with more satisfaction than to its legislative projects, for apparently
it is designed to be a continuation of our own. But, confident as I am of the
capacity and patriotism of Sir Edward Grey, I doubt the successor his
imitation. A foreign policy which is to be pacific, honourable, and consistent,
requires not merely a Foreign Minister of ability, but a Foreign Minister who
has two conditions in his favour. The first is a strong defensive naval and
military force, without which diplomacy in time of serious stress degenerates
either into buff, or into appeals for mercy, or into a haggle over blackmail.
Whether this condition will be fulfilled some recent utterances of the Prime
Minister leave me in anxious doubt. But there is a second and not less
important condition of success whcih the new Foreign Secretary cannot hope
to secure, and that is the support of a united Cabinet dependent on a United
Party. On their legislation the Ministers may have come to some working
agreement - time will show - but no agreement on the unforeseen problems
of international statesmanship is possible among men who will look at them
when they arise from such different points of view as those of the ""Little
Englander"" and ""Liberal Imperialists"". But the differences in the Cabinet,
serious as in this connexion they cannot fail to be, are nothing compared
with the differences which divide the confederation of parties on which the
Cabinet depends. In Imperial matters the gulf which divides, say, Mr Perks
from Mr Redmond is immeasurable; no formula can conceal it, no
compromise can bridge it; and if the new Government survive the general
election, and if during their term of office their country becomes involved in
international difficulties, the Foreign Secretary may find himself labouring
under conditions which are favourable neither to his own fame nor his
country's welfare.

Such, in brief outline, are the public grounds on which I venture to
recommend my candidature to your favourable consideration. Other grounds
there are - ancient friendship, mutual confidence, long habits of loyal co-
operation - to which I might make appearl; but if the personal side of the
question is to be touched at all, I have, perhaps no right to do more than ask
whether, during the 20 years in which you have extended to me an
ungrudging support, I have not done political service which may make me
not unworthy of your continued confidence.

1900 Conservative Party General
Election Manifesto

The manifesto of the Marquess of Salisbury

On the eve of the dissolution I take the liberty of recalling to your minds the
considerations which, in my judgement, should weigh with you in the
exercise of your rights as voters during the next few weeks.

The one object you should have in view is to bring about, to the utmost of
your power, by the exercise of your vote, the result you desire to attain. This
counsel seems a truism; but it is nevertheless tolerably evident that, if the
elections fail to produce a Parliament fitted to deal with the emergency of the
time, it can only be because the truism is neglected.

In the forecast of competent prophets we are threatened with many
abstentions. These abstentions will be due to one or two causes. Either the
candidate whom the voter prefers upon broad issues of policy differs from
him as to some subordinate question on which he has set his heart, or the
voter is convinced that his friend will succeed without his troubling himself
to give a vote.

It is obvious that if these causes of abstention operate in a sufficient number
of instances they will imperil a considerable number of seats; and no man
can know how many of his fellow-electors are disposed, by imitating it, to
give to his conduct its natural result.

If they are many the majority of the winning party will be reduced; and it
will be so far crippled in carrying out the policy on which the nation has
decided. Whose purpose will this result have served?

It is certainly not the result the abstaining voter desires. He will not be one
whit nearer his ideals in respect to various sectional objects in regard to
which independent electoral combinations have been proposed. On the fate
of these questions the election that is pending will have left no trace; and the
abstention of the abstaining elector will have been without effect. But on the
broad questions of policy the electors abstaining from whatever cause,
whether from resentment on a subordinate question or from indolent over-
confidence, will have a formidable influence. They will have contributed
within the limits of their ability to weaken the Parlimentary force of the
Unionist party, and of the Unionist Government to whom power may be
entrusted.

The gravest questions must be dealt with. The Imperial Power over the

http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1900/1900-conservative-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 3

1900 Conservative Party Manifesto - CONSERVATIVEMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 12:47

territories of the two South African Republics, which, as events have proved,
was unwisely relinquished, must be rebuilt upon durable foundations.

In due time those territories will doubtless enjoy the benignant colonial
policy which this country has pursued for half a century, and whose brilliant
fruit may be discerned in the affection that so many of our colonies have
displayed to the mother country during the recent war.

How long an interval must elapse before the full position of a British colony
can be attained by these South African territories will naturally depend on
the disposition and conduct of the inhabitants. But we cannot expect to
secure the steady submission of those whom we have overcome in the field,
unless they see that the Government of the Queen has so much
Parliamentary strength that there is no hope of driving it from its policy of
persistent resisteance or agitation. All the recent troubles of South Africa
have come from a shift of Parliamentary opinion at a crucial moment.

The brilliant success of Lord Roberts and his Army must not blind us to the
fact that the war has disclosed imperfrections in our own armour of defence
which, but for it, might have remained unnoticed. It will be among the most
urgent duties of Parliament and the Government, now that peace is
apparently restored, to investigate and remove the defects our military
system in the light of scientific progress and the experience of other Powers.
But for such a task a Government will need strong Parliamentary support.
Some may think, though I should not agree with them, that the task might be
as effectively performed by our opponents, if any possessed an adequate
majority and a party organisation capable of sustaining the burden of
government. But it certainly could not be discharged by a nearly divided
House of Commons and a Ministry depending upon a broken party.

To the difficulties which will occupy a future Government China will furnish
an abundant contribution. We will fully shared with other Powers that
calamities by which the disturbances in that Empire have been commenced;
and we are probably more interested than any other nation in the
preservation of the treaty rights which protect our commerce. The fact that
we are acting with other Powers forbids me from entering without reserve
upon questions of Chinese policy. But in maintaining our own rights, and
joining in the efforts of our allies to restore and secure tranquillity, we shall
be approaching a task of which it is difficult to overrate the complexity.

I earnestly trust that the electors, in confiding the solution of this and the
other problems I have mentioned to the party which is victorious at the polls,
will remember that, unless the party is armed with a strong majority in the
House of Commons, it will lack the authority at home and abroad which is
essential to the performance of its task.

For the last three and a half years, this country has felt trapped, like a lion in a cage. We have
all shared the same frustration — like some super-green supercar blocked in the traffic. We
can see the way ahead. We know where we want to go — and we know why we are stuck.

We have been paralysed by a broken
Parliament that simply refuses to deliver
Brexit. And that is why this election is so
essential.

Get Brexit done - and we end the division
and deadlock that have been so bad for our
politics.

Get Brexit done - and we restore
confidence and certainty to businesses and
families.

Get Brexit done - and we will see a pent-up
tidal wave of investment into our country.

Get Brexit done - and we can focus on the
priorities of the British people, funding the
NHS and tackling the cost of living.

Get Brexit done - and we can release that
lion from its cage and take this amazing
country forwards.

Andas things stand, there is only one way
to get Brexit done - and that is to return a
Conservative Government with a working
majority on December 12th.

lam very proud of the achievements of this
Government in its first 100 days. We have
mapped out a fantastic programme for the

years ahead: to unite and level up, spreading
opportunity across the whole United
Kingdom.

The UK has extraordinary advantages. We
lead the world in 21st-century technologies,
from batteries to bioscience. We have
many of the best universities on earth.
There are parts of this country that are
more productive and more innovative than
anywhere else in Europe.

And yet there are parts of the country

that feel left behind. Talent and genius

are uniformly distributed throughout the
country. Opportunity is not. Now is the time
to close that gap — not just because it makes
such obvious economic sense, but for the
sake of simple social justice.

We Conservatives believe passionately that
every child should have the same opportunity
to express their talents and make the most of
their lives — and that is why we are investing
£14 billion over three years to increase funding
for every primary and every secondary school
pupil in the country.

| want everyone to have the fundamental
security that comes from safe streets and
safe neighbourhoods — so we are backing our
police, putting 20,000 more officers on the

streets, and giving them the powers to tackle
crime with stop and search.

Everyone in the UK should have the peace
of mind and confidence that come from
world-class health care — and so this new
One Nation Conservative Government

is giving the NHS its biggest ever cash
boost, with 20 hospital upgrades and 40
new hospitals, while delivering 50,000

more nurses and 6,000 more doctors and
creating an extra 50 million general practice
appointments a year.

lf this Conservative Government is returned
to office, we will have an infrastructure
revolution for this country. Now is the time
to invest in Northern Powerhouse Rail, and
the Midlands Rail Hub, and so many more
projects, as well as a massive programme
of improvements for our roads and gigabit
broadband for every home and business.

We will invest in technology and innovation.
And we will invest in Britain’s people by
giving them the tools and training to
flourish in the economy of the 21st century.

We are the only party that can deliver this
programme, because we are the only party
that understands the balance and symmetry
at the heart of the UK economy.

We believe in superb public services and
infrastructure, not just because they are good
things in themselves, but because they are the
bedrock of a dynamic free market economy.

And there is only one way to pay for
world-class health care and outstanding
infrastructure — and that is to foster and
encourage the millions of British businesses,
large and small, that create the wealth of
the nation. Their success is our success. It is
thanks to the innovations of British battery-
makers and turbine designers that we are
able to cut CO2 - and achieve our goal of
being carbon neutral by 2050.

It is precisely because we understand the
concept of aspiration, and enterprise, that
the UK is now leading a new green industrial
revolution.

The tragedy of the modern Labour Party
under Jeremy Corbyn is that they detest the
profit motive so viscerally — and would raise
taxes so wantonly — that they would destroy
the very basis of this country's prosperity.

If you want to understand the impact of a
Corbyn Government on ordinary people,
remember that he has voted against tax
cuts worth £7,800 for people on modest
incomes. He is already committed to
putting up corporation tax to one of the
highest levels in Europe.

And what will he do for an encore? Embark
ona spending and borrowing spree that
would cost every taxpayer £2,400 a year,

as well as confiscating 10 per cent of the
value of our most prominent businesses and
putting those assets in the hands of John
McDonnell. What madness.

Wewill run an ever stronger and more
dynamic economy.

We will defend and protect our United
Kingdom - the awesome foursome that
make up the most successful political
partnership in history.

We are proud of our Armed Forces, and will
always fund them properly.

Jeremy Corbyn is prepared to break up the
UK, to disband the Armed Forces, and even
when it comes to cold-blooded murder

on British soil, he cannot stand up for our
country and do what is right.

We will stand up for our country and our
values around the world.

Above all, we Conservatives will respect the
democratic will of the people. After three
anda half years of procrastination, we have
a great new deal that is ready to go - so that
we will be finally out of the EU by January 31.

We are able to deliver all the advantages
of leaving the EU: making our own laws,
controlling our own borders, taking back
our money, and exercising all kinds of new
freedoms.

From freeports to free trade deals, from
abolishing the cruel live shipment of
animals to cutting VAT on tampons, we in
the UK will be able to remain close to our
European friends and partners; but where
we choose, we will be able to do things
differently and better.

With a new Parliament and a sensible majority
Government, we can get that deal through

in days. It is oven-ready - and every single
Conservative candidate at this election, all 635
of them, have pledged to vote for this deal as
soon as Parliament returns.

And what is Jeremy Corbyr’s alternative? A
new negotiation, and then a new referendum
-and he still cannot tell us what side he would
be on: in or out, Remain or Leave.

It is a recipe for chaos - compounded by
asecond referendum on Scotland. This
country has had enough of dither and delay,
of defeatism and despair.

We don't want to waste 2020 on two
acrimonious referendums. We want next
year to be a year of hope, of prosperity and
growth.

We want to move on, with our programme of
investment in education, infrastructure and
technology, to create a high-wage, high-skill,
low-tax economy.

We want to get Brexit done so that we can
get on with our work of making Britain the
greatest place in the world to live, to go to
school, to start a family, to own a home, to
start a business — with the most ambitious
environmental programme of any country
on earth.

Let's get Brexit done, and take this country
forward.

Boris Johnson
Prime Minister

 

 

Get Brexit Done

When the new Government entered Downing Street, the Prime Minister made a simple
promise: to get Brexit done. Many said it would be impossible. But he swiftly negotiated a
great new deal — despite Parliament's best efforts to block his progress.

And then, when he put it to MPs, they insisted on yet more delay.

We must move on. No more renegotiations. No more referendums. Every week is costing us.
Investment is waiting to come into the country. Families and businesses cannot make vital
decisions. The public services cannot get the attention they deserve.

Our priority as Conservatives is to get
Brexit done — so that we can unleash
the potential of this great country. So
that we can push past the obstacles
that other parties have put in our
country’s way. So that we can deliver
on the people’s decision in 2016 and
use our new post-Brexit freedoms to
transform the UK for the better by
focusing on your priorities.

If we elect a majority of Conservative
MPs to Parliament, we will start
putting our deal through Parliament
before Christmas and we will leave the
European Union in January.

Boris Johnson’s new deal takes the whole
country out of the EU as one United
Kingdom. It takes us out of the customs
union, allowing us to set our own tariffs
and do our own trade deals. It allows us to
pass our own laws and ensures that it is
our courts that enforce them.

Our deal is the only one on the table. It

is signed, sealed and ready. It puts the
whole country ona path to a new free
trade agreement with the EU. This will be
anew relationship based on free trade
and friendly cooperation, not on the EU’s
treaties or EU law. There will be no political
alignment with the EU. We will keep the
UK out of the single market, out of any
form of customs union, and end the role
of the European Court of Justice.

This future relationship will be one that
allows us to:

> Take back control of our laws.

> Take back control of our money.
> Control our own trade policy.
»

Introduce an Australian-style points-
based immigration system.

> Raise standards in areas like workers’

rights, animal welfare, agriculture and

the environment.

> Ensure we are in full control of our
fishing waters.

We will negotiate a trade agreement next
year — one that will strengthen our Union —
and we will not extend the implementation
period beyond December 2020. In parallel,
we will legislate to ensure high standards of
workers rights, environmental protection
and consumer rights.

The only way to deliver Brexit is with a
Conservative majority in Parliament. A
vote for any other party or candidate is a
vote for Jeremy Corbyn — and a vote for
more chaos.

 

Unleash Britain’s
Potential

For the past nine years, the Conservatives have been cleaning up Labour’s mess. Because
of the tough decisions that our party made and our success in bringing down the deficit,
the economy has continued to grow and the public finances have been restored. Thanks to
Conservative policies, employment is at a near-record high.

We've helped millions of people into
work, halving the unemployment rate.
We've doubled the personal allowance
to £12,500, meaning that every worker
gets to keep more of what they earn.
We've introduced and consistently
raised the National Living Wage — and
will raise it still further.

The strength of the UK’s balance sheet
— the hard work done by all of us in this
country — means that we are now ina
position to invest properly in our future.

A Conservative Government will give the
public services the resources they need,
supporting our hospitals, our schools
and our police. We will help people

and families throughout their lives by
bringing down the cost of living and
making sure that work always pays.

We will keep costs down for small
businesses — rather than hiking their
taxes and crushing Britain's prosperity.

We will not borrow to fund day-to-day
spending, but will invest thoughtfully
and responsibly in infrastructure right
across our country in order to increase
productivity and wages. Our fiscal rules
mean that public sector net investment
will not average more than 3 per cent of
GDP, and that if debt interest reaches 6
per cent of revenue, we will reassess our
plans to keep debt under control.

This means that debt will be lower at

the end of the Parliament — rather than
spiralling out of control under Labour.
And we will use this investment prudently
and strategically to level up every part of
the United Kingdom, while strengthening
the ties that bind it together.

We will also prioritise the environment
in the next Budget, investing in the
infrastructure, science and research that
will deliver economic growth, not just
through the 2020s, but for decades to
come.

Above all, we will listen to the people

who have felt left behind by the last few
decades of economic growth and want to
have more control of their future.

We will get Brexit done, so we can
unleash Britain’s potential.

NHS Trust

 

We Will Focus On
Your Priorities

In his first months in office, the Prime Minister has shown how he intends to make life better
for everyone in the UK. Supporting our police. Increasing funding for our schools. Building

new hospitals.

We have listened to you, and we have acted. Acted to ensure that we deliver world-class
public services so that you can have the help and support you need throughout your life. And
we want to take that agenda further.

But none of it will happen without a Conservative majority Government.

Strengthen the
NHS and social
care

The NHS represents the best of this
country. It is there for us when our
children are born, when our friends
and families fall sick, when our loved

ones succumb to old age and ill health.

It is precious to all of us — especially
because it is free at the point of use and
there for you on the basis of need, not
your ability to pay.

We as Conservatives believe passionately
in the NHS. Because we believe that
everyone deserves the chance to live free
of sickness and disease — and to know
that if they do fall ill, our brilliant NHS
staff will be there for them.

We are proud that since its foundation, it
is the Conservative Party that has acted
as the steward and guardian of the NHS
and its principles for 44 of its 71 years. We
are proud that it is coping with increasing
demand, with more doctors and nurses,
and using more advanced treatments
than ever before.

And we are proud to have confirmed a
record £34 billion per year by the end

of the Parliament in additional funding
for the NHS — and to have begun work

on building 40 new hospitals across the
country, as well as investing in hospital
upgrades and new machines to boost early
cancer diagnosis across 78 hospital trusts.

But we want to do more.

Within the first three months of our

new term, we will enshrine in law our
fully funded, long-term NHS plan. This
is the largest cash settlement in NHS
history. One that is only possible because

we have delivered the growth and
prosperity to pay for world-class public
services — and will continue to do so.

Between 2018 and 2023, we will have
raised funding for the NHS by 29 per
cent. By the end of the Parliament, that
will be more than £650 million extra

a week. And we will ensure this money
goes to the frontline so that you and
your family get appointments more
quickly and experience improved care.

We believe that the best way to improve
the NHS and meet rising demand is to
invest in its most important asset — its
people. That is why we are devoting
additional funding, on top of our existing

record settlement, to hire and support
more doctors, nurses and other health
professionals.

We will build and fund 40 new
hospitals over the next 10 years. This
is on top of the 20 hospital upgrades
announced in the summer. We will
roll out cancer diagnostic machines
across 78 hospital trusts to boost
early diagnosis. We are committed to
reducing health inequality. We will
continue to repair the damage done
by Labour’s disastrous PFI deals.

We will invest in preventing disease
as well as curing it. We will tackle the

 

Our NHS People Plan

The 1.4 million dedicated staff who
deliver world-class care day in, day out
are at the heart of the NHS. Our core
priority is to make sure this workforce
can grow and has the support it needs
—interms of numbers, training and
resources. That means that if you do fall
ill, you'll get the care and attention you
deserve.

their childcare costs.

those from overseas who want to work
in and support our NHS are encouraged
to do so. That is why qualified doctors,
nurses and allied health professionals
with a job offer from the NHS, who have
been trained to a recognised standard,
and who have good working English, will
be offered fast-track entry, reduced visa

We also want to make sure that
doctors spend as much time as
possible treating patients, so we will
address the ‘taper problem’ in doctors
pensions, which causes many to turn
down extra shifts for fear of high tax
bills. Within our first 30 days, we will
hold an urgent review, working with
the British Medical Association and
Academy of Medical Royal Colleges to
solve the problem.

strategy for empowering people with
lifestyle-related conditions such as
obesity to live healthier lives, as well
as tackling childhood obesity, heart
disease and diabetes. We will continue
to promote the uptake of vaccines
via our national vaccination strategy.
We will extend social prescribing

and expand the new National
Academy of Social Prescribing. We

will overhaul NHS screening and use
new technology and mobile screening
services to prevent ill health. We

will focus on helping patients with
multiple conditions to have simplified
and more joined-up access to the
NHS. And we will improve hospital
food alongside our wider National Food
Strategy.

We will develop new treatments for
serious diseases. We will extend the
successful Cancer Drugs Fund into
an Innovative Medicines Fund so that
doctors can use the most advanced,
life-saving treatments for conditions

such as cancer or autoimmune disease,
or for children with other rare diseases.
If you or a loved one is unlucky enough
to fall ill, we'll ensure you have access
to the best available medicines. We will
also improve the early diagnosis and
treatment of all major conditions.

We will treat mental health with the
same urgency as physical health. We
will legislate so that patients suffering
from mental health conditions,
including anxiety or depression, have
greater control over their treatment
and receive the dignity and respect
they deserve.

We will make it easier for people
with learning disabilities and autism
to be discharged from hospital and
improve how they are treated in law.

We will continue to take action to
tackle gambling addiction.

We will improve NHS performance,
using our record funding settlement

to bring down operating waiting times,
improve A&E performance and increase
cancer survival rates. We will study
carefully the recommendations of the
ongoing review led by NHS clinical staff
into A&E and clinical performance.

Weill use frontline technology to
improve patients’ experience, provide
flexible working for clinicians, and help
save lives. We will also hold an annual

health technology summit.

We will support our precious
hospices, developing the plans already
announced by Boris Johnson to secure
their future, with a £25 million cash
injection in August to support 200,000
people at the end of their lives.

We will make the NHS the best place
in the world to give birth through
personalised, high-quality support.
And we'll uphold our commitment to
extend healthy life expectancy by
five years by 2035.

We will end unfair hospital car parking
charges by making parking free for
those in greatest need, including
disabled people, frequent outpatient
attenders, parents of sick children
staying overnight and staff working
night shifts. This will eliminate costs for
those in need, while making sure there
are enough spaces for everyone.

We will clamp down on health
tourism, ensuring that those from
overseas who use NHS services pay
their fair share. And we will increase
the NHS surcharge paid by those
from overseas.

When we are negotiating trade
deals, the NHS will not be on the
table. The price the NHS pays for
drugs will not be on the table. The
services the NHS provides will not be
on the table.

1

Improving social care

It is a basic, compassionate
Conservative belief that we should
care for those in need — helping
those who cannot help themselves.

Thanks to decades of economic growth
and scientific innovation, people are
living longer, healthier lives. But this,
alongside the rise of dementia and other
chronic conditions, means that the
pressures on the elderly care system

are ever-increasing. There has also been
significant growth in the number of
working-age people with disabilities who
need care at a younger age.

We need to have a system to give every
person the dignity and security that
they deserve. This is a significant and
complex challenge and in order to lay
the foundations, we must plan for the
infrastructure, workforce growth and
healthcare integration that is required
fora care system fit for the 21st century.

Because this is a long-term problem that
will affect so many people, any solution
has to be able to survive long-term.
We must build the same level of
consensus on social care as we have
already built on the NHS.

So we will build a cross-party

consensus to bring forward an answer
that solves the problem, commands

12

the widest possible support, and stands
the test of time. That consensus will
consider a range of options but one
condition we do make is that nobody
needing care should be forced to sell
their home to pay for it.

As a first step, and to stabilise the
system, we announced in the autumn
additional funding of £1 billion for the
year beginning in April 2020. We are
now confirming this additional funding
in every year of the new Parliament.

We will also extend the entitlement to
leave for unpaid carers, the majority of
whom are women, to one week.

We also want to save millions of people,
and their families, from suffering

the agony of a slow decline due to
dementia. We will make finding a cure
one of our Government's biggest
collective priorities — one of the ‘grand
challenges’ that will define our future
along with the impact of climate
change or artificial intelligence. This will
include doubling research funding into
dementia and speeding up trials for
new treatments.

We will also provide £74 million over
three years for additional capacity in
community care settings for those
with learning disabilities and autism.

We need a long-
term solution

for social care —
that’s why we are
committing to an
ambitious three-
point plan:

1) £1 billion extra of funding every
year for more social care staff and
better infrastructure, technology
and facilities.

We will commit to urgently seek
a cross-party consensus in order
to bring forward the necessary
proposal and legislation for long-
term reform.

The prerequisite of any solution
will be a guarantee that no one
needing care has to sell their
home to pay for it.

 

Invest in our schools

Talent is evenly spread in this country,
but opportunity is not. As Conservatives,
we believe absolutely in equality of
opportunity — the idea that every child,
in every part of the country, should have
a fair chance. It is not only the most
important thing we can do to unleash
the UK’s potential, but is at the heart of
creating a fair and just society.

This is why we want to ensure every child
has access to a great state school — that
every pupil gets the qualifications they
need for a prosperous future, while
learning in an environment where they
will be happy and fulfilled.

In his first months in office, Boris Johnson
announced an extra £14 billion in funding
for schools. That translates to £150 million
a week, and will include at least £5,000 a
year for each secondary school pupil and
at least £4,000 for each primary school
pupil. This also includes £780 million in new
funding to support children with Special
Educational Needs next year alone.

One of the Conservative Party's proudest
achievements is that we have raised
standards in our schools and improved
behaviour. Students learn best when they
are stretched, challenged and nurtured — in
an environment where there is no disruption
and no excuses for bad behaviour.

In the last nine years, the percentage of
children passing their primary reading
check has gone up from 58 per cent

to 82 per cent. We have strengthened
teachers’ powers to deal with bullying
and disruption. We have given schools
the ability to decide how money is best
spent — because we trust parents and
headteachers to know what is best for
the children in their care.

For our children to get the training and
opportunities they deserve, they need

to have the best teachers. We want to
attract the best talent into teaching and
recognise the great work they do, so we're
raising teachers’ starting salaries to
£30,000 — among the most competitive
in the graduate labour market.

We also want to build on our record of
raising standards, improving behaviour
and promoting knowledge and creativity.

> Wewill back heads and teachers
on discipline. We will expand our
programme to help schools with the
worst behaviour learn from the best
— and back heads to use exclusions.
Unlike Labour, we believe that Ofsted
inspection serves a valuable purpose
not just in improving standards but in
improving behaviour. We will continue
to help teachers tackle bullying,
including homophobic bullying. No
child should be bullied on account of
who their parents are or where they
come from.

»

We will create more great schools.

We will continue to do everything we

can to ensure every school is a great
school. We will continue to support
innovation, like our successful maths
schools, set up for the most gifted young
physicists and mathematicians. We will
expand ‘alternative provision’ schools
for those who have been excluded. We
will also deliver more school places

for children with complex Special
Educational Needs. We will intervene

in schools where there is entrenched
underperformance. We will continue

to ensure that parents can choose the
schools that best suit their children and
best prepare them for the future. And we
will continue to build more free schools.

We will invest in arts, music and sport.
Over the last nine years we have made
real improvements in maths, English
and science, and given more children
access to a rich academic curriculum.
We retain our commitment to the

core subjects and also want young
people to learn creative skills and
widen their horizons, so we will offer an
‘arts premium to secondary schools
to fund enriching activities for all
pupils. And to ensure children are
getting an active start to life, we will
invest in primary school PE teaching
and ensure that it is being properly
delivered. We want to do more to help
schools make good use of their sports
facilities and to promote physical
literacy and competitive sport.

13

Vulnerable
children

Children who end up in care are
more likely to struggle as adults,
denied the love and stability most of
us take for granted. We will prioritise
stable, loving placements for those
children — adoption where possible
or foster parents recruited by the
local authority. We will review the
care system to make sure that all
care placements and settings are
providing children and young adults
with the support they need.

Support working
families

Since 2010, the Conservatives have
helped more than 1,000 people on
average into work every day.

That is an extraordinary figure. And it has
only been possible because of the strong
economy we have helped to create; our
support for business; and our welfare
reforms, which have encouraged more
people into work. The majority of jobs
created since 2010 have been high-
quality: full-time and outside London
and the South East.

Whoever you are, we want to make

it easier for you to get a good and
rewarding job — and to be able to
combine a rewarding career with raising
a family or caring for elderly or disabled
relatives, rather than being forced to
prioritise between them. We want to
make sure that you get to keep more of
the money you earn, and that we keep
your bills low. And we want to make
sure that those who can’t work, or have
entered retirement, get the level of
support they need.

We have focused, over the past decade,
on making sure that work always pays

— particularly for those most in need of
support. We have raised the minimum
wage significantly and introduced and
consistently raised the National Living
Wage. We have doubled the personal

allowance to £12,500, so that everyone
gets to earn a decent amount before they
are taxed. And we have made sure the
state pension keeps pace with earnings.

In our first months, we announced an
increase in the National Living Wage

to two thirds of average earnings,
currently forecast at £10.50 an hour,
and widened its reach to everyone over
21. That means an average pay rise of
£4,000 per year for four million people
by 2024.

To help young people get a foot on
the employment ladder, we abolished
employers’ National Insurance
Contributions for under-21s and
apprentices under 25.

Creating millions more jobs is one of the
Conservatives’ proudest achievements.
ALabour Government that makes it
harder for businesses to grow and to hire —
that allows people to sink into dependency
rather than encouraging them to work and
earn — could undo all of this progress.

Amajority Conservative Government

will deliver a major package of measures
designed to ensure that it always pays to
work, while doing everything we can to
protect and support those who cannot —
and to address the cost of living pressures
that we all face.

> We promise not to raise the rates of
income tax, National Insurance or
VAT. This is a tax guarantee that will
protect the incomes of hard-working
families across the next Parliament.

> We not only want to freeze taxes,
but to cut them too. We will raise
the National Insurance threshold
to £9,500 next year — representing
a tax cut for 31 million workers.
Our ultimate ambition is to ensure
that the first £12,500 you earn is
completely free of tax — which would
put almost £500 per year in people's
pockets.

> Raising a family should be the most
fulfilling experience of your life. But

childcare are a heavy burden. We want
to give parents the freedom, support
and choice to look after their children
in the way that works best for them.
We will establish a new £1 billion fund
to help create more high quality,
affordable childcare, including before
and after school and during the
school holidays.

> For many families, energy costs are
a major source of financial pressure.
We will keep our existing energy
cap and introduce new measures
to lower bills. We will also give the
Competition and Markets Authority
enhanced powers to tackle consumer
rip-offs and bad business practices.
We recognise that water bills can be

 

a major source of financial pressure,
so will extend the water rebate for
those in the South West.

On entering Government in 2010,

the Conservatives acted decisively

to protect the UK’s pensioners. The
‘triple lock’ we introduced has meant
that those who have worked hard and
put in for decades can be confident
that the state will be there to support
them when they need it. We will

keep the triple lock, the winter fuel
payment, the older person's bus
pass and other pensioner benefits,
ensuring that older people have the
security and dignity they deserve.

We recognise the value of free TV
licences for over-75s and believe
they should be funded by the BBC.

A number of workers,
disproportionately women, who
earn between £10,000 and £12,500
have been missing out on pension
benefits because of a loophole
affecting people with net pay
pension schemes. We will conduct
a comprehensive review to look at
how to fix this issue.

We will use our freedom from the EU
to improve the UK’s tax regime — not
least by abolishing the tampon tax.

> To help those looking after family increase SEND funding and support

 

> Weas Conservatives believe that

everyone who can work, should
work — and that it should always
pay them to do so. But we also
believe that those who truly can’t
work must be given the help they
need. That is why we will continue
the roll-out of Universal Credit,
which combines multiple benefits
into one while building a clearer
pathway from welfare into work. We
have already acted to increase work
allowances, a move worth £630

to working families with children,
and those with disabilities, and

we will do more to make sure that
Universal Credit works for the most
vulnerable. We will also end the
benefit freeze, while making sure it
pays to work more hours.

>» Atthe same time, we will make

sure those who cheat the system
by committing benefit fraud are
punished. There is no excuse for
exploiting others who have worked
hard and paid in.

members, especially women, we
will support the main carer in any
household receiving the Universal
Credit payment. And we will continue
our efforts through the tax and
benefits system to reduce poverty,
including child poverty. Children
should grow up in an environment
with no limits to their potential —
which is one of the reasons we are
making it a priority to put more
money in the pockets of low-paid
workers and maintaining our
commitment to free school meals.

We will also extend the entitlement
to leave for unpaid carers, the
majority of whom are women, to
one week.

As part of our efforts to empower
and support disabled people,we
will reduce the number of
reassessments a disabled person
must go through when a significant
change in condition is unlikely —
because you should not have to
provide repeated proof of your
disability in order to receive support.
We will publish a National Strategy
for Disabled People before the

end of 2020. This will look at ways

to improve the benefits system,
opportunities and access for
disabled people in terms of housing,
education, transport and jobs. It will
include our existing commitments to

pupils, students and adults to get
careers advice, internships, and
transition into work. We will reduce
the disability employment gap.

Make our
country safer

Our first duty as a Government is to
keep our country safe. One of Boris
Johnson’s first actions as Prime
Minister was to start recruiting
20,000 new police officers. These
new officers will take violent
criminals off the streets and protect
us and our country.

The Conservatives will always back the
brave men and women of our police
and security services, which is why

we will empower the police, backing
the increased use of stop and search
as long as it is fair and proportionate.
And we will provide them with the
equipment they need.

We need a fair justice system — one that
stands for the law-abiding majority, not
the criminal minority, and that gives a
second chance to those who have served
their time and wish to make a fresh start.

In order to successfully keep our streets safe, we need to turn people away from
crime and end the cycle of reoffending:

Youth offending

Addiction

why we will back teachers

serious crime.

 

Drug addiction fuels

crime, violence and family
breakdown — and new
dangerous substances are
driving an increase in deaths
from drug abuse. We will
tackle drug-related crime, and
CletalBt-le a MWg Ree MC
approach to treatment so we
can reduce drug deaths and
break the cycle of crime linked
to addiction.

 

We will create a prisoner
education service focused

on work-based training

and skills. We will improve
employment opportunities
for ex-offenders, including a
job coach in each prison. This
approach is proven to reduce
reoffending. We are improving
prison security to protect
staff, stop drug smuggling and
reduce violence.

We will back our police by equipping
officers with the powers and tools
they need to keep themselves and

all of us safe, including tasers and
body cameras. We will put the Police
Covenant into law to ensure they
have the support they need.

Police will be empowered by a new
court order to target known knife
carriers, making it easier for officers
to stop and search those convicted
of knife crime. Anyone charged with
knife possession will appear before
magistrates within days not weeks.
Those who use a knife as a weapon
should go to prison.

We will introduce tougher
sentencing for the worst offenders
and end automatic halfway release
from prison for serious crimes. For
child murderers, there will be life
imprisonment without parole.

We will use our new freedoms after
Brexit to prevent more foreign
national offenders entering our
country. We will cut the number

of foreign nationals in our prisons,
and increase penalties to stop them
returning.

We will back all those who put their
lives on the line to keep us safe
— police and prison officers and

 

emergency service workers. We will
pass the Police Protection Bill and
consult on doubling the maximum
sentence for assaulting workers in
emergency services such as police
officers, firefighters and paramedics.

We will strengthen the
accountability of elected Police and
Crime Commissioners and expand
their role. People must have an
accountable local leader delivering on
their crime and justice priorities, who
they can vote out.

We will expand electronic tagging
for criminals serving time outside
jail, including the use of sobriety
tags for those whose offending is
fuelled by alcohol.

We will toughen community
sentences, for example by tightening
curfews and making those convicted
do more hours of community payback
to clean up our parks and streets.

We will embrace new technologies
and crack down on online crimes.

We will create a new national cyber
crime force and empower the police
to safely use new technologies like
biometrics and artificial intelligence,
along with the use of DNA, within a
strict legal framework. We will also
create a world-class National Crime
Laboratory.

»

We will counter the growing threat
of serious and organised crime. We
will strengthen the National Crime
Agency so it can tackle the threats
we face, from fraud, county lines
gangs and child sexual abuse to illicit
finance, modern slavery and people-
trafficking.

We will add 10,000 more prison

places, with £2.75 billion already
committed to refurbishing and

creating modern prisons.

We will maintain the ban on
prisoners voting from jail.

We will conduct a root-and-branch
review of the parole system to
improve accountability and public
safety, giving victims the right to
attend hearings for the first time, and
we will establish a Royal Commission
on the criminal justice process.

We will combat extremism and do
all we can to ensure that extremists
never receive public money.

We will keep our country safe from
terrorism. We will invest in the
police and security services and
give them the powers they need to
combat new threats. In the wake of
the terrible events in Manchester in
2017, we will improve the safety and
security of public venues.

> Wewill tackle unauthorised
traveller camps. We will give the
police new powers to arrest and
seize the property and vehicles of
trespassers who set up unauthorised
encampments, in order to protect our
communities. We will make intentional
trespass a criminal offence, and we
will also give councils greater powers
within the planning system.

Supporting all victims
of crime

Delivering justice does not just mean
treating defendants fairly, but doing
right by victims. So we will pass

and implement a Victims’ Law that
guarantees victims’ rights and the
level of support they can expect.

> Wewill support all victims of
domestic abuse and pass the
Domestic Abuse Bill. We will increase
support for refuges and community
support for victims of rape and
sexual abuse. We will pilot integrated
domestic abuse courts that address
criminal and family matters in parallel.

> Wewill continue to fight crime
against women and girls, including
rape, Female Genital Mutilation and
forced marriage. Our support for the
main carer receiving Universal Credit
will help give greater independence
to individuals, most often women,
trapped with coercive partners.

19

> Wewill protect people from
physical attack or harassment
whether for their sex, sexual
orientation, ethnicity, religion or
disability, and expand funding for

will vigorously combat harassment
and violence against all religious
groups, and against LGBT people.
We will ensure that those who
work in countering extremism
are protected from threats and
intimidation. We will ban public
bodies from imposing their
own direct or indirect boycotts,
disinvestment or sanctions campaigns
against foreign countries. These
undermine community cohesion.

> Wewilllegislate to make the UK
the safest place in the world to be
online — protecting children from
online abuse and harms, protecting
the most vulnerable from accessing
harmful content, and ensuring there
is no safe space for terrorists to
hide online — but at the same time
defending freedom of expression and
in particular recognising and defending
the invaluable role of a free press. Also,
given how the online worldis moving,
the Gambling Act is increasingly
becoming an analogue law ina digital
age. We will review it, with a particular
focus on tackling issues around loot
boxes and credit card misuse.

Fix our immigration
system

The vote to leave the EU was, among
other things, a vote to take back
control of our borders.

That is why a majority Conservative
Government will get Brexit done,
and then introduce a firmer and
fairer Australian-style points-based
immigration system, so that we can
decide who comes to this country on
the basis of the skills they have and
the contribution they can make — not
where they come from. Migrants will
contribute to the NHS — and pay in
before they can receive benefits.

Our new system gives us real control
over who is coming in and out. It
allows us to attract the best and
brightest from all over the world.

Only by establishing immigration
controls and ending freedom of
movement will we be able to attract

the high-skilled workers we need

to contribute to our economy, our
communities and our public services.
There will be fewer lower-skilled
migrants and overall numbers will come
down. And we will ensure that the British
people are always in control.

Attracting the best and
brightest

We want the UK to be a magnet for
the best and brightest, with special
immigration routes for those who
will make the biggest contribution.
We will create bespoke visa schemes
for new migrants who will fill
shortages in our public services,
build the companies and innovations
of the future and benefit Britain for
years to come. These include:

> The NHS Visa. Qualified doctors,
nurses and allied health
professionals with a job offer from
the NHS, who have been trained
to a recognised standard, and who
have good working English, will be
offered fast-track entry, reduced
visa fees and dedicated support to
come to the UK with their families.

> Actively recruiting leaders in their
field to come to the UK. The small
number of the best technology and
science graduates from the top
universities in the world and those
who win top scientific prizes will be
offered fast-track entry to the UK —
these people can do more than any
others to drive scientific progress
and help our NHS and our economy.

Our student visa will help universities
attract talented young people and
allow those students to stay on to apply
for work here after they graduate.

Our start-up visa, alongside our
new rules for those of exceptional
talent, will ensure that we can
attract the entrepreneurs of the
future who want to start great
businesses here in the UK.

We want our party, and our
Government, to represent modern
Britain — a diverse and tolerant
country with confidence in its own
identity and values. We believe the
enduring beliefs that unite us are far
more important than our differences.

Our society has been enriched by
immigration and we will always
recognise the contribution of those who
have helped build our public services,
businesses, culture and communities.

We will ensure no matter where in the
world you or your family come from,
your rights will be respected and you will
be treated with fairness and dignity.

  
 
 

We will tackle prejudice, racism

and discrimination and address the
complex reasons why some groups do
less well at school, earn less at work,
or are more likely to be victims of

crime. We will act to improve the lives
of all and reject the politics of division.
Our priority is to focus on practical
solutions that make a real difference
to people's lives.

> Wewill boost English language
teaching to empower existing
migrants and help promote
integration into society.

> Wewill back the National Citizen
Service and promote it in schools
as a way of bringing communities
together. The Youth Futures
Foundation will invest at least
£90 million to improve employment
outcomes for young people.

> Wewill improve the quality
of evidence and data within
Government about the types of
barriers different groups face,
ensuring that fairness is at the
heart of everything we do.

> Wewill continue to grant asylum
and support to refugees fleeing
persecution, with the ultimate aim
of helping them to return home if it
is safe to do so.

> We will champion freedom of
expression and tolerance, both in
the UK and overseas.

> Wewill ensure that the historic
contribution of migrant groups is
recognised. We will maintain our
support for a memorial recognising
the contribution of the Windrush
Generation in a prominent site in
London.

Contributing to our
country

It is a basic point of principle — and
natural justice — that you should not
be able to take out before you have put
in. Of course we should help those in
genuine need — especially those who
have fled from persecution. But at the
same time, it is both right and fair that,
as in other countries, people making
the UK their home should pay into the
tax system for a reasonable period of
time before they can access welfare.

Our new immigration system will mean:

> People coming into the country from
the EU will only be able to access
unemployment, housing, and child
benefit after five years, in the way
non-EEA migrants currently do.

> Weill no longer allow people to
claim child benefit for children
living overseas.

> Wewill require new arrivals to
contribute to the funding of the
NHS and will increase the health
surcharge to ensure it covers the
full cost of use. We will also enforce

charges on those who come to our
country and use our health services
without contributing, doubling the
budget for our health tourism
enforcement unit. We will continue
to offer free emergency care to
anyone who needs it.

> Inorder to help communities cope
better with pressures on public
services, we will ensure that new GP
and school places are delivered ahead
of people moving into new housing
developments, and will invest in
technical skills and work incentives so
British workers take up as many jobs as
possible.

This is a package of measures that is
fair, firm and compassionate — that
brings the immigration system, after
so many years, into line with the British
people's own sense of what is right. But
we cannot do any of it unless we have a
strong Conservative Government that
can get Brexit done.

23

 

We Will Unleash
Britain's Potential

Getting Brexit done allows us to focus on making this the best possible place to live and work
— to use our post-Brexit freedoms to build prosperity and strengthen and level up every part

of the country.

Because it is not just Britain’s potential that we want to unleash, but that of the British

people.

Our plan means making sure people
have access to world-class public
services, that they feel safe on the
streets, that working families get to
keep more of their own money, and that
we help with cost of living pressures.

But it also means making sure that we
share prosperity across the country,
addressing the longstanding economic
challenges in parts of the country. We
will invest responsibly and prudently
in the infrastructure that can make a
difference, and ensure communities
in every corner of the United Kingdom
are pleasant, safe and prosperous.
And we will invest far more in helping
workers train and retrain for the jobs and
industries of the future.

Investing in people, restoring the fabric of
our towns and cities, building the homes
we need, supporting science and industry,
strengthening the great Union between the
United Kingdom's four nations — that is how
we will unleash our country’s full potential.

We are the only party that can deliver
this programme, because we are the only
party that understands the symmetry

at the heart of the UK economy. That

the only way to fund world-class public
services and outstanding infrastructure
is to encourage the millions of British
businesses that create the wealth of the
nation — especially small businesses,
family firms and the self-employed.

We stand for the people working every
hour they can, those taking a risk on

a new idea, those challenging existing
markets. Their success is our success.

And we stand for those who give their time
to help others — the charities, community
groups and volunteers who already do so
much to make our country a better place.

We believe, in other words, that Britain is a

great country — the greatest place on earth.
Together, we can make it greater still.

25

Revive our towns
and cities

People across the UK are rightly
proud of where they come from, and
of their local areas. But too many
communities feel let down. Violent
crime and anti-social behaviour are
ignored amid a backdrop of boarded-
up department stores, shops and
pubs. Great towns and cities are
being held back.

We as Conservatives want to give you
freedom — low taxes, opportunity, the
chance to realise your dreams. But we
also want to give you security — safe and
pleasant streets, and the ability to take
pride and comfort from the community
around you.

This is why, in his first months as Prime
Minister, Boris Johnson has set out

an agenda for levelling up every part
of the UK — not just investing in our
great towns and cities, as well as rural
and coastal areas, but giving them far
more control of how that investment is
made. In the 21st century, we need to
get away from the idea that ‘Whitehall
knows best’ and that all growth must
inevitably start in London. Because we
as Conservatives believe you can and
must trust people and communities to
make the decisions that are right for
them.

26

To underpin this national renewal, we
will invest £100 billion in additional
infrastructure spending — on roads,
rail and other responsible, productive
investment which will repair and
refurbish the fabric of our country and
generate greater growth in the long
run. For example, flood defences will
receive £4 billion in new funding.

We will ensure that we are always
spending what we can afford —
with strict limits on borrowing and
repayment costs.

We will use this historic investment to
level up and connect this country, so
that everyone can get a fair share of its
future prosperity.

A transport revolution

Akey part of our plan to level up the
UK’s cities and regions is to connect
them. Leeds is the largest city in
Western Europe without a light rail or
metro system. And European cities
are often more productive than our
own in large part because they have
better infrastructure.

We will connect our cities:

> Wewill build Northern Powerhouse
Rail between Leeds and Manchester
and then focus on Liverpool, Tees
Valley, Hull, Sheffield and Newcastle.

We will invest in the Midlands

Rail Hub, strengthening rail links
including those between Birmingham,
Leicester, Nottingham, Coventry,
Derby, Hereford and Worcester.

We will also invest in improving
train lines to the South West and
East Anglia.

We will extend contactless pay-as-
you go ticketing to almost 200 more
stations in the South East, meaning
that 50 per cent of all rail journeys
and almost all London commuter
journeys can be completed using a
contactless bank card.

We will give city regions the funding
to upgrade their bus, tram and train
services to make them as good

as London’s, with more frequent,
better-integrated services, more
electrification, modern buses and
trains and smart ticketing — such as
the vision proposed by Andy Street
for the West Midlands.

The railways need accountability, not
nationalisation. So we will end the
complicated franchising model and
create a simpler, more effective rail
system, including giving metro mayors
control over services in their areas.

We will make a £28.8 billion
investment in strategic and local

roads. We will invest £1 billion in
completing a fast-charging network
to ensure that everyone is within 30
miles of a rapid electric vehicle charging
station. We will consult on the earliest
date we can phase out the sale of
new conventional petrol and diesel
cars, while minimising the impact on
drivers and businesses.

We will require that a minimum
service operates during transport
strikes. Rail workers deserve a
fair deal, but it is not fair to let
the trade unions undermine the
livelihoods of others.

HS2 is a great ambition, but

will now cost at least £81 billion
and will not reach Leeds or
Manchester until as late as 2040.
We will consider the findings of
the Oakervee review into costs
and timings and work with leaders
of the Midlands and the North to
decide the optimal outcome.

Connectivity is not just about
the UK’s great cities. To help
communities across the country,
we will restore many of the
Beeching lines, reconnecting
smaller towns such as Fleetwood
and Willenhall that have suffered
permanent disadvantage since
they were removed from the rail
network in the 1960s.

 

> Wewill invest in superbus networks
with lower fares — flat fares in
urban areas — and increased
frequency. We will keep bus fares
low, bring back and protect rural
routes, and speed up your journeys.
We will invest in electric buses,
developing the UK’s first all-
electric-bus town.

> Wewill launch the biggest ever
pothole-filling programme as part
of our National Infrastructure
Strategy — and our major
investment in roads will ensure
new potholes are much less likely
to appear in the future.

> We will support commuter cycling
routes, so that more people can
cycle safely to work and more
families can go out together. We
will create a new £350 million
Cycling Infrastructure Fund with

28

mandatory design standards

for new routes. We will extend
Bikeability — cycling proficiency
training — to every child. And we
will work with the NHS to promote
cycling for healthier living.

Parliament has voted in principle

to support a third runway at
Heathrow, but it is a private sector
project. It is for Heathrow to
demonstrate that it can meet its air
quality and noise obligations, that
the project can be financed and
built and that the business case is
realistic. The scheme will receive no
new public money. More broadly,
we will use new air traffic control
technology to cut the time aircraft
spend waiting to land, reducing

delays, noise nuisance and pollution.

We will also build on Britain’s
pioneering work in electric and
low-carbon flight.

Connecting the UK is not just about
transport. We are Europe's technology
capital, producing start-ups and success
stories at a dazzling pace. But not
everyone can share the benefits. We
intend to bring full fibre and gigabit-
capable broadband to every home and
business across the UK by 2025.

We know how difficult it will be, so we
have announced a raft of legislative
changes to accelerate progress and
£5 billion of new public funding to
connect premises which are not
commercially viable.

Supporting local
communities

Local government is the bedrock of
our democracy. We are proud that
Conservative councils have led the
way in helping keep council taxes
low, providing value for money and
supporting local communities.

We will ensure that councils continue to
deliver essential local services — which is
why they received a substantial funding
increase in the most recent Spending
Round. Local people will continue to
have the final say on council tax, being
able to veto excessive rises. This does
not prevent councils raising more — but
it does ensure that they will need to have
solid and convincing reasons for doing so.

We remain committed to devolving
power to people and places across the
UK. Our ambition is for full devolution
across England, building on the
successful devolution of powers to
city region mayors, Police and Crime
Commissioners and others, so that
every part of our country has the
power to shape its own destiny. We will
publish an English Devolution White
Paper setting out our plans next year.

Through our City and Growth Deals we
have already delivered more than

£9 billion of funding across England,
and almost £3 billion to Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland.

Through bodies like the Northern
Powerhouse, Western Gateway and
Midlands Engine we will drive greater
levels of foreign investment into the

UK, promoting our towns, cities and
counties around the world. As part of our
plans for full devolution we will also invite
proposals from local areas for similar
growth bodies across the rest of England,
such as the Oxford-Cambridge Arc.

This is an agenda which shows that
the days of Whitehall knows best are
over. We will give towns, cities and
communities of all sizes across the UK
real power and real investment to drive
the growth of the future and unleash
their full potential.

 

face in getting on the housing ladder
is the deposit. There are more than
three million people, many of them
with good jobs and secure prospects,
who would have been homeowners
before the economic crisis in 2008
but have been locked out of the
mortgage market. We will encourage
anew market in long-term fixed rate
mortgages which slash the cost of
deposits, opening up a secure path to
home ownership for first-time buyers
in all parts of the United Kingdom.

We will offer more homes to local
families, enabling councils to use
developers’ contributions via the
planning process to discount homes
in perpetuity by a third for local people
who cannot otherwise afford to buy in
their area. Councils could use this to
prioritise key workers in their area, like
police, nurses and teachers.

We will maintain our commitment to

a Right to Buy for all council tenants.
We will also maintain the voluntary
Right to Buy scheme agreed with
housing associations. Following the
successful voluntary pilot scheme in
the Midlands, we will evaluate new pilot
areas in order to spread the dream of

Home ownership is one of the most
fundamental Conservative values.
People are happier, more secure and
more rooted in their communities
when they own their own home —
and know that they can pass it on to
future generations.

For the UK to unleash its potential,
young people need the security of
knowing that home ownership is
within their reach — that they too can
have a tangible stake in society, can
be rooted in their communities and
have a place to raise a family.

A majority Conservative Government
will continue to increase the number

30

of homes being built. But we must
also rebalance the housing market
towards more home ownership —
while ensuring fairness for the new
generation of renters.

While we want to encourage as

many people as possible into home
ownership, we recognise that not
everyone can afford their own home
— and that those in social housing
deserve the same dignity, respect and
fair treatment as private renters.

As Boris Johnson has promised, we

will bring forward a Social Housing
White Paper which will set out further
measures to empower tenants and
support the continued supply of social
homes. This will include measures to
provide greater redress, better regulation

and improve the quality of social housing.

 

We will also commit to renewing

the Affordable Homes Programme,
in order to support the delivery of
hundreds of thousands of affordable
homes. This is a key part of our
efforts to prevent people from falling
into homelessness, along with

fully enforcing the Homelessness
Reduction Act. We will also end the
blight of rough sleeping by the end

of the next Parliament by expanding
successful pilots and programmes
such as the Rough Sleeping Initiative
and Housing First, and working to
bring together local services to meet
the health and housing needs of
people sleeping on the streets.

We will help pay for this by bringing
in a stamp duty surcharge on non-UK
resident buyers.

Places we want to live in

Since 2010 there has been a considerable
increase in homebuilding. We have

Butit still isn’t enough. That is why we will
continue our progress towards our target of
300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s.
This will see us build at least a million
more homes, of all tenures, over the next
Parliament — in the areas that really need

builders, and support modern methods of
construction.

Crucially, however, we need to make sure
homes are built ina way that makes sense
for the people already living in the area and
for the families moving in:

> Infrastructure first. We will
amend planning rules so that the
infrastructure — roads, schools, GP
surgeries — comes before people move
into new homes. And our new £10
billion Single Housing Infrastructure
Fund will help deliver it faster.

> Beautiful, high-quality homes. We
will ask every community to decide
onits own design standards for new
development, allowing residents a

greater say on the style and design of
development in their area, with local
councils encouraged to build more
beautiful architecture.

report or review can truly capture the
heartache, sorrow, anger and grief that
many people feel. We have already
committed to implementing and
legislating for all the recommendations
of the Hackitt Review and the first
phase of the independent inquiry. We
will continue to work with industry,
housing associations and individuals to
ensure every home is safe and secure.
And we will support high rise residential
residents with the removal of unsafe
cladding, and continue with our
rigorous process of materials testing.

Community housing and self-build.
We will support community housing
by helping people who want to build
their own homes find plots of land and
access the Help to Buy scheme. We
will also support communities living
on council estates who want to take

Make Britain the
best place to
start and growa
business

We want Britain to be the best
country in the world to start and
grow a business — a place where
entrepreneurs know they can build
on their ideas and find success.

Not only because businesses are good
for society — creating the jobs that
put bread on the table, and generating
the tax revenue that funds our vital
public services.

But because we believe that we
should do everything we can to
support those who want to start their
own company, strike out on their own,
and have an idea that grows into a
world-leading business. Our mission
as Conservatives is to give everyone
across the country the opportunity to
fulfil their potential.

We have many strengths. We area
highly competitive economy with a
strong education system and well-
respected regulatory framework. We
have more world-class universities
than anywhere in Europe.

 

We are a magnet for talent, and home
to more innovative and successful

32

new companies than anywhere on

the continent — especially in the
technology sector. In areas such as
tech, financial services, law and the
creative industries we lead the world —
and will continue to do so after Brexit.

Of the nearly six million businesses
in this country, the vast majority are
small and medium sized. Small and
family businesses are the backbone
of the economy and Britain is
immeasurably stronger for their
contribution.

Once we get Brexit done, we can use
our new freedoms to ensure that
Britain’s businesses can unleash their
enormous potential — that they can
invest, hire, export and grow, rather
than being crushed by Jeremy Corbyn
and John McDonnell’s inexorable
hostility towards aspiration and
entrepreneurship.

Driving down costs
and supporting small
businesses

We understand the challenge of
increasing running costs, especially for
smaller firms, and are committed to
reducing them.

Our plan to upgrade infrastructure will
make it easier for businesses to operate
— to move goods about the country and
to connect to customers around the

world via gigabit broadband. And our new
£3 billion National Skills Fund, alongside
other major investment in skills and
training and our reforms to high-skilled
immigration, will ensure that businesses
can find and hire the workers they need.

But we also want to tackle the other
everyday obstacles that they face.

> Wewill cut the burden of tax on
business by reducing business rates.
This will be done via a fundamental
review of the system. As a first
step, we will further reduce
business rates for retail businesses,
as well as extending the discount
to grassroots music venues, small
cinemas and pubs. That means
protecting your high street and
community from excessive tax
hikes and keeping town centres
vibrant.

>» Wewill increase the Employment
Allowance for small businesses — a
tax cut for half a million small firms.

> Wewill support start-ups and
small businesses via government
procurement, and commit to
paying them on time. We will also
clamp down on late payment
more broadly and strengthen
the powers of the Small Business
Commissioner to support small
businesses that are exploited by
their larger partners.

> Wewill expand start-up loans,
which have particularly high
take-up from women and BAME
entrepreneurs. The British Business
Bank has supported 90,000 smaller
businesses with over £7 billion
in investment or loans, and will
continue to grow.

> Wewill help SMEs to become
exporters, so that they can seize
the opportunities that will become
available once we get Brexit done.

>» Good regulation is essential
to successful businesses: we
will strive to achieve the right
regulatory balance between
supporting excellent business
practice and protecting workers,
consumers and the environment.
Through our Red Tape Challenge,
we will ensure that regulation is
sensible and proportionate, and
that we always consider the needs
of small businesses when devising
new rules, using our new freedom
after Brexit to ensure that British
rules work for British companies.

» As well as encouraging investment
in physical building and equipment,
we will help employers invest
in skills and look at how we can
improve the working of the
Apprenticeship Levy.

Backing entrepreneurs
and innovation

Every day, people risk their savings and

their future by becoming entrepreneurs.

They invent the new goods and
services that improve our lives. From
decarbonisation to expanding the
frontiers of artificial intelligence,

they are tackling some of the great
challenges of our time. We want to be
a nation of start-ups, and of successful
scale-ups. We have more ‘unicorns’

— new billion-dollar tech companies —
than any other nation in Europe.

We are proud of the work we have

done to support entrepreneurship
and want to see more entrepreneurs,

34

including women and those from BAME
backgrounds. Some of our work has been
spectacularly successful — such as the
Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme
and Enterprise Investment Scheme,
which we will continue in the next
Parliament. And by cutting corporation
tax from 28 per cent to 19 per cent, we
have encouraged more businesses to
invest and grow in the UK.

Some measures have worked, but
need to go further — as with R&D tax
credits. We will increase the tax credit
rate to 13 per cent and review the
definition of R&D so that important
investments in cloud computing and
data, which boost productivity and
innovation, are also incentivised.

 

We also have to recognise that some
measures haven't fully delivered on
their objectives. So we will review and
reform Entrepreneur's Relief.

Of course, supporting enterprise

is not just about championing
businesses — more people than ever
are moving into self-employment,
especially women. We will therefore
launch a review to explore how we
can better support the self-employed.
That includes improving their access
to finance and credit (not least
mortgages), making the tax system
easier to navigate, and examining how
better broadband can boost home-
working.

Building a fairer
taxation system

Conservatives believe in a corporate
tax system which rewards
entrepreneurship and punishes
evasion. We will always be whole-
heartedly on the side of business,
while making sure everyone pays
their fair share of tax. Already, the
top 1 per cent of income taxpayers
pay over 29 per cent of income tax
— higher than at any time under the
last Labour Government.

We will continue to build on this
to tackle tax evasion and reduce
opportunities for aggressive tax
avoidance.

Since 2010, we have introduced more
than 100 anti-avoidance measures
and secured more than £200 billion
which would otherwise have gone
unpaid — £24 billion in the last year
alone. We have led the international
fight against aggressive tax avoidance
and offshore tax havens, rewriting
global rules to ensure tax is paid
where profit is made. This has
included committing 100 jurisdictions
to ending bank secrecy.

But we can go further still. The

gap between the amount of tax
that should be paid and is actually
collected stands at £35 billion — still
too high. Hard-working families and

businesses who do pay their fair share
should know that we will not permit
evasion to go unchecked. So we will
set out a new anti-tax avoidance and
evasion law. This will:

> Double the maximum prison term
to 14 years for individuals convicted
of the most egregious examples of
tax fraud.

> Create a single, beefed-up Anti-
Tax Evasion unit in HMRC that
covers all duties and taxes, from
individual errors to deliberate non-
compliance — which is put ona
legislative footing.

> Consolidate existing anti-evasion
and avoidance measures and
powers.

> Introduce a new package of
anti-evasion measures, including
measures to end tax abuse in
the construction sector, crack
down on illicit tobacco packaging
and further measures to avoid
profit-shifting by multinational
companies to avoid paying taxes.

Major multinational companies should
pay their fair share of tax. As part of
our approach, we will implement the
Digital Services Tax.

While always backing entrepreneurs
that choose to make the UK the place

to invest and set up a business, we will
take further action to redesign the tax
system so that it boosts growth, wages
and investment and limits arbitrary tax
advantages for the wealthiest in society.

We are also strengthening the UK’s
corporate governance regime, and
will reform insolvency rules and the
audit regime so that customers and
suppliers — and UK taxpayers — are
better protected when firms like
Thomas Cook go into administration.
We will also carefully study the results
of the ongoing investigation into its
collapse. We will improve incentives
to attack the problem of excessive
executive pay and rewards for failure.

We will reintroduce legislation that
protects pension pots from being
plundered by reckless bosses, helps
savers be better informed with pension
dashboards, and creates a new style
of pension scheme which is more
sustainable for workers and employers.

35

Invest in Britain’s
people

The 2020s will see a transformation
in jobs. Automation and computing
will change how businesses function.
Our plan to deliver clean energy and
a carbon-neutral future means new
kinds of jobs in new industries. And
our departure from the European
Union means we can develop forward-
looking regulations to ensure we are
first in line to develop and benefit
from the technologies of the future.

This requires a dramatic rebooting

of our training system — to support
public services, existing businesses
and the businesses of the future.

But above all, we want to ensure

that Britain’s workers have the skills
they need to flourish — and that

every citizen of this country has the
opportunity to express their talents to
the fullest.

Levelling up Britain’s
skills

Since 2010, the Government has
invested significantly in technical
qualifications and apprenticeships,
with 3.8 million more apprenticeships.

In the next Parliament, we expect to

train up hundreds of thousands more
highly skilled apprentices. But we will go

36

further and require significant numbers
of new UK apprentices for all big new
infrastructure projects — new hospitals,
new schools, major transport projects
and so on, being built with pride by anew
generation of British workers.

Whatever age you are, nothing is more
Conservative than working hard to
improve your lot — and nothing is more
important for the Conservative Party
than supporting people in those efforts.

Our reforms and investment in
education and skills mean more
children are leaving school better
equipped for working life and there are
more high quality apprenticeships. But
there is much more to do to level up
the skills of the entire nation. Not just
to improve Britain’s productivity, but to
enable people to fulfil their potential.

As the centrepiece of our plan, we

will create a new National Skills

Fund worth £3 billion over the next
Parliament. This fund will provide
matching funding for individuals and
SMEs for high-quality education and
training. A proportion will be reserved
for further strategic investment in
skills, and we will consult widely on the
overall design.

The National Skills Fund will help to
transform the lives of people who
have not got onto the work ladder and
lack qualifications, as well as people

who are keen to return to work from,
Say, raising a family, or switch from
one career to another. It will not only
make this country more prosperous,
but fairer.

Just as universities have been
transformed by significant long-term
investment over the last few decades,
we need to make sure local colleges
are equally excellent places for people
to learn. We are therefore investing
almost £2 billion to upgrade the entire
further education college estate.

And we'll also have 20 Institutes

of Technology, which connect
high-quality teaching in science,
technology, engineering and maths to
business and industry.

 

Vitally, leaving the EU also means
that we can take back control of the
money that was being channelled via
its Structural Funds. We have already
announced a UK Shared Prosperity
Fund, to ensure that the people of the
UK do not lose out from the withdrawal
of EU funding (which was, of course,
only a small part of the billions of
pounds we were contributing), and to
replace the EU programme with one
that is fairer and better tailored to our
economy. And we will ensure that
£500 million of the UK Shared
Prosperity Fund is used to give
disadvantaged people the skills they
need to make a success of life.

Taken together, this package of
measures represents a profound

commitment to Britain’s future — to
helping people of whatever age and
background navigate the new world of
work, equip themselves with the skills
they need, increase their earnings and
Britain more productive.

As well as making Britain the best
place to start a business, and the
best place to learn and develop your
skills, we want to make the UK the
best place in the world to work.

the Conservative Government has
overseen since 2010 is proof that
there is no contradiction between high

Ullal heat] m eele-ialu(-] 5

In the next Parliament we will work to
maintain and strengthen our global
position in higher education. The Augar
Review made thoughtful recommendations
on tuition fee levels, the balance of funding
between universities, further education and
apprenticeships and adult learning, and we
will consider them carefully. We will look at
the interest rates on loan repayments with
a view to reducing the burden of debt on
students.

We also will continue to explore ways to
tackle the problem of grade inflation

and low quality courses, and improve

the application and offer system for
undergraduate students. Our approach will

be underpinned by a commitment to fairness,
quality of learning and teaching, and access.

Weill also strengthen academic freedom
and free speech in universities and
continue to focus on raising standards.

We will strengthen universities and
colleges’ civic role. We will invest in local
adult education and require the Office for
Students to look at universities’ success

in increasing access across all ages, not
just young people entering full-time
undergraduate degrees.

employment and high standards —
between dynamic growth and protecting
employees from unfair policies and
discriminatory treatment. Over the last
year, for example, unemployment has
continued to fall, even as average real
wages have increased.

We have raised the personal income
tax allowance, increased the minimum
wage and introduced and consistently
raised the National Living Wage to
ensure that people get to keep more
of what they earn and that work
always pays. And we have aimed to
strike the right balance between the
flexibility that the economy needs

and the security that employees

deserve, introducing new protections
for workers while preserving the
dynamism and job creation that drive
our shared prosperity.

Once we have got Brexit done, we will
go further. Because people cannot
fulfil their potential if they do not have
jobs that treat them with dignity and
respect, and if they are not in control
of their lives and their futures.

As Conservatives we will always
prioritise the principle of fairness in
the workplace, whether it is in the job
application process, ensuring equal
pay for equal work, or people’s working
conditions. We scrapped exclusivity
clauses in zero hours contracts to give
workers more flexibility.

 

We have already taken forward a
number of recommendations from
the Taylor Review and will build

on existing employment law with
measures that protect those in low-
paid work and the gig economy. For
example:

> Wewill create a single enforcement
body and crack down on any
employer abusing employment law,
whether by taking workers’ tips or
refusing them sick pay.

> Wewill ensure that workers
have the right to request a more
predictable contract and other
reasonable protections.

We also want to look at more radical ways
to support working families in the UK. Our
lifestyles have been transformed over
the last four decades — many families
today have two working parents who are
juggling work and other responsibilities.
They have to stretch themselves daily

to care for children, elderly relatives

and those with disabilities. For women,
who still tend to be the main carers in
households, this can have a big impact on
their careers and limit their participation
in the workplace.

But while the modern workplace is
adapting as a result, we can do more as
a Government to make things easier,
learning from sensible approaches
adopted in other countries. We will

therefore introduce a raft of measures
that balance the needs of employees
and employers:

> Wewill encourage flexible working
and consult on making it the default
unless employers have good reasons
not to.

>» We have reformed redundancy law
so companies cannot discriminate
against women immediately after
returning from maternity leave.

> Wewill legislate to allow parents to
take extended leave for neonatal
care, to support those new
mothers and fathers who need it
during the most vulnerable and
stressful days of their lives. And we
will look at ways to make it easier
for fathers to take paternity leave.

> We will extend the entitlement
to leave for unpaid carers, the
majority of whom are women,
to a week.

Over the last nine years, we have
extended the offer of free childcare
hours to more working parents. We
know that people value this support,
but wish it could be more flexible.
As outlined above, we will fund more
high-quality childcare before and
after school and during the holidays
so that working parents do not have

to choose between their careers and
their children.

Our vision for the labour market, in
other words, is not one where the state
does everything for you. It is one where
the state does everything it can to

help you help yourself — by upgrading
your skills, or by being able to balance
work and family life. It is one in which a
deep commitment to entrepreneurship
and business is matched by a desire to
ensure that the jobs that are created
are highly skilled, well-paid and fulfilling.

Unleash
innovation

The UK has a proud record of
innovation and discovery. We are the
country that gave the world penicillin,
the World Wide Web, the theories of
gravity and evolution, that unravelled
the structure of DNA. The University
of Cambridge alone has played host
to more Nobel laureates than have
been produced by any country in the
world bar the United States. More,
indeed, than France, Japanand China —
combined.

That spirit of discovery is still alive
in this country today. But we have
not always turned our genius for
innovation into jobs and companies
here in Britain. EU regulations have
been another barrier to innovation.

39

We need to use science and research
to unite and level up our country,
giving people opportunity and hope.

Once we have got Brexit done, we

will turn our attention to the great
challenges of the future such as clean
energy and advanced energy storage;
a cure for dementia; and solving
antibiotic resistance. To do this we will
make an unprecedented investment
in science so we can strengthen
research and build the foundations
for the new industries of tomorrow.

We are committing to the fastest

ever increase in domestic public R&D
spending, including in basic science
research to meet our target of 2.4 per
cent of GDP being spent on R&D across
the economy. Some of this new spending
will go to a new agency for high-risk,
high-payoff research, at arm's length
from government. We will continue to
support our outstanding science sector
as we leave the EU.

Unlike Corbyn’s Labour, we will not
spend blindly and wastefully.

> Wewill focus our efforts on areas
where the UK can generate a
commanding lead in the industries
of the future -— life sciences, clean
energy, space, design, computing,
robotics and artificial intelligence.

40

> In particular, we will make the UK the
leading global hub for life sciences
after Brexit.

> Wewill use our £1 billion Ayrton
Fund to develop affordable and
accessible clean energy that will
improve lives and help us to lead the
world in tackling climate change.

> Wewill use our increased R&D
funding from Government to attract
and kickstart private investment.

> Wewill support international
collaboration and exchange and
ensure UK teams can recruit the
skills and talent they need from
abroad.

> Wewill reform the science funding
system to cut the time wasted by
scientists filling in forms.

> Wewill unlock long-term capital
in pension funds to invest in and
commercialise our scientific
discoveries, creating a vibrant
science-based economy post-Brexit.

> Wewill continue to collaborate
internationally and with the EU
on scientific research, including
Horizon.

These unprecedented increases to
the science budget will be used to
drive forward the development of

technologies of critical importance
to the UK, by investing in clusters
around world-leading universities and
spreading knowledge.

But it isn’t just about laboratory work.
The UK is at its best when it allies

its extraordinary design and artistic
abilities with science and technology.
The Festival of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland in 2022 — a national
celebration which coincides with the
Birmingham Commonwealth Games
— will encourage our leading arts and
cultural organisations, universities,
research institutes and businesses
to come together to inspire the next
generation in British innovation and
creativity.

We will invest in world-class
computing and health data systems
that can aid research, such as the
ground-breaking genetic sequencing
carried out at the UK Biobank,
Genomics England and the new
Accelerating the Detection of Disease
project, which has the potential to
transform diagnosis and treatment.

We will use government procurement
to support new ideas and new
companies. We will continue to
support charities which have helped
to transform our public services.

Even as the UK forges ahead in the
future, we must not forget those
communities that have not shared
fully in the growth generated by our
economy.

This Government is committed to

improve infrequent or non-existent
services in the countryside, including
more on-demand services.

Just as in the wider economy we can
combine strong employment growth
with high employment standards, so
we believe that British farmers and
fishermen should be able to profit
by producing food and fish that are
the envy of the world — both for their
quality and the high standards to
which they were produced.

We want people, both at home and
abroad, to be lining up to buy British.
And one of the great opportunities of
Brexit is the chance to lead the world
in the quality of our food, agriculture
and land management — driven by
science-led, evidence-based policy.

And we want those same farmers and
fishermen to act as the stewards of
the natural world, preserving the UK’s
countryside and oceans as they have
for generations.

across the most beautiful areas of
the North a National Trail.

We will continue to lead the world
in tackling plastics pollution, both
in the UK and internationally, and
will introduce a new levy to increase
the proportion of recyclable plastics
in packaging. We will introduce
extended producer responsibility,
so that producers pay the full
costs of dealing with the waste
they produce, and boost domestic
recycling. We will ban the export

of plastic waste to non-OECD
countries, consulting with industry,
NGOs and local councils on the
date by which this should be
achieved.

We will crack down on the waste
and carelessness that destroys
our natural environment and
kills marine life. We will increase
penalties for fly-tipping, make
those on community sentences
clean up their parks and streets,
and introduce a deposit return
scheme to incentivise people to
recycle plastic and glass.

We will make no changes to the
Hunting Act.

Strengthen
our Union

The United Kingdom is the most
successful political and economic union
in history. Together, England, Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland are safer,
stronger and more prosperous. For
more than 300 years, our people have
built this great country together. And
we believe our best days lie ahead.

By getting Brexit done, we will deliver
certainty so that all four nations

of the UK can move on together.

This will allow us to strengthen the
Union, by making it our mission as a
Government to work for the whole of
the United Kingdom, delivering for all
of its people wherever they live.

Investing across
the Union

UK Shared Prosperity Fund: The UK
Shared Prosperity Fund will be used to
bind together the whole of the United
Kingdom, tackling inequality and
deprivation in each of our four nations.
It will replace the overly bureaucratic
EU Structural Funds — and not only
be better targeted at the UK’s specific
needs, but at a minimum match the
size of those funds in each nation.

Strengthening the Union: Conservatives
have a proud history of upholding

44

and strengthening the devolution
settlements in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. We also want to
ensure that the UK Government and

its institutions are working effectively
to realise the benefits of four nations
working together as one United
Kingdom. We will carefully consider

the recommendations of Lord

Dunlop's Independent Review into UK
Government Union capability when it is
published as we work to strengthen our
Union going forward.

Freeports: We will aim to ensure

that our new freeports benefit the
people in each of the four nations. We
believe that there are many places
across the United Kingdom that have
the opportunity to be successful
innovative hubs for global trade.

Standing up for
Northern Ireland

Northern Ireland enjoys huge benefits
from membership of the United
Kingdom and our country is stronger
and richer for Northern Ireland being
part of it. That is why we will never be
neutral on the Union and why we stand
for a proud, confident, inclusive and
modern unionism that affords equal
respect to all traditions and parts of
the community.

Our commitment to the 1998
Belfast Agreement and its successor

agreements is unshakeable and we

will not deviate from the principle

of consent or the three-stranded
approach. We will continue to work with
all sides to re-establish the Northern
Ireland Executive and Assembly so
that the people of Northern Ireland can
enjoy the full advantages of devolved
government for the benefit of the
whole community.

> Guaranteeing the full economic
benefits of Brexit: Northern
Ireland will enjoy the full economic
benefits of Brexit including new
free trade agreements with the rest
of the world. We will ensure that
Northern Ireland’s businesses and
producers enjoy unfettered access
to the rest of the UK and that in the
implementation of our Brexit deal,
we maintain and strengthen the
integrity and smooth operation of
our internal market.

> Turbocharging the Northern
Ireland economy: After Brexit, we
will support the Northern Ireland
Executive to improve infrastructure,
enterprise and tourism, reduce
public sector dependence and make
the most of our new City Deals. We
intend to devolve responsibility for
corporation tax and will consider the
same for short-haul Air Passenger
Duty to serve our goal of making
our Union more prosperous and
connected than ever before.

> Security and legacy issues: Keeping
people safe and secure will always be
our priority. That means taking action
to tackle the threat from terrorism
and the scourge of paramilitarism.
We will also never forget the immense
contribution of the police and Armed
Forces in standing firm against
terrorists in the past and the debt we
owe them for peace today. We will
continue to seek better ways of dealing
with legacy issues that provide better
outcomes for victims and survivors
and do more to give veterans the
protections they deserve.

Twelve years of SNP government
have led to an obsessive focus on
independence - all while Scotland’s
public services and its economy have
been neglected. So long as the SNP
are in power, Scottish schools and
hospitals will always take second
place to the pursuit of another
independence referendum.

We are opposed to a second
independence referendum and stand
with the majority of people in Scotland,
who do not want to return to division
and uncertainty. Nicola Sturgeon

and the SNP promised that the 2014
referendum would be a ‘once ina
generation’ vote and the result was
decisive. We believe that outcome
should be respected.

oo

Only the Scottish Conservatives can
block a Sturgeon/Corbyn alliance

and stop a second independence
referendum, so that we can get Brexit
sorted and Scotland can move on
from uncertainty and division.

>» Apost-Brexit deal for Scottish
fishing: As outlined above, we will
leave the Common Fisheries Policy,
become an independent coastal
state, and take back control of our
waters in December 2020.

Alcohol Duty Review: Scotch whisky is
a national export that supports 42,000
jobs across the UK. Yet the tax on each
bottle of Scotch sold in this country
represents almost three quarters of
its price. That is why over the past two
years we have frozen the duty on spirits,
cutting the price of a bottle of Scotch
by 30p. Now, we want to do more,
which is why we will review alcohol
duty to ensure that our tax system is
supporting British drink producers.

Oil and gas sector deal: The oil

and gas industry employs almost
300,000 people, of whom four in 10
work in Scotland. We believe that
the North Sea oil and gas industry
has a long future ahead and know
the sector has a key role to play as
we move to a Net Zero economy.
We will support this transition

in the next Parliament with a
transformational sector deal.

 

Investing in Wales

In the 2016 referendum, Wales voted
to Leave — yet the Welsh Labour
Government and Plaid Cymru are
intent on overturning that decision
by holding another referendum on
our membership of the EU.

Only the Welsh Conservatives can
end the current uncertainty by
delivering on the democratic decision
of the Welsh people to Leave — getting
Brexit done so we can unleash Wales's
potential as part of the United
Kingdom.

We are ambitious for the Welsh
economy and for our Union. We

will ensure that Wales gets a fair
deal, with major investments in
infrastructure and industry to deliver
real opportunity across the nation.

After Brexit, we will continue to be
a champion for Welsh exports and
Wales’s presence on the global stage
as part of a strong United Kingdom.

> Marches Growth Deal: Too often
infrastructure is focused on
national connectivity within
England and within Wales, rather
than across the communities
which live and work near the
border. We will work with the Welsh
Government and councils on both
sides of the border to negotiate

»

»

a transformative Marches Growth
Deal, focusing on cross-border
infrastructure which supports the
local and cross-border economy.
This will be modelled on the
successful collaboration between
governments and councils through
the Borderlands Growth Deal in
Northern England and the South of
Scotland — building on the work of
the Western Gateway partnership
we have already announced.

Transport: To support our Union, we
will upgrade the A55 as the main road
transport artery for North Wales —
improving its capacity and resilience
to build connections between Wales
and the rest of the United Kingdom.
A Welsh Conservative Government
would deliver the M4 relief road which
has been mothballed by the Labour
administration. We gave financial
support to the Welsh Government to
build the relief road, yet the Labour
administration decided to abandon
those plans out of timidity. This

road is a vital economic lifeline and
its cancellation shows that Wales is
continually being held back by the
Labour Welsh Government. We will
also deliver on our commitment to
fund the building of the West Wales
Parkway Station outside of Swansea.

Automotive industry: The
automotive industry in Wales
sustains tens of thousands of jobs

and we believe that it has a bright
future ahead. In September, we
worked to bring INEOS Automotive
to Bridgend, which will create 500
new jobs. We will continue to back
Welsh car manufacturing, as the
industry transitions to building
electric vehicles in the coming
decades.

> Welsh language: Conservatives
are proud of Welsh language and
culture. We will support Welsh
institutions such as S4C, the
National Library and Museum, the
Urdd and the National Eisteddfod.
We will support the ambition for
one million people in Wales to be
able to speak Welsh by 2050.

Protect our
democracy

As Conservatives, we stand for
democracy and the rule of law. Our
independent courts and legal system
are respected throughout the world.

One of the strengths of the UK’s
constitution is its ability to evolve — as
times have changed, so have Parliament,
government and the judiciary.

Today, that need is greater than ever. The
failure of Parliament to deliver Brexit

— the way so many MPs have devoted
themselves to thwarting the democratic

47

decision of the British people in the
2016 referendum — has opened up a
destabilising and potentially extremely
damaging rift between politicians and
people. If the Brexit chaos continues,
with a second referendum and a second
Scottish referendum too, they will lose
faith even further.

It is only by getting Brexit done that we
can start the necessary task of restoring
public trust in government and politics:

> Wewill get rid of the Fixed Term
Parliaments Act — it has led to
paralysis at a time the country
needed decisive action.

> Wewill ensure we have updated and
equal Parliamentary boundaries,
making sure that every vote counts the
same — a cornerstone of democracy.

> Wewill continue to support the First
Past the Post system of voting, as it
allows voters to kick out politicians
who don't deliver, both locally and
nationally.

> Wewill protect the integrity of
our democracy, by introducing
identification to vote at polling
stations, stopping postal vote
harvesting and measures to prevent
any foreign interference in elections.

48

We will make it easier for British
expats to vote in Parliamentary
elections, and get rid of the arbitrary
15-year limit on their voting rights.

We will maintain the voting age at
18 — the age at which one gains full
citizenship rights.

We will ensure that no one is put off
from engaging in politics or standing
in an election by threats, harassment
or abuse, whether in person or online.

We will champion freedom of
expression and tolerance, both in the
UKand overseas.

To support free speech, we will
repeal section 40 of the Crime
and Courts Act 2014, which seeks
to coerce the press. We will not
proceed with the second stage of
the Leveson Inquiry.

We will ensure redundancy payments
can be clawed back when high-paid
public servants move between jobs.

We will improve the use of data, data
science and evidence in the process
of government.

Once we get Brexit done, Britain will take
back control of its laws. As we end the
supremacy of European law, we will be
free to craft legislation and regulations
that maintain high standards but which
work best for the UK. We want a balance
of rights, rules and entitlements that
benefits all the people and all the parts of
our United Kingdom.

After Brexit we also need to look

at the broader aspects of our
constitution: the relationship between
the Government, Parliament and the
courts; the functioning of the Royal
Prerogative; the role of the House

of Lords; and access to justice for
ordinary people. The ability of our
security services to defend us against
terrorism and organised crime is
critical. We will update the Human
Rights Act and administrative law to
ensure that there is a proper balance
between the rights of individuals, our
vital national security and effective
government. We will ensure that
judicial review is available to protect
the rights of the individuals against an
overbearing state, while ensuring that
it is not abused to conduct politics by
another means or to create needless
delays. In our first year we will set

up a Constitution, Democracy &
Rights Commission that will examine
these issues in depth, and come

up with proposals to restore trust

in our institutions and in how our
democracy operates.

We Will Strengthen
Britain In The World

As Conservatives, we are immensely proud of the UK's history and its standing in the world.
Unlike those currently leading the Labour Party, we view our country as a force for good.

The strength of the Armed Forces, our alliances with like-minded democracies and our
willingness to act are all reasons for the UK to hold its head high.

So too is our work in promoting international development and fighting climate change —
both issues on which the Conservative Party and Conservative Governments have driven

the agenda forward.

And in an uncertain world, in which
the threat of terrorism, rogue states
and malign non-state actors is ever-
present, it is vital that Britain stands
up and is counted.

Getting Brexit done will allow us to do
more on the international stage. We

will continue to be an outward-looking
country that is a champion of collective
security, the rule of law, human rights,
free trade, anti-corruption efforts anda
rules-based international system.

After Brexit, we will bolster the alliances
and institutions that help project our
influence and keep us safe: the UN and

the UN Security Council; NATO; the
Commonwealth; Five Eyes; the G20; the
G7; and the World Trade Organisation.
We will open new markets and support
free trade and global growth.

We will build on our fantastic track
record of delivering major international
sporting events — including supporting
the upcoming Commonwealth

Games, UEFA European Women’s
Championships and Rugby League
World Cup — and we would back a
potential UK and Ireland bid for the 2030
FIFA World Cup.

As we extend our diplomatic network,
we will reinvigorate relationships with
Europe and seek to strengthen old and
new partnerships across the world. We
will work with our cultural institutions like
the BBC and British Council to expand
our influence and project our values. And
unlike Jeremy Corbyn, we will stand up
to foreign countries that threaten the
stability of Europe, or commit state-
sanctioned murder on British soil.

in ambitious global programmes,
including building the new Type 31

as Rosyth and a new generation of
armoured vehicles, made in Britain.

Promote our
values

From helping to end the slave trade to
tackling modern slavery, the UK has
long been a beacon of freedom and
human rights — and will continue to be
so. We are proud of our peace-building
and humanitarian efforts around

the world, particularly in war-torn or
divided societies, and of our record in
helping to reduce global poverty. We
will continue to support international
initiatives to achieve reconciliation,
stability and justice across the world,
and in current or former conflict zones
such as Cyprus, Sri Lanka and the
Middle East, where we maintain our
support for a two-state solution.

Once we leave the EU, we will
champion these values even more
strongly.

> Wewill further develop an
independent Magnitsky-style
sanctions regime to tackle human
rights abusers head on.

>» Wewill stand up for the right of
every girl in the world to have 12
years of quality education.

>» Wewill continue our campaigns to
promote international media freedom
and to eradicate human trafficking
and the scourge of modern slavery.

those persecuted for their faith
and implement the Truro Review

> Wewill proudly maintain our
commitment to spend 0.7 per cent
of GNI on development, and do
more to help countries receiving aid
become self-sufficient.

Fight climate
change and
protect the
environment

Conservation is, and always has
been, at the heart of Conservatism.
Our Government's stewardship of
the natural environment, its focus
on protecting the countryside and
reducing plastic waste, is a source of
immense pride.

But today, the climate emergency
means that the challenges we face
stretch far beyond our borders.

Thanks to the efforts of successive
Governments, the UK has cut carbon
emissions by more than any similar
developed country. We are now the
world’s leader in offshore wind — a
fantastic success story of Government
and the private sector working hand

in hand to cut costs and deliver ever
more electricity at plummeting costs.

Unlike Jeremy Corbyn, we believe
that free markets, innovation and
prosperity can protect the planet.

Yet we recognise that there is far more
that needs to be done.

> Wewill lead the global fight against
climate change by delivering on our

world-leading target of Net Zero
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,
as advised by the independent
Committee on Climate Change.

We have doubled International
Climate Finance. And we will use
our position hosting the UN Climate
Change Summit in Glasgow in 2020
to ask our global partners to match
our ambition.

> Wewill set up new international
partnerships to tackle deforestation
and protect vital landscapes and
wildlife corridors. We will establish a
new £500 million Blue Planet Fund to
help protect our oceans from plastic
pollution, warming sea temperatures
and overfishing, and extend the
Blue Belt programme to preserve
the maritime environment. We will
continue to lead diplomatic efforts
to protect 30 per cent of the world’s
oceans by 2030.

Our first Budget will prioritise the
environment: investing in R&D;
decarbonisation schemes; new flood
defences, which will receive £4 billion
in new funding over the coming
years; electric vehicle infrastructure
including a national plug-in network
and gigafactory; and clean energy.

In the next decade, we will work with
the market to deliver two million new
high quality jobs in clean growth. We
have ambitious targets:

Our world-leading offshore wind
industry will reach 40GW by 2030,
and we will enable new floating wind
farms.

Wewill invest £800 million to build the
first fully deployed carbon capture
storage cluster by the mid-2020s.

We will invest £500 million to help
energy-intensive industries move to
low-carbon techniques.

We will support gas for hydrogen
production and nuclear energy,
including fusion, as important parts of
the energy system, alongside increasing
our commitment to renewables.

We placed a moratorium on fracking
in England with immediate effect.
Having listened to local communities, we
have ruled out changes to the planning
system. We will not support fracking
unless the science shows categorically
that it can be done safely.

We will help lower energy bills by
investing £9.2 billion in the energy
efficiency of homes, schools and
hospitals.

We will support clean transport to
ensure clean air, as well as setting strict
new laws on air quality. We will consult
on the earliest date by which we can
phase out the sale of new conventional
petrol and diesel cars.

Increase trade
and prosperity

For the first time in nearly half a century,
the UK will have its own independent
trade policy once we leave the EU.

Free trade has been proven time and
again to be the best way to increase
exports, cut prices for consumers,
increase investment and create jobs
right here in the UK. We believe we
can use this historic opportunity to
connect the UK to the world’s fastest-
growing nations, create new export
opportunities and enrich ourselves
and our trading partners.

As part of the EU, we were forced into
accepting trade deals that put their
priorities first. Now, we will be able to
tailor our trade deals to the needs of
British firms and the British economy.

Our trade deals will not only be free
but fair — in particular towards the
developing nations whose economies
could be transformed by access to
the UK’s markets and expertise. We
can, for example, include provisions in
our new free trade agreements that
promote the fair treatment of workers
and advance women’s empowerment.

Our goals for British trade are
accordingly ambitious. We aim to have
80 per cent of UK trade covered by

free trade agreements within the next
three years, starting with the USA,
Australia, New Zealand and Japan.
These will be negotiated in parallel
with our EU deal.

We will also forge stronger links with
the Commonwealth, which boasts
some of the world’s most dynamic
economies such as India, with which we
already share deep historical and cultural
connections. We will use export finance
to increase our businesses’ access to
emerging markets and engage diaspora
communities in the UK with this agenda.

The UK is a world leader in many areas
such as architecture, engineering,
accountancy, information technology,
digital services, law and the creative
arts. Just as we led the way in opening
up trade in manufactured goods in
the last two centuries, we should
open up trade in services, in which the
majority of us work and where most
new jobs will be created.

As part of our commitment to making
the most of the opportunities of Brexit,
and levelling up the nation, we will create
up to ten freeports around the UK,
benefiting some of our most deprived
communities. We will also redouble our
efforts to promote British business and
UK exports and dismantle barriers to
trade and retake our seat at the World
Trade Organisation.

In our trade talks, we
will follow the following
principles:

We will seek to provide security
to the British people in a world
of heightened trade tensions and
Dele

We will seek to gain market
access for British businesses and
lower the cost of trade for them.

We will drive a hard bargain with
all of our trading partners — and,
Mita R-Mat-t-cel atl a Cola CMm MUM oY -3
prepared to walk away if that is in
the national interest.

We will defend British industries
from dumping and other anti-
competitive practices from
O11

In all of our trade negotiations, we
will not compromise on our high
environmental protection, animal
welfare and food standards.

We Will Put
You First

Getting Brexit done. Investing in our public services
and infrastructure. Supporting workers and families.
Strengthening the Union. Unleashing Britain’s potential.

The future is there for us to grasp.
Not a future in which we endlessly
refight the battles of Brexit and the
Scottish independence referendum,
or in which Jeremy Corbyn and John
McDonnell - propped up by Nicola
Sturgeon — lead a Government which
rejects everything that has made the
UK great.

The Conservatives offer a future in
which we get Brexit done, and then
move on to focus on our priorities —
which are also your priorities.

Because more important than any one
commitment in this manifesto is the
spirit in which we make them. Our job
is to serve you, the people. To deliver on
the instruction you gave us in 2016 — to
get Brexit done. But then to move on to
making the UK an even better country
— to investing in the NHS, our schools,
our people and our towns.

We will build a Britain in which
everyone has the opportunity to make
the most of their talents. We will ensure
that work will always pay. We will create
a fair society, in which everyone always
contributes their fair share.

Given the Parliamentary arithmetic, a
vote for any other party or candidate is
a vote for Jeremy Corbyn — and a vote
for chaos and delay.

We need to end the paralysis so we
can do our job in the way you deserve.
That is why we ask you to vote fora
Conservative majority Government on
December 12th.

So that together, led by Boris Johnson,
we can get Brexit done, and move on to
unleash the full potential of this great
country.

FOREWORD

This election is the most important this country has faced in my lifetime. Our future
prosperity, our place in the world, our standard of living, and the opportunities we want
for our children — and our children’s children — all depend on getting the next five years
right. If we fail, the consequences for Britain and for the economic security of ordinary,
working people across this country will be significant. If we succeed, the opportunities
ahead of us are great.

Now more than ever, Britain needs a strong and stable government to get the best deal
for our country. Now more than ever, Britain needs strong and stable leadership to
make the most of the opportunities Brexit brings.

I believe our United Kingdom can emerge from this period of great national change
stronger and more prosperous than ever before. I believe we can be a country that stands
tall in the world and provides leadership on some of the greatest challenges of our time.
I believe we can — and must — take this opportunity to build a Great Meritocracy here
in Britain.

The policies set out in the following pages will begin to build that stronger, fairer, more
prosperous Britain. They do not offer a quick fix. People are rightly sceptical of politicians
who claim to have easy answers to deeply complex problems. It is the responsibility of
leaders to be straight with people about the challenges ahead and the hard work required
to overcome them.

So this manifesto sets out a vision for Britain’s future — not just for the next five years,
but beyond. It identifies the five giant challenges we face and what we will do to address
them. In doing so, it offers a vision of the kind of country I want Britain to be.

A Britain in which every area is able to prosper, with a modern industrial strategy to
spread opportunity across the whole United Kingdom. A Britain in which work pays,
with a higher national living wage and proper rights and protections at work. A Britain
in which the economy is strong to support world-class public services, with the most
ambitious programme of investment in people, technology and buildings the NHS has
ever seen; record — and fair — funding for schools; and the first ever proper plan to pay
for —and provide — social care. And a Britain in which burning injustices are tackled and
overcome, with the first new Mental Health Bill for thirty years to put parity of esteem
at the heart of treatment and end the stigma of mental illness once and for all.

This is my plan for a stronger Britain and a prosperous future. It is a declaration of
intent: a commitment to get to grips with the great challenges of our time and to take
the big, difficult decisions that are right for Britain in the long-term.

 

FOREWORD

 

None of this will be easy. It will require discipline and focus, effort and hard work. It will
require leadership from a government that is strong enough to stand up for Britain, and
stable enough to steer the country safely through the negotiations ahead.

Above all, it will require a unity of purpose stretching across this precious union of
nations, from north to south and east to west. For as we embark on the momentous
journey ahead of us over the next few years, our shared values, interests and ambitions
can —and must — bring us together as a united country.

We can choose to say the task ahead is too great, to turn our face to the past and believe
it cannot be done; or we can look forward with optimism, believing the best days for
Britain lie ahead.

I choose to look forward: confident that we have the vision, the plan and the will to
use this moment to build a better Britain. A stronger Britain where everyone has the
economic security they need and the chance to live a secure and happy life. A fairer
Britain that works for everyone, not just a privileged few.

Theresa May
Prime Minister

FIVE GIANT CHALLENGES

Strong and stable leadership

Like generations before us, we are living through a time of profound national change. At
such moments, our country requires strong and stable leadership that is capable of taking
the right long-term decisions for the United Kingdom’s future security and prosperity.

 

Since the referendum result last summer, that is what the government has delivered.
Despite predictions of immediate financial and economic danger, we have seen
confidence remain high, record numbers of jobs and economic growth that has exceeded
all expectations.

A new Conservative government will stick to the plan that has delivered stability and
certainty. Over and above this plan, we know that we need to take the right long-term
decisions for our future security and prosperity. In doing so, we will make sure that
Britain not only meets the challenges of the future but grasps the opportunities these
challenges present.

Five giant challenges

This manifesto offers our vision for Britain not just for the next five years but for the years
and decades beyond. It is a programme for government but it is also a declaration that we
intend to achieve what few governments even attempt: we will take the big, sometimes
difficult, long-term decisions that are right for our future and for future generations.

For at this moment of national change, we believe that Britain faces five giant challenges,
each of which requires strong leadership, concerted effort and intelligent policy to
address.

1. Theneed forastrong economy. We need to make the most of our existing strengths,
invest in infrastructure and people, and ensure that the whole of our economy
across the whole of our country can grow. Without a strong economy, we cannot
guarantee our security, our personal prosperity, our public services, or contented
and sustainable communities.

2. Brexit anda changing world. We need to deliver a smooth and orderly departure from
the European Union and forge a deep and special partnership with our friends and
allies across Europe. As there is increasingly little distinction between domestic and
international affairs in matters of migration, national security and the economy, Britain
must stay strong and united — and take a lead in the world to defend our interests.

3. Enduring social divisions. For too many people, where you end up in life is still
determined by where you were born and to whom. We need to make sure that everyone

 

FIVE GIANT CHALLENGES

 

has the opportunity to make the most of their talents and hard work, whoever you are
and wherever you are from.

4. An ageing society. We need to respond to the reality of an ageing society, giving
people security in old age and caring for those with long-term health conditions,
whilst making sure we are fair to younger generations.

5. Fast-changing technology. For the sake of our economy and our society, we need to
harness the power of fast-changing technology, while ensuring that our security and
personal privacy — and the welfare of children and younger people — are protected.

Governing from the mainstream

If we do not take decisions now to address these challenges, our country risks becoming
weaker, poorer and less stable; but if we show leadership and grasp the opportunities
that these giant challenges present, Britain can emerge from Brexit, look beyond it and
launch into the future with confidence.

To do that, we will need to govern in the manner established by Theresa May since she
became prime minister last year. We must reject the ideological templates provided by
the socialist left and the libertarian right and instead embrace the mainstream view that
recognises the good that government can do.

Rather than pursue an agenda based on a supposed centre ground defined and established by
elites in Westminster, we will govern in the interests of the mainstream of the British public.
We will get on with the job and take Britain out of the European Union. We will restore the
public finances and maintain economic stability. We will reduce and control immigration. We
will be resolute in defending the country from terrorism and other security threats.

We will also stand up to those in positions of power who abuse that privilege. We will
run public services in accordance with their values as important local and national
institutions. We will not only guarantee but enhance workers’ rights and protections.
And we will develop our ambitious modern industrial strategy to get the economy
working for everyone, across the whole of our nation.

Under the strong and stable leadership of Theresa May, there will be no ideological
crusades. The government’s agenda will not be allowed to drift to the right. Our starting
point is that we should take decisions on the basis of what works. And we will always be
guided by what matters to the ordinary, working families of this nation.

We will govern in the interests of ordinary, working families

As Theresa May said when she first became prime minister, the work of the government
under her leadership will be driven not for the benefit of a privileged few but by the
interests of ordinary, working families: people who have a job but do not always have job

 

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

security; people who own their own home but worry about paying the mortgage;
people who can just about manage but worry about the cost of living and getting
their children into a good school.

These families have been ignored by politicians, and by others in positions of power,
for too long. Yet they do not ask for much: they want to get on with their lives, to do
their best for their children, to have a fair chance. Under Theresa May’s leadership,
they will no longer be ignored.

They are the people to whom this manifesto is dedicated. They are the people who
work hard every day and make this country what it is. And they are the people
who deserve strong and stable leadership from a government that is determined to
address the five giant challenges we face — and make the right long-term decisions
for the future of the United Kingdom.

We believe in the good that government can do

To do that, we will need a state that is strong and strategic, nimble and responsive
to the needs of people. While it is never true that government has all the answers,
government can and should be a force for good — and its power should be put
squarely at the service of this country’s working people.

If we are going to keep our economy strong as the world changes, we will need
government to play an active role, leading a modern industrial strategy to make
the most of Britain’s strengths and take advantage of new opportunities — bringing
secure, well-paid jobs to the whole of the country.

If we are going to make sure Britain emerges from Brexit as a strong and united
nation, we will need strong leadership and good government: to get the right deal
for Britain in Europe, to strike new trade deals around the world and to make sure
our economy is strong for the years ahead.

If we want to overcome Britain’s enduring social divisions, we will need to give
people real opportunity and make Britain the world’s Great Meritocracy. That will
require government to take on long-ignored problems like Britain’s lack of training
and technical education, as well as long-lasting injustices, such as the lack of care for
people with mental health problems, and the inequality of opportunity that endures
on the basis of race, gender and class.

If we are going to cope with our ageing society and if we want to give security to
people in old age while being fair to younger generations, we are going to need
positive, active government that will deal with increased demand for social care,
fund and improve our National Health Service and build more houses across the

 

FIVE GIANT CHALLENGES

 

country. We will need to take sometimes difficult decisions that ask more of one
generation in order to help another.

If we are going to respond to rapid changes in technology, we need government
to make Britain the best place in the world to set up and run modern businesses,
bringing the jobs of the future to our country; but we also need government to
create the right regulatory frameworks that will protect our security and personal
privacy, and ensure the welfare of children and younger people in an age when so
much of life is conducted online.

Government alone cannot solve every challenge our country faces. Without
business and enterprise, there would be no prosperity and no public services.
Without the obligations and duties of citizenship, society would not function.
Without individual responsibility, nothing can be achieved. But for a country
to remain stable, an economy to be strong, a society to stay healthy, we need a
partnership between the individual and the wider nation, between private sector
and public service, and the strong leadership only government can provide.

Our principles
We believe these things not despite the fact that we are Conservatives but because
we are Conservatives.

Because Conservatism is not and never has been the philosophy described by
caricaturists. We do not believe in untrammelled free markets. We reject the cult of
selfish individualism. We abhor social division, injustice, unfairness and inequality.
We see rigid dogma and ideology not just as needless but dangerous.

True Conservatism means a commitment to country and community; a belief not
just in society but in the good that government can do; a respect for the local and
national institutions that bind us together; an insight that change is inevitable and
change can be good, but that change should be shaped, through strong leadership
and clear principles, for the common good.

We know that our responsibility to one another is greater than the rights we hold
as individuals. We know that we all have obligations to one another, because that
is what community and nation demands. We understand that nobody, however
powerful, has succeeded alone and that we all therefore have a debt to others. We
respect the fact that society is a contract between the generations: a partnership
between those who are living, those who have lived before us, and those who are
yet to be born.

 

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

Avision of a stronger Britain and a prosperous future

If we allow ourselves to be directed by these principles, if we have strong and stable
leadership, and if we address the five giant challenges faced by Britain, we believe that
the future of our country is a bright one.

We are already the fifth largest economy in the world, the biggest recipient of foreign
investment in Europe and the fastest growing economy in the G7. We have three of the
world’s top ten universities and, despite forming less than one per cent of the global
population, we boast more Nobel Laureates than any country other than America. We
have the finest intelligence services and hugely respected armed forces that can project
power around the globe. We have the greatest soft power of any nation, we sit in exactly
the right time zone for global trade, our capital city is the global capital of finance and
culture, and our language is the language of the world.

So there is no doubt that a country as great as ours can—with strong and stable leadership
—rise to the giant challenges we face:

* to make sure our economy stays strong and to bring prosperity to the whole of our
country;

* to emerge from Brexit a strong and united nation, able to take a lead in the world to
defend Britain’s interests;

* to overcome social divisions by giving people real opportunity and making Britain the
world’s Great Meritocracy;

*  torestore the contract between the generations that provides security for older people
while being fair to the young; and

*  toseize the opportunities of changing technology, while ensuring that our security and
personal privacy — and the welfare of children and younger people — are still protected.

Britain is a great nation. We have a glorious history but we believe that our best days lie
ahead of us. With this plan to tackle the five giant challenges we face, with our proposals
to establish a stronger Britain and a prosperous future, we will, as a nation, go forward,
together.

1. ASTRONG ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE

 

Aw economy is the basis for everything we want to achieve as a
nation. If we are to have the prosperity, security and quality of life that
Britain desires, we need to have an economy that is vibrant and robust.

But our economy also needs to be equitable. For in Britain today, there is a division
between those people and places that have benefited from a changed global
market, where opportunity is displayed in affluence and a good quality of life;
and those people and places that have experienced a struggling economy, where
opportunity has receded and people worry about their children’s futures.

This is not right. So we will forge an economy that works for everyone in every part
of this country. We will found our plans on the principles of sound public finances,
low taxes, free trade and effective regulation. We will set rules for businesses that
inspire the confidence of workers and investors alike. That is only the foundation,
however. With our modern industrial strategy, we will build an economy that
invests for the long term and supports growth across the whole country — not
just in those places that have done well in the past few decades but also where
prosperity has waned. Governments cannot use public money to prop up failing
businesses, but they also cannot allow people and their communities to be cast
aside. It is our duty to bring opportunity to every part of our nation and to ensure
that we all prosper together.

 

THE FOUNDATIONS OF
A STRONG ECONOMY

Sound money and responsible public finances are the essential foundations of
national economic success. A government that cannot manage its money properly
cannot command confidence at home or with international investors. Firms and
households cannot plan ahead if the government’s thirst for their cash threatens higher
taxes and cuts to vital services and investment; and when things spiral out of control, it
is ordinary, working people who are hit hardest.

The Conservatives have laid these essential foundations. Ten years after the banking
crisis, the deficit is back to where it was. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility

forecasts that the national debt is finally about to start falling.

There is still work to do on deficit reduction, so we will continue to restore the public

 

13

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

finances over the course of the next parliament. We will continue with the fiscal rules
announced by the chancellor in the autumn statement last year, which will guide us toa
balanced budget by the middle of the next decade.

This is our foundation. The time has now come to focus on Britain’s next big economic
challenge: to foster growth that works for everyone, right across our country.

Keeping taxes as low as possible

Paying your fair share of tax is the price of living in a civilised democracy but politicians
should never forget that taxes are levied on businesses that employ people, and
individuals who work hard and face tough decisions about how they spend their money.

The Conservatives will always be the party that keeps tax as low as possible and spends
the proceeds responsibly. It is our firm intention to reduce taxes on Britain’s businesses
and working families.

By 2020, we will, as promised, increase the personal allowance to £12,500 and the higher
rate to £50,000. We will continue to ensure that local residents can veto high increases
in Council Tax via a referendum. And we will not increase the level of Value Added Tax.

Corporation Tax is due to fall to seventeen per cent by 2020 — the lowest rate of any
developed economy — and we will stick to that plan, because it will help to bring huge
investment and many thousands of jobs to the UK.

We know that the business rates system presents considerable challenges to some
smaller companies. That is why we have supported those businesses most affected by
the recent revaluation of business rates. That is not all we will do. We will make longer-
term reforms to the system to address concerns about the way it currently works. We
will make sure that revaluations are conducted more frequently to avoid large changes
to the bills that businesses face, and explore the introduction of self-assessments in the
valuation process. To ensure the system is sustainable for the future we will also conduct
a full review of the business rates system to make sure it is up to date for a world in which
people increasingly shop online.

A good tax system is not just about the headline rates of tax, however, but about its
simplicity. Our system remains too complicated, making it hard for people — especially
self-employed people and small businesses — to assess their taxes. We will therefore
simplify the tax system.

 

1. ASTRONG ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE

 

Increasing trade

Britain has always been a great trading nation. Trade will continue to be crucial to our future
growth and prosperity. As we leave the European Union, we want to negotiate a new deep
and special partnership with the EU, which will allow free trade between the UK and the
EU’s member states. As part of the agreement we strike, we want to make sure that there
are as few barriers to trade and investment as possible. Leaving the European Union also
means we will be free to strike our own trade agreements with countries outside the EU.

We will ensure immediate stability by lodging new UK schedules with the World Trade
Organization, in alignment with EU schedules to which we are bound whilst still
a member of the European Union. We will seek to replicate all existing EU free trade
agreements and support the ratification of trade agreements entered into during our
EU membership. We will continue to support the global multilateral rules-based trade
system. We will introduce a Trade Bill in the next parliament.

We will create a network of Her Majesty's Trade Commissioners to head nine new
regional overseas posts. These commissioners will lead export promotion, investment
and trade policy overseas. We will reconvene the Board of Trade with a membership
specifically charged with ensuring that we increase exports from Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland as well as England, and that trade policy is directly influenced by every
part of our United Kingdom.

We will work to forge a new culture of exporting among UK businesses, equipping them
with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed in the global marketplace, and
take advantage of new high-growth markets around the world.

We will take a more active role in supporting British consortia to win the largest and
most innovative contracts around the world. We will ensure that small and medium-
sized businesses are able to identify the right markets and sectors to win vital contracts
abroad. We will put UK Export Finance, which ensures that no viable UK export fails for
lack of finance or insurance, at the heart of the UK’s trade promotion proposition. And
we will encourage the world to visit, study and do business in the UK through the GREAT
Britain campaign and Visit Britain.

Effective regulation

Regulation is necessary for the proper ordering of any economy and to ensure that people —
and their investments — are protected. However, poor and excessive government regulation
limits growth for no good reason. So we will continue to regulate more efficiently, saving £9
billion through the Red Tape Challenge and the One-In-Two-Out Rule.

Reducing the cost of regulation is not just about reducing its volume. The wrong regulatory
frameworks can over-reward investors for the risk they are taking in backing a particular project,

 

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

meaning households and businesses can become systematically overcharged. We will therefore
examine ways in which the regulation of utilities and transport infrastructure can be improved
to deliver a better deal for customers and sharper incentives for investment efficiency.

NEW RULES FOR A CHANGING
ECONOMY

Conservatives believe that if you value something, you must be prepared to reform
it in order to conserve it. So it is today with our economy. Capitalism and free markets
remain the best way to deliver prosperity and economic security, lifting millions of
people out of poverty around the world. Markets need rules and these rules need to be
updated to reflect our changing economy.

Guar. anteeing a decent wage

We must first ensure that everyone is paid fairly for their work. It was a Conservative
government that introduced the National Living Wage and as a result, people across
the United Kingdom now receive a minimum of £7.50 an hour. A new Conservative
government will continue to increase the National Living Wage to 60 per cent of median
earnings by 2020 and then by the rate of median earnings, so that people who are on
the lowest pay benefit from the same improvements in earnings as higher paid workers.

Rights and protections in the ‘gig’ economy

Inthe modern economy many people choose jobs like driving, delivering and coding, that
are highly flexible and can be mixed with other employment. This brings considerable
advantages to millions of people but we should not ignore the challenges this kind of
employment creates. These workers are officially classed as self-employed and therefore
have fewer pension entitlements, reduced access to benefits, and no qualification for sick
pay and holiday pay. Yet the nature of their work is different from the traditional self-
employed worker who might be a sole trader, a freelancer or running their own business.

Wewillmake sure that people working in the ‘gig’ economy are properly protected. Last October,
the government commissioned Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the Royal Society of
Arts, to review the changing labour market. We await his final report but a new Conservative
government will act to ensure that the interests of employees on traditional contracts, the self-
employed and those people working in the ‘gig’ economy are all properly protected.

Stopping tax evasion

We have taken vigorous action against tax avoidance and evasion, closing the tax gap —
the difference between the amount of tax due and the amount collected — to one of the
lowest in the world.

 

16

1. ASTRONG ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE

 

We will now go further. We will legislate for tougher regulation of tax advisory firms. We
will take a more proactive approach to transparency and misuse of trusts.

We will improve HMRC’s capabilities to stamp down on smuggling, including by
improving our policing of the border as we leave the European Union. We will also take
further measures to reduce online fraud in Value Added Tax.

Protecting private pensions

Millions of people in this country look forward to a more secure retirement because of
their private pension. These pensions exist because employees have saved diligently
through their life, often foregoing luxuries and holidays abroad. Those people did the
right thing. Business owners who abuse pension funds and put them at risk, sometimes
for their own lavish enrichment, are entirely in the wrong.

The current powers of regulators and the Pension Protection Fund are insufficient to
ensure that pension savers, pensioners and prudent company directors are protected from
unscrupulous business owners. A Conservative government will act to tighten the rules
against such abuse, and increase the punishment for those caught mismanaging pension
schemes. We will build on existing powers to give pension schemes and the Pensions
Regulator the right to scrutinise, clear with conditions or in extreme cases stop mergers,
takeovers or large financial commitments that threaten the solvency of the scheme. We
will also give the Pensions Regulator new powers to issue punitive fines for those found
to have wilfully left a pension scheme under-resourced and, if necessary, powers similar
to those already held by the Insolvency Service to disqualify the company directors in
question. We will consider introducing a new criminal offence for company directors who
deliberately or recklessly put at risk the ability of a pension scheme to meet its obligations.

Reforming rules on takeovers and mergers

Conservatives believe in the rights of business owners. We want to be a global nation that
is competitive, outward-looking and open for business — the best country in Europe for
doing business.

We welcome overseas investment and want investors to succeed here but not when
success is driven by aggressive asset-stripping or tax avoidance. We will update the rules
that govern mergers and takeovers. This will require careful deliberation but we can state
now that we will require bidders to be clear about their intentions from the outset of the
bid process; that all promises and undertakings made in the course of takeover bids can
be legally enforced afterwards; and that the government can require a bid to be paused
to allow greater scrutiny.

We shall also take action to protect our critical national infrastructure. We will ensure that
foreign ownership of companies controlling important infrastructure does not undermine

 

17

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

British security or essential services. We have already strengthened ministerial scrutiny
and control in respect of civil nuclear power and will take a similarly robust approach
across a limited range of other sectors, such as telecoms, defence and energy.

Fair corporate pay

We believe people should be rewarded for their talents and efforts but the public is
rightly affronted by the remuneration of some corporate leaders. Senior corporate pay
has risen far faster than corporate performance, and the gap between those paid most
and those paid least has grown from 47:1 in 1998 to 128:1in 2015.

The next Conservative government will legislate to make executive pay packages subject
to strict annual votes by shareholders and listed companies will have to publish the
ratio of executive pay to broader UK workforce pay. Companies will have to explain their
pay policies, particularly complex incentive schemes, better. We will commission an
examination of the use of share buybacks, with a view to ensuring these cannot be used
artificially to hit performance targets and inflate executive pay.

Better corporate governance
The modern joint stock company is a British invention. It works because it is rules-based,
but the rules need to change as the world changes.

Boards should take account of the interests not just of shareholders but employees,
suppliers and the wider community. To ensure employees’ interests are represented at
board level, we will change the law to ensure that listed companies will be required either
to nominate a director from the workforce, create a formal employee advisory council or
assign specific responsibility for employee representation to a designated non-executive
director. Subject to sensible safeguards, we will introduce, for employees, a right to
request information relating to the future direction of the company.

These strengthened arrangements will apply to publicly-listed companies. We will consult
on how we might strengthen the corporate governance of privately-owned businesses.

A MODERN INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY

Our modern industrial strategy is designed to deliver a stronger economy that works
for everyone — where wealth and opportunity are spread across every community in the
United Kingdom, not just the most prosperous places in London and the south east. It
will help young people to develop the skills they need to do the high-paid, high-skilled jobs of
the future. And it will back Britain for the long term: creating the conditions where successful
businesses can emerge and grow, and helping them to invest in the future of our nation.

 

18

1. ASTRONG ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE

 

The strategy is not about picking winners, propping up failing industries, or bringing
back old companies from the dead. It is about identifying the industries that are of
strategic value to our economy and supporting and promoting them through policies
on trade, tax, infrastructure, skills, training, and research and development — just the
same as in every other major and growing economy in the world. It is about identifying
the places that have the potential to contribute towards economic growth and become
homes to millions of new jobs. And, because this is about meeting our economy’s long
term challenges, the industrial strategy will focus on creating the right institutional
framework to make the strategy last for decades to come.

We will spend more on research and development, to turn brilliant discoveries into practical
products and transform the world’s industries — such as the batteries that will power a new
generation of clean, efficient, electric vehicles. We will establish funding streams to ensure
investment for the long term, and make a modern technical education available to everyone,
throughout their lives, to provide the skills they need. We will remove the barriers that hold
backsmall firms with big potential—and let them compete when governmentitselfis the buyer.
We will build on the success of world-beating sectors such as car and aero manufacturing,
financial services, life sciences, digital technology and our creative industries, and help
other sectors develop the conditions which they need to thrive. We will ensure industry and
businesses have access to reliable, cheap and clean power. We will deliver the infrastructure
—the road, rail, airports and broadband — that businesses need.

Increasing innovation

Our long-term prosperity depends upon science, technology and innovation. The UK
has an outstanding science base and many world-leading tech companies. We now need
to go further. Our ambition is that the UK should be the most innovative country in the
world.

At the last autumn statement, we announced a significant increase in government
investment in research and development. We will deliver this and ensure further growth
so that overall, as a nation, we meet the current OECD average for investment in R&D
— that is, 2.4 per cent of GDP — within ten years, with a longer-term goal of three per
cent. We will increase the number of scientists working in the UK and enable leading
scientists from around the world to work here. We will work hard to ensure we have a
regulatory environment that encourages innovation.

University investment funds

Our world-beating universities will lead the expansion of our R&D capacity. We must
help them make a success of their discoveries — while they have a number of growing
investment funds specialising in spin-outs, we have more to do to replicate the success
of similar university funds in the United States.

 

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

To fix that, we will work to build up the investment funds of our universities across the
UK. We want larger, aggregated funds to increase significantly the amounts invested in
and by universities.

We want universities to enjoy the commercial fruits of their research, through funds that
are large enough to list, thereby giving British investors a chance to share in their success.

National Productivity Investment Fund

If our modern industrial strategy is to succeed, it must address the UK’s slow productivity
growth and it must be funded properly from the start. So we have launched a new £23
billion National Productivity Investment Fund. The government will target this spending
at areas that are critical for productivity: housing, research and development, economic
infrastructure and skills. This will include £740 million of digital infrastructure
investment, the largest investment in railways since Victorian times, £1.1billion toimprove
local transport and £250 million in skills by the end of 2020. The National Productivity
Investment Fund will take total spending on housing, economic infrastructure and R&D
to £170 billion during the next parliament.

Future Britain funds

People have long talked about the need to create UK sovereign wealth funds. We will
now make this a central part of our long-term plan for Britain. We will create a number
of such funds, known as Future Britain funds, which will hold in trust the investments of
the British people, backing British infrastructure and the British economy. We anticipate
early funds being created out of revenues from shale gas extraction, dormant assets,
and the receipts of sale of some public assets. We will encourage pension funds with an
interest in joining Future Britain funds to do so.

The skills we need

As we set out in chapter three, the next Conservative government will give Britain
the technical education it has lacked for decades. This will take time but we must also
address the immediate needs of those sectors of the economy suffering shortages in
skills. We will make the immigration system work for these sectors, whilst ensuring that
we develop the skills we need for the future.

We will therefore ask the independent Migration Advisory Committee to make
recommendations to the government about how the visa system can become better
aligned with our modern industrial strategy. We envisage that the committee’s advice will
allow us to set aside significant numbers of visas for workers in strategically-important
sectors, such as digital technology, without adding to net migration as a whole.

However, skilled immigration should not be a way for government or business to avoid
their obligations to improve the skills of the British workforce. So we will double the

 

20

1. ASTRONG ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE

 

Immigration Skills Charge levied on companies employing migrant workers, to £2,000 a
year by the end of the parliament, using the revenue generated to invest in higher level
skills training for workers in the UK.

Backing small businesses

The Conservative Party is the party of enterprise and of the entrepreneur. We understand
that small businesses are the wellspring of growth. They form a key part of British life,
valued for their contribution to every community across the country. We will continue to
support small businesses through business rate relief and low taxation, and by reducing
the bureaucracy and regulation that prevents small businesses from flourishing.

As part of broader reforms to the business energy market, we will consult on how to
extend our safeguard tariff cap to micro-businesses.

Central government must play a role in supporting SMEs: across all government
departments, we will ensure that 33 per cent of central government purchasing will
come from SMEs by the end of the parliament. As part of our modern industrial
strategy, we will explore how government can do even more to support innovation by
small and start-up firms. We also recognise that government can improve the general
business environment for SMEs, so we will use our buying power to ensure that big
contractors comply with the Prompt Payment Code both on government contracts
and in their work with others. If they do not do so, they will lose the right to bid for
government contracts.

Supporting industries to succeed

Our modern industrial strategy is not about ‘planning’ the economy. It is about helping
old industries find prosperous new life and unlock future opportunities, and new
industries to grow.

Some industries have a great history. We believe they can have a great future too. We have
already demonstrated that in advanced manufacturing, such as aero and automotive
engineering, we can lead the world. We will continue to support these key industries
so that they can grow further. We want to replicate that success in other sectors — like
shipbuilding where, for the first time in decades, there is the prospect of a renaissance.
We will take forward Sir John Parker’s review of shipbuilding, helping our shipyards
modernise and collaborate. We want to see shipbuilding growing on the Clyde and on
the Forth, in Belfast and in Barrow, and in the north-east and south of England.

Other industries, like the oil and gas sector, are transforming. The North Sea has provided
more than £300 billion in tax revenue to the UK economy and supports thousands of
highly-skilled jobs across Britain. We will ensure that the sector continues to play a
critical role in our economy and domestic energy supply, supporting further investment

 

21

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

in the UK’s natural resources. We will continue to support the industry and build on the
unprecedented support already provided to the oil and gas sector. While there are very
significant reserves still in the North Sea, it is expected to be the first major oil and gas
basin in the world to decommission fully, and we will take advantage of that to support
the development of a world-leading decommissioning industry. We will work with the
industry to create a multi-use yard and the UK’s first ultra-deep water port to support
this industry.

Other industries are already highly successful. Life sciences, for example, employs
175,000 people and many of the world’s top medicines have been developed in the UK.
We will continue to support research into the diagnosis and treatment of rare cancers
and other diseases, including Genomics England’s work in decoding 100,000 genomes.
This, together with the development of stronger research links with the NHS, can help
scientists and doctors design more effective and personalised treatments, and help
maintain our position as the European hub for life sciences.

Competitive and affordable energy costs

A successful industrial strategy requires competitive and affordable energy costs. We
want to make sure that the cost of energy in Britain is internationally competitive, both
for businesses and households.

We will therefore commission an independent review into the Cost of Energy, which will
be asked to make recommendations as to how we can ensure UK energy costs are as low
as possible, while ensuring a reliable supply and allowing us to meet our 2050 carbon
reduction objective.

Our ambition is that the UK should have the lowest energy costs in Europe, both for
households and businesses. So as we upgrade our energy infrastructure, we will do it in
an affordable way, consistent with that ambition. And because for British companies, an
energy-efficient business is a more competitive business, we will establish an industrial
energy efficiency scheme to help large companies install measures to cut their energy
use and their bills.

A diverse energy mix

We want to see a diverse range of sources for Britain’s energy production, because a
diverse energy economy is the best way to stimulate innovation, and also to ensure
that we are getting the right generation in the right place. For instance, while we do
not believe that more large-scale onshore wind power is right for England, we will
maintain our position as a global leader in offshore wind and support the development
of wind projects in the remote islands of Scotland, where they will directly benefit
local communities.

 

22

1. ASTRONG ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE

 

Above all, we believe that energy policy should be focused on outcomes rather than the
means by which we reach our objectives. So, after we have left the European Union, we
will form our energy policy based not on the way energy is generated but on the ends
we desire — reliable and affordable energy, seizing the industrial opportunity that new
technology presents and meeting our global commitments on climate change.

Natural gas from shale

The discovery and extraction of shale gas in the United States has been a revolution. Gas
prices have fallen, driving growth in the American economy and pushing down prices
for consumers. The US has become less reliant on imported foreign energy and is more
secure as a result. And because shale is cleaner than coal, it can also help reduce carbon
emissions. We believe that shale energy has the potential to do the same thing in Britain,
and could play a crucial role in rebalancing our economy.

We will therefore develop the shale industry in Britain. We will only be able to do so if
we maintain public confidence in the process, if we uphold our rigorous environmental
protections, and if we ensure the proceeds of the wealth generated by shale energy are
shared with the communities affected.

We will legislate to change planning law for shale applications. Non-fracking drilling
will be treated as permitted development, expert planning functions will be established
to support local councils, and, when necessary, major shale planning decisions will be
made the responsibility of the National Planning Regime.

We will set up a new Shale Environmental Regulator, which will assume the relevant
functions of the Health and Safety Executive, the Environment Agency and the Department
for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. This will provide clear governance and
accountability, become a source of expertise, and allow decisions to be made fairly but swiftly.

Finally, we will change the proposed Shale Wealth Fund so a greater percentage of the tax
revenues from shale gas directly benefit the communities that host the extraction sites.
Where communities decide that it is right for them, we will allow payments to be made
directly to local people themselves. A significant share of the remaining tax revenues will
be invested for the benefit of the country at large.

Investing in transport

We are working through one of the largest-ever investment programmes in our roads
and railways, putting some £40 billion into transport improvements across the United
Kingdom over the rest of this decade.

We are investing to reduce travel time and cost, increase capacity and attract investment
here in the UK. We will continue our programme of strategic national investments,

 

23

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

including High Speed 2, Northern Powerhouse Rail and the expansion of Heathrow
Airport — and we will ensure that these great projects do as much as possible to develop
the skills and careers of British workers.

We will continue to develop the strategic road network, providing extra lanes on our
motorways and improving key routes whilst also paying attention to parts of the country
left behind because of poor transport connections. We will continue to invest in roads to
fix pinch points and open up opportunities for new housing and local growth.

Our ambition is for Britain to lead the world in electric vehicle technology and use.
We want almost every car and van to be zero-emission by 2050 — and will invest £600
million by 2020 to help achieve it. We will invest in more low-emission buses, as well as
supporting audio-visual displays for bus passengers and community minibuses for rural
areas poorly served by public transport.

We will focus on creating extra capacity on the railways, which will ease overcrowding,
bring new lines and stations, and improve existing routes — including for freight. We will
increase services on our main lines and commuter routes, and launch new services to
places which are poorly served or host major new housing projects.

We will continue to support local authorities to expand cycle networks and upgrade
facilities for cyclists at railway stations.

STRONGER COMMUNITIES
FROM A STRONGER ECONOMY

Prosperous towns and cities across Britain

We have seen welcome growth and civic renewal in some major cities. There remains,
however, a far greater gap between the capital and other cities in the UK than in any
other major developed country. We see the opportunity to close this gap as the biggest
prize in Britain today. It will be a great endeavour by government, business and civic
society over many years. We are determined to lead the way in the next parliament.

First, we recognise the value of institutions to the vitality of towns and cities. As we explain
in chapter two, it is why we are determined to move many of the functions of central
government out to cities around Britain where possible and to see our vast cultural assets
reach people around our country too. It is also why we will support local growth through
combined authorities, mayoralties and local enterprise partnerships. We will make
each partnership and combined authority responsible for co-ordinating their own local

 

24

1. ASTRONG ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE

 

industrial strategy in alignment with our national industrial strategy, bringing together local
businesses, political and public sector leaders to drive growth and economic regeneration.
We will wherever possible deliver growth funding through these organisations. We will
give local enterprise partnerships greater weight by backing them in law.

Our institutions of education, old and new, will be critical to spreading success. It is why
we will back new scientific and technical institutions. It is why we want to see universities
make their full contribution to their local community and economy, sponsoring local
schools and being creative about how they can open up opportunities for local people,
especially those from ordinary working backgrounds.

Our towns and cities excel when they have vibrant cultural life. Britain’s arts and culture
are world-beating and are at the heart of the regeneration of much of modern Britain. We
will continue our strong support for the arts, and ensure more of that support is based
outside London. We will maintain free entry to the permanent collections of our major
national museums and galleries. We will introduce a new cultural development fund to use
cultural investment to turn around communities. We will hold a Great Exhibition of the
North in 2018, to celebrate amazing achievements in innovation, the arts and engineering.
We will support a UK city in making a bid to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games. And in
this 7oth Anniversary Year of the Edinburgh Festival we will support the development of
the new Edinburgh Concert Hall, reaffirming Edinburgh as the UK’s leading festival city
and a cultural beacon around the globe.

Our towns and cities should be healthy, well-designed and well-tended places. We will
take action against poor air quality in urban areas. In addition to the 11 million trees
we are planting across our nation, we will ensure that 1 million more are planted in our
towns and cities, and place new duties on councils to consult when they wish to cut
down street trees. We will encourage the very best practice in the design of buildings and
public spaces, including a review of the design of government buildings, to ensure that
when the state builds, it makes a positive contribution to a local area. We will do more to
reduce litter, including by supporting comprehensive rubbish collection and recycling,
supporting better packaging, taking new powers to force councils to remove roadside
litter and prosecuting offenders. We will do more to improve the quality of road surfaces,
filling potholes — especially in residential areas — and reducing road noise.

Our countryside communities

We will bring sustainable growth to the rural economy and boost our rural areas, so that
people who live in the countryside have the same opportunities as those who live in our
towns and cities.

We have huge ambitions for our farming industry: we are determined to grow more, sell
more and export more great British food. We want to provide stability to farmers as we

 

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

leave the EU and set up new frameworks for supporting food production and stewardship
of the countryside. So we will continue to commit the same cash total in funds for farm
support until the end of the parliament. We will work with farmers, food producers and
environmental experts across Britain and with the devolved administrations to devise a
new agri-environment system, to be introduced in the following parliament.

Our countryside and rural communities have been moulded by generations of farmers.
We will help Natural England to expand their provision of technical expertise to farmers
to deliver environmental improvements on a landscape scale, from enriching soil fertility
to planting hedgerows and building dry stone walls. We will deliver on our commitment
to improve natural flood management, such as improving the quality of water courses to
protect against soil erosion and damage to vulnerable habitats and communities. We will
continue to ensure that public forests and woodland are kept in trust for the nation, and
provide stronger protections for our ancient woodland.

We will continue to take action to improve animal welfare. We will implement
our proposed reforms on pet sales and licensing and will make CCTV recording in
slaughterhouses mandatory. As we leave the European Union, we can take early steps to
control the export of live farm animals for slaughter.

We will also take steps to enhance the provision of public services in rural areas. We
will safeguard the post office network, to protect existing rural services and work with
the Post Office to extend the availability of business and banking services to families
and small businesses in rural areas. A third of all SMEs in rural areas use their post
office weekly and our ambition is that all routine small business and consumer banking
services should be available in rural post offices. We will support pharmacies and village
schools in rural areas.

We will grant a free vote, on a government bill in government time, to give parliament the
opportunity to decide the future of the Hunting Act.

Finally, we pledge to be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than
we inherited it. That is why we shall produce a comprehensive 25 Year Environment Plan
that will chart how we will improve our environment as we leave the European Union
and take control of our environmental legislation again.

Our coastal communities

Decades of profound economic change have left their mark on coastal communities
around Britain. We will continue to work to ensure these communities enjoy the
vitality and opportunity they deserve. In England, we will extend our successful Coastal
Communities Fund to 2022, helping our seaside towns thrive.

 

26

1. ASTRONG ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE

 

When we leave the European Union and its Common Fisheries Policy, we will be fully
responsible for the access and management of the waters where we have historically
exercised sovereign control. A new Conservative government will work with the
fishing industry and with our world-class marine scientists, as well as the devolved
administrations, to introduce a new regime for commercial fishing that will preserve and
increase fish stocks and help to ensure prosperity for a new generation of fishermen. To
provide complete legal certainty to our neighbours and clarity during our negotiations
with the European Union, we will withdraw from the London Fisheries Convention. We
will continue our work to conserve the marine environment off the coast of the United
Kingdom.

30

2. ASTRONG AND UNITED NATION IN A CHANGING WORLD

 

he United Kingdom is embarking upon another era in our centuries-old

story. We are leaving the European Union. We want to ensure our departure
is smooth and orderly and to agree a deep and special partnership with the 27
remaining member states.

In leaving the European Union, we have chosen a truly global role for Britain. To
strike trade deals with old friends and new partners and take a leading position in
the world to defend British interests, we must be strong and united.

This begins with our determination to defend the integrity of the United Kingdom
and to strengthen the Union, bringing the peoples of the United Kingdom together.

 

OUR PRECIOUS UNION

We are a United Kingdom, one nation made of four — the most successful political
union in modern history. Its very existence recognises the value of unity — England,
Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales achieve less as two, three, or four, than as the
United Kingdom together. This unity between our nations and peoples gives us the
strength to change things for the better, for everyone, with a scale of ambition we simply
could not possess alone.

The settlement governing these islands has changed profoundly in the last twenty
years. Significant decision-making have been devolved to the parliament in Scotland
and assemblies in Wales and Northern Ireland. Devolved administrations in Edinburgh,
Cardiff and Belfast exercise greater powers than equivalent governments elsewhere in
the democratic world. In England, we have given considerable powers to city mayors
and combined authorities, while local councils now have greater control of the taxes
they collect.

This positive evolution of our constitution has given a voice to people who felt distant
from the centre of power, and responsibility to people for their own part of our
great country. We will continue to work in partnership with the Scottish and Welsh
governments and the Northern Ireland Executive, in a relationship underpinned
by pooling and sharing resources through the Barnett Formula. We will respect the
devolution settlements: no decision-making that has been devolved will be taken back
to Westminster. Indeed, we envisage that the powers of the devolved administrations
will increase as we leave the EU. However, we can still do more for the people of
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The United Kingdom Government has in the past tended to ‘devolve and forget’. This

 

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

Conservative government will put that right. We want the UK Government to be a force for
good across the whole country.

So we will be an active government, in every part of the UK. We will work closely with the
Northern Ireland Executive, the Scottish and Welsh governments, and the new devolved
authorities in England, for the benefit of all our people — but that will not be the limit of
our actions in the four nations. We are ambitious for everyone in Britain and will leave
no-one behind in our efforts to spread opportunity and prosperity throughout the United
Kingdom.

England

This Conservative government has devolved more power to English local authorities,
closer to local people, than any previous government in over a century: across England,
newly elected mayors, combined authorities, local councils and local enterprise
partnerships are being empowered to improve local growth and public services. We will
continue to give local government greater control over the money they raise and address
concerns about the fairness of current funding distributions.

With devolution now established in London and other parts of England, we will
consolidate our approach, providing clarity across England on what devolution means
for different administrations so all authorities operate in a common framework. We will
support those authorities that wish to combine to serve their communities better. For
combined authorities that are based around our great cities, we will continue to support
the adoption of elected mayors, but we will not support them for the rural counties.

Scotland

The Scottish Parliament has become the most powerful parliament of its kind in the
world, with extensive powers over taxation and welfare. It was the Conservative and
Unionist Party that delivered the 2012 and 2016 Scotland Acts, and only the Conservative
and Unionist Party can deliver further powers and the best possible deal for Scotland as
we leave the European Union.

The United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union but some would disrupt our
attempts to get the best deal for Scotland and the United Kingdom with calls for a divisive
referendum that the people of Scotland do not want. We have been very clear that now is not
the time for another referendum on independence. In order for a referendum to be fair, legal
and decisive, it cannot take place until the Brexit process has played out and it should not take
place unless there is public consent for it to happen. This is a time to pull together, not apart.

Scotland’s economic growth has lagged behind the rest of the United Kingdom in recent
years. The Scottish Government has the tools to drive economic growth in Scotland but
we take seriously our duty to secure prosperity for the whole of the United Kingdom.

 

 

A STRONG AND UNITED NATION IN A CHANGING WORLD

 

We will, therefore, take concerted action to help secure the long-term sustainability of
the Scottish economy. Scotland and Scottish industries will be central to our industrial
strategy.

We will continue our investment in capital and infrastructure projects in Scotland.
Building on the City and Growth deals we have signed across Scotland, we will bring
forward a Borderlands Growth Deal, including all councils on both sides of the border,
to help secure prosperity in southern Scotland. We will protect the interests of Scottish
farmers and fishermen as we design our new UK farming and fisheries policy. And as
we develop our new trade policies, we will pay particular attention to using the United
Kingdom’s muscle to promote Scottish exports around the world.

Wales

The Conservative Party has a proud record of promoting Welsh culture, helping
economic growth and supporting devolution in Wales. The 2017 Wales Act, passed by a
Conservative government, transfers significant new powers to the National Assembly for
Wales and the Welsh Government.

Wales plays a crucial role in our modern industrial strategy, in the promotion of growing
industries in Wales and in the additional powers handed to Welsh local authorities and
businesses to promote local growth. Welsh businesses will be central to our new trade
and export policies, and our investment in improved infrastructure will help Welsh
companies benefit even more from the UK single market than they do now. We will
modernise the railway infrastructure across Wales, including new and improved stations,
and explore ways to harness Welsh natural resources for the generation of power.

We will build on the Cardiff Capital region and Swansea Bay City region deals, and bring
forward a North Wales Growth Deal, connecting north Wales with northern England.
We will work with the Welsh Government to encourage further cross-border working,
ensuring that the border between England and Wales does not become a barrier to
business, education or communities. We will foster opportunities between cities in
Wales and the rest of the UK, such as linking economic development between Cardiff,
Newport and Bristol. We will protect the interest of Welsh farmers as we design our new
UK farming policy and work with the devolved administrations to ensure the strength of
the Welsh brand is maintained.

We will continue to support S4C as a part of a UK broadcasting structure and in its key
role promoting the Welsh language, which a Conservative government first protected.

Northern Ireland

Our steadfast belief remains that Northern Ireland’s future is best served within a
stronger United Kingdom.

 

33

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

Our commitment to the 1998 Belfast Agreement and its successors, together with the
institutions they establish, is undiminished. The next Conservative government will
therefore work to re-establish a strong, stable and inclusive executive at the earliest
opportunity. We will uphold the essential principle that Northern Ireland’s future should
only ever be determined by democracy and consent.

A Conservative government will work closely with an incoming executive to strengthen
the economy even further, to improve productivity, reduce public sector dependency and
promote Northern Ireland as a location for inward investment. We remain committed to the
devolution of Corporation Tax powers subject to the executive demonstrating fiscal stability.

As we leave the European Union we recognise Northern Ireland’s unique circumstances
and will seek to ensure that Northern Ireland’s interests are protected.

While the number of terror attacks from dissident republican terrorists has fallen from
forty in 2010 to four in 2016, the threat they pose remains severe and the need for vigilance
paramount. We will continue to confront and combat those who use violence, threats
and intimidation, providing the fullest possible support to the Police Service of Northern
Ireland and other agencies in their work to keep the public safe and secure.

A Conservative government will continue to work for the full implementation of the
2014 Stormont House and 2015 Fresh Start Agreements. This includes new bodies for
addressing the legacy of the past in fair, balanced and proportionate ways which do not
unfairly focus on former members of the Armed Forces and the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

The immense contribution of the security forces during the troubles should never
be forgotten. We will reject any attempts to rewrite history which seek to justify or
legitimise terrorism.

Shared institutions of Union

For too long, power in Britain has been centred in London. This means opportunity has
centred in London too. It is time major cities around Britain shared in the government
of the United Kingdom. For our civil service and major cultural bodies to claim to be UK
institutions, they need to represent and be present across our whole United Kingdom. It
is also wrong that while some of our major cultural institutions have made efforts to gain
a presence across the UK, others have not.

We will put this right. Starting with the UK Government's arm’s-length bodies, we will start
moving significant numbers of UK Government civil servants and other public servants out
of London and the south-east to cities around the UK. We will ensure that senior posts move
too, so that operational headquarters as well as administrative functions are centred not in
London but around Britain. And we will do so in a way that encourages the development of

 

34

2. ASTRONG AND UNITED NATION IN A CHANGING WORLD

 

new clusters of public services, private businesses and, where appropriate, universities.

We will proceed on the same basis with the arts and cultural organisations that give
our United Kingdom such strength. Channel 4 will remain publicly owned and will be
relocated out of London, and we will work with the nation’s most eminent museums and
galleries to ensure their works and expertise are shared across the country.

United Kingdom Shared Prosperity Fund

We believe in one nation — in helping every part of our country share in the prosperity
and opportunity of our great United Kingdom. Yet there is much to do. Current EU-wide
structural funding was designed to tackle disparities but it is expensive to administer
and poorly targeted. As we leave the European Union, we must look at how we can better
reduce and eliminate these inequalities.

We will use the structural fund money that comes back to the UK following Brexit to create
a United Kingdom Shared Prosperity Fund, specifically designed to reduce inequalities
between communities across our four nations. The money that is spent will help deliver
sustainable, inclusive growth based on our modern industrial strategy. We will consult
widely on the design of the fund, including with the devolved administrations, local
authorities, businesses and public bodies. The UK Shared Prosperity Fund will be cheap
to administer, low in bureaucracy and targeted where it is needed most.

LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION

Following the historic referendum on 23rd June 2016, the United Kingdom is leaving
the European Union. Only the Conservative Party, under Theresa May’s strong and stable
leadership, can negotiate the best possible deal for our country. In her Lancaster House
Speech, the prime minister laid out the twelve principles she intends to follow in seeking
a new deep and special partnership with the European Union. We have explained our
approach in the White Paper on the United Kingdom’s Exit from, and a new relationship
with, the European Union, during the passage of the European Union (Notification of
Withdrawal) Act, in the prime minister’s letter to the president of the European Council
invoking Article 50, and in the Great Repeal Bill White Paper.

We want to agree a deep and special partnership with the European Union. This
partnership will benefit both the European Union and the United Kingdom: while we
are leaving the European Union, we are not leaving Europe, and we want to remain
committed partners and allies to our friends across the continent.

The negotiations will undoubtedly be tough, and there will be give and take on both

 

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

sides, but we continue to believe that no deal is better than a bad deal for the UK. But
we will enter the negotiations in a spirit of sincere cooperation and committed to
getting the best deal for Britain. We will make sure we have certainty and clarity over
our future, control of our own laws, and a more unified, strengthened United Kingdom.
We will control immigration and secure the entitlements of EU nationals in Britain and
British nationals in the EU. We will maintain the Common Travel Area and maintain
as frictionless a border as possible for people, goods and services between Northern
Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Workers’ rights conferred on British citizens from
our membership of the EU will remain. We will pursue free trade with European markets,
and secure new trade agreements with other countries. We want to work together in the
fight against crime and terrorism, collaborate in science and innovation — and secure
a smooth, orderly Brexit. And we will protect the democratic freedom of the people of
Gibraltar and our overseas territories to remain British, for as long as that is their wish.
The final agreement will be subject to a vote in both houses of parliament.

As we leave the European Union, we will no longer be members of the single market or
customs union but we will seek a deep and special partnership including acomprehensive
free trade and customs agreement. There may be specific European programmes
in which we might want to participate and if so, it will be reasonable that we make a
contribution. We will determine a fair settlement of the UK’s rights and obligations
as a departing member state, in accordance with the law and in the spirit of the UK’s
continuing partnership with the EU. The principle, however, is clear: the days of Britain
making vast annual contributions to the European Union will end.

We want fair, orderly negotiations, minimising disruption and giving as much certainty
as possible — so both sides benefit. We believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our
future partnership alongside our withdrawal, reaching agreement on both within the
two years allowed by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.

Repatriating EU law to the United Kingdom

We will enact a Great Repeal Bill. Our laws will be made in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff
and Belfast, and interpreted by judges across the United Kingdom, not in Luxembourg.
The bill will convert EU law into UK law, allowing businesses and individuals to go about
life knowing that the rules have not changed overnight. This approach means that the
rights of workers and protections given to consumers and the environment by EU law
will continue to be available in UK law at the point at which we leave the EU. The bill will
also create the necessary powers to correct the laws that do not operate appropriately
once we have left the EU, so our legal system can continue to function correctly outside
the EU. Once EU law has been converted into domestic law, parliament will be able to
pass legislation to amend, repeal or improve any piece of EU law it chooses, as will the
devolved legislatures, where they have the power to do so.

 

36

2. ASTRONG AND UNITED NATION IN A CHANGING WORLD

 

As powers return from the EU, we will be able to determine the level best placed to take
decisions on these issues, ensuring that power sits closer to the people of the United
Kingdom than ever before. We expect that the outcome will be a significant increase in
the decision-making power of each devolved administration but we must also ensure
that as we leave the EU no new barriers to living and doing business within our own
union are created. In some areas, this will require common UK frameworks. We will
work closely with the devolved administrations to deliver an approach that works for
the whole of the United Kingdom and reflects the needs and individual circumstances of
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

As well as the Great Repeal Bill, we will bring forward a number of additional bills
to ensure that when we have left the EU there is a clear statutory basis for United
Kingdom authorities to exercise powers that are currently exercised through EU law and
institutions.

We will not bring the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights into UK law. We
will not repeal or replace the Human Rights Act while the process of Brexit is underway
but we will consider our human rights legal framework when the process of leaving the
EU concludes. We will remain signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights
for the duration of the next parliament.

GLOBAL BRITAIN

The United Kingdom is a global nation. Our history is a global history; our future must
be global too. We believe Britain should play an active, leading role in the world. Not
because it is our right or inheritance, but because our leadership in the world is the surest
way to defend and advance the interests of the British people, and to extend around the
world those values that we believe to be right.

The United Kingdom is already a global power. We have a leading diplomatic service
and one of the largest overseas development budgets in the world. Our armed forces are
respected around the world and enable us to project power globally. Our global businesses
and London’s position as the global centre of finance make us more interconnected with
the global economy than any other comparable nation.

Britain is already a significant influence for good around the world. Our aid is giving
millions an education and an opportunity to rise out of poverty. Our naval vessels are
stopping the vile trade in people and in drugs. We are at the forefront of action against
global climate change.

 

37

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

We can and should do more, not just because acting as a force for good is an important
end in itself but because the result will be greater peace and prosperity for the British
people. We will continue to champion British values around the globe: freedom,
democracy, tolerance and the rule of law. We will be the world’s foremost champion
of free trade. We will expand our global efforts to combat extremism, terror, and the
perpetration of violence against people because of their faith, gender or sexuality. We
will continue to lead international action against climate change, and the degradation of
habitat and loss of species. We will continue to lead a global campaign for the education
of women and girls, which is the key to progress in so many countries. We will lead the
fight against modern slavery, just as we overcame the trade in slaves two hundred years
ago. We will lead a global effort to close down online spaces for those who abuse children,
incite violence or propagate hate speech. We shall lead the world in the hard work to end
extreme child poverty and co-ordinate efforts against microbial resistance and emerging
tropical diseases. And we will take up leadership in a new arena, where concern is shared
around the world: we will be the global leader in the regulation of the use of personal
data and the internet.

British leadership in international institutions

Thesecurity and prosperity of the United Kingdomis built on the internationalinstitutions
that we helped to found and will continue to help maintain: the United Nations and the
UN Security Council, NATO — the cornerstone of our defence, the Commonwealth, the
G20, G7 and the World Trade Organization. We will continue to give strong support to
an international order in which rules govern state conduct; in our own behaviour we will
support this system and apply it in a principled way. We shall continue to seek to reform
multilateral institutions, especially in the way they distribute development funds, so that
money is used to greatest effect to protect and help the world’s most vulnerable people.

Global partnerships and alliances

Alongside our proposed deep and special partnership with the European Union, we will
maintain the historical, cultural and economic ties that link us to our old friends and
allies around the globe. We will build upon our existing special relationship with the
United States, and forge new economic and security partnerships that make us more
prosperous at home and more secure abroad. We will strengthen our close links with
our Commonwealth allies, continuing our mission together to promote democratic
values around the world and build on our existing economic relationships to further
our common trading interests. We will develop alliances and co-operate more with old
friends and new partners.

A global champion of free trade

The United Kingdom will be a global champion for an open economy, free trade, and the
free flow of investment, ideas and information. Open and free trade is key to international
prosperity, stability and security — it is an essential component of an economy that works

 

38

2. ASTRONG AND UNITED NATION IN A CHANGING WORLD

 

for everyone. We believe the UK must seize the unique opportunities it has to forge anew
set of trade and investment relationships around the world, building a global, outward-
looking Britain.

Promoting British culture around the world

The United Kingdom is home to some of the finest cultural institutions in the world.
We will continue to promote those institutions and ensure they have the resources they
need to amplify Britain’s voice on the world stage and as a global force for good. We will
continue to promote democracy, the rule of law, property entitlements, a free and open
media, and accountable institutions in countries and societies across the world.

We will place the BBC World Service and the British Council on a secure footing so they
are able to promote the best of British values around the globe and build strong ties
between our local communities and other countries.

Leading the world in development

British aid helps millions and is a powerful statement of Global Britain’s place in the
world. It protects our interests: by building a safer, healthier, more prosperous world,
we can protect our own people from disease, conflict and instability. This is the right
ambition for a country with a global outlook, so we will maintain the commitment to
spend 0.7 per cent of our gross national income on assistance to developing nations and
international emergencies.

We will continue to use our aid budget in alignment with the Sustainable Development
Goals, to end extreme poverty, save children’s lives, and provide an education for girls.
We will work to end the subjugation and mutilation of women, to combat the brutal slave
trade in fellow human beings and to prevent catastrophic environmental degradation.
And we will continue to lead global efforts to tackle sexual violence in conflict.

British scientists and inventors have helped to address some of the greatest challenges
facing the world’s poorest people. A global Britain should aspire to do even more: we
will significantly increase our funding of UK-led medical and technical research into the
biggest threats to global health and prosperity.

There are still ways that we can improve the way that taxpayers’ money is used to help
the world’s most vulnerable people. We do not believe that international definitions of
development assistance always help in determining how money should be spent, on
whom and for what purpose. So we will work with like-minded countries to change the
tules so that they are updated and better reflect the breadth of our assistance around the
world. If that does not work, we will change the law to allow us to use a better definition
of development spending, while continuing to meet our 0.7 per cent target.

 

39

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

Reforming asylum

We will ensure Britain remains a place of sanctuary for refugees and asylum seekers.
The existing system, however, is geared towards people who are young enough, fit
enough, and have the resources to get to Britain, rather than those who are most in
need of our help.

Wherever possible, the government will offer asylum and refuge to people in parts of
the world affected by conflict and oppression, rather than to those who have made it to
Britain. We will work to reduce asylum claims made in Britain and, as we do so, increase
the number of people we help in the most troubled regions. We will continue to work
with other countries in Europe, and the United Nations, to review the international legal
definitions of asylum and refugee status.

We will make sure our councils get the help they need to deal with people as they
arrive, and establish schemes to help individuals, charities, faith groups, churches and
businesses to provide housing and other support for refugees.

Protecting the global environment

The United Kingdom will lead the world in environmental protection. As Conservatives,
we are committed to leaving the environment in better condition than we inherited it.
That is why we will continue to take a lead in global action against climate change, as the
government demonstrated by ratifying the Paris Agreement. We were the first country
to introduce a Climate Change Act, which Conservatives helped to frame, and we are
halfway towards meeting our 2050 goal of reducing emissions by eighty per cent from
1990 levels.

We will champion greater conservation co-operation within international bodies,
protecting rare species, the polar regions and international waters. We will work with
our Overseas Territory governments to create a Blue Belt of marine protection in their
precious waters, establishing the largest marine sanctuaries anywhere in the world.

Modern slavery

The UK is a global leader in fighting the evil trade in human beings — both around the
world and in our own country — for sex and labour exploitation. As home secretary,
Theresa May brought forward the Modern Slavery Act, the first of its kind in Europe,
appointed the world’s first anti-slavery commissioner and set up the Modern Slavery
Taskforce to bring together the heads of MI5, MI6 and the National Crime Agency to co-
ordinate our response to criminal gangs operating across the world.

We now need to go further. We need to focus on the exploitation of vulnerable men,
women and children for their labour, people who are moved around our own country
and between nations, as if they were not human at all. We will review the application of

 

40

2. ASTRONG AND UNITED NATION IN A CHANGING WORLD

 

exploitation in the Modern Slavery Act to strengthen our ability to stop criminals putting
men, women and children into criminal, dangerous and exploitative working conditions.
And the UK will use its power to push the United Nations and other international bodies
to make Modern Slavery a thing of the past.

STRONG DEFENCE IN AN
UNCERTAIN WORLD

Our world is full of opportunity but is also riven by conflict, terrorism and threat.
As a global power, we have a responsibility to sustain our fine armed forces so that they
can defend the realm, our overseas territories and our interests around the globe. We
will play a leading role in NATO and maintain the ability to conduct strike operations,
peacekeeping, security missions and the deployment of a joint expeditionary force. We
will maintain the overall size of the armed forces, including an army that is capable of
fielding a war-fighting division. We shall expand our reach around the world. We will
retain the Trident continuous-at-sea nuclear deterrent to provide the ultimate guarantee
of our security.

We have the biggest defence budget in Europe and the second largest in NATO. We will
continue to meet the NATO commitment to spend at least 2 per cent of GDP on defence
and we will increase the defence budget by at least 0.5 per cent above inflation in every
year of the new parliament.

The finest servicemen and women

We will attract and retain the best men and women for our armed forces, including by
engaging them on a flexible basis. We will protect our brave armed forces personnel
from persistent legal claims, which distress those who risk their lives for us, cost the
taxpayer millions and undermine the armed forces in the service they give. Under a
Conservative government, British troops will in future be subject to the Law of Armed
Conflict, which includes the Geneva Convention and UK Service Law, not the European
Court of Human Rights. We will strengthen legal services regulation and restrict legal aid
for unscrupulous law firms that issue vexatious legal claims against the armed forces. We
will introduce better compensation for injured armed forces personnel and the families
of those killed in combat.

The best equipment for our armed forces

We plan to invest £178 billion in new military equipment over the next decade, creating
high-skilled jobs across the whole country. For the first time in a generation the Royal
Navy is growing. We have cut steel on the first of a new fleet of four Dreadnought ballistic
missile boats and we will complete the Astute class of hunter-killer submarines. Our

 

41

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

two new aircraft carriers will project British military power for the next fifty years: HMS
Queen Elizabeth begins sea trials in the summer and HMS Prince of Wales is due to enter
active service in 2020. Alongside our new Type 45 destroyers, we will build eight Type
26 anti-submarine frigates and develop our programme for a new class of lighter, general
purpose frigates so that by the 2030s we can further increase the size of our fleet. We
shall also deliver five Offshore Patrol Vessels.

For the Army we will deliver AJAX armoured vehicles, Apache attack helicopters, new
drones, new missile and bomb systems, and better equipment for the Special Forces. The
Royal Air Force will receive, with the Fleet Air Arm, the Lightning II strike fighter, as
well as new Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Taken together, this is the largest programme of
investment in our armed forces for generations.

Supporting our veterans

We will support former members of the armed forces, who were willing to risk their
lives for us, as they move into civilian life. We will maintain and strengthen the Armed
Forces Covenant. We will help veterans to start new careers by ensuring that the skills
and qualifications they gained in service are recognised by civilian employers and by
introducing a one year holiday on Employer National Insurance Contributions for firms
hiring service personnel after they leave service. We will improve the co-ordination of
government services to veterans, including housing, employment and mental health
services, by introducing a Veterans Board in the Cabinet Office.

THE HOME OF DEMOCRACY
AND THE RULE OF LAW

This election will decide the composition of our parliament, the oldest of all large
democracies. The laws that we make form the basis of judgments in our courts, which are
respected around the world. This unequalled democracy and legal system is our greatest
national inheritance. However, collective faith in our democratic institutions and our
justice system has declined in the past two decades. It is the purpose of this Conservative
Party, in responding to the historic vote on our membership of the European Union, to
re-establish faith in our democracy, and in our democratic and legal institutions.

A flourishing and secure democracy

Our democratic institutions may be ancient but should not be neglected. We will
continue to modernise and improve our electoral registration process, making it as
accessible as possible so that every voice counts. We will legislate for votes for life for
British overseas electors. We will continue with the current boundary review, enshrining
the principle of equal seats, while reducing the number of MPs to 600, similar to other

 

42

 

A STRONG AND UNITED NATION IN A CHANGING WORLD

 

Western democratic chambers. We will retain the first past the post system of voting for
parliamentary elections and extend this system to police and crime commissioner and
mayoral elections. We will retain the current franchise to vote in parliamentary elections
at eighteen. We will repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.

The British public deserves to have confidence in our democracy. We will legislate to
ensure that a form of identification must be presented before voting, to reform postal
voting and to improve other aspects of the elections process to ensure that our elections
are the most secure in the world. We will retain the traditional method of voting by pencil
and paper, and tackle every aspect of electoral fraud.

Although comprehensive reform is not a priority we will ensure that the House of Lords
continues to fulfil its constitutional role as a revising and scrutinising chamber which
respects the primacy of the House of Commons. We have already undertaken reform to
allow the retirement of peers and the expulsion of members for poor conduct and will
continue to ensure the work of the House of Lords remains relevant and effective by
addressing issues such as its size.

Celebrating public service

Our nation is made great by millions of people who work every day to serve the public.
Public service is a noble vocation, one which we will celebrate. We want the most
committed and capable people to come into public service, and for public services to be
motors of social mobility — which is why we are looking at ways to make sure civil service
recruitment is as diverse as possible, not only from the perspective of gender and race
but social class too.

We will continue to fund schemes to get graduates from Britain’s leading universities to
serve in schools, police forces, prisons, and social care and mental health organisations.
These programmes are now some of the UK’s largest graduate employers, taking the
brightest and best from our universities and using their talents to tackle entrenched
social problems. We want to go further. We will provide seed funding for similar schemes
to recruit older professionals from other sectors, including those returning to the
workplace having cared for children and relatives and those approaching retirement.

We know public services are dependent upon the public servants who run them,
which is why we will establish in law the freedom for employees to mutualise, where
appropriate, within the public sector. We will review the honours system to make sure it
commands public confidence, rewards genuine public service and that recipients uphold
the integrity of the honours bestowed.

Reforming the justice system
The last seven years have seen historic falls in crime and improvements in public safety.

 

43

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

We will build on that record.

A strong criminal justice system requires a good legal system. We cherish our strong and
independent judiciary. Our courts and judiciary are respected as the finest in the world.
Legal services are a major British export and underpin our professional services sector.
We will continue to modernise our courts, improving court buildings and facilities and
making it easier for people to resolve disputes and secure justice.

We will take action to make it harder for people to enter the country if they have a
criminal conviction and will implement satellite tracking for every foreign national
offender subject to an outstanding deportation order or deportation proceedings.

Standing up for victims

We will ensure that victims of crime are supported at every stage of the criminal justice
system. We will enshrine victims’ entitlements in law, making clear what level of service
they should expect from the police, courts and criminal justice system. We will ensure that
child victims and victims of sexual violence are able to be cross-examined before their
trial without the distress of having to appear in court. Publicly-funded advocates will have
specialist training in handling victims before taking on serious sexual offences cases. To
ensure that the pain and suffering of the Hillsborough families over the last twenty years is
not repeated, we will introduce an independent public advocate, who will act for bereaved
families after a public disaster and support them at public inquests. We will extend the
scope of the Unduly Lenient Sentence Scheme so a wider range of sentences can be
challenged. And we will push forward with our plan for tackling hate crime committed on
the basis of religion, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity.

Strengthening the police and security services

We will help Britain’s world-leading police forces and prosecutorial services to fight
crime, protect the public and provide security for businesses. We will create a national
infrastructure police force, bringing together the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, the
Ministry of Defence Police and the British Transport Police to improve the protection
of critical infrastructure such as nuclear sites, railways and the strategic road network.
We will strengthen Britain’s response to white collar crime by incorporating the Serious
Fraud Office into the National Crime Agency, improving intelligence sharing and
bolstering the investigation of serious fraud, money laundering and financial crime. We
will extend direct entry into the police, including at chief officer level. We will continue
to invest in our world-leading security services and maintain and develop our counter-
terrorism strategy to protect us from terrorism at home and abroad. And we will bolster
the response to cyber threats on private businesses, public services, critical national
infrastructure, and individuals, working with the National Cyber Security Centre to
prevent attacks wherever possible and with the police and international law enforcement
agencies to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice.

 

44

A STRONG AND UNITED NATION IN A CHANGING WORLD

 

 

We will widen the role of police and crime commissioners to help them cut crime for
their local communities. We will ensure that commissioners sit on local health and
wellbeing boards, enabling better co-ordination of crime prevention with local drug and
alcohol and mental health services. We will build on the Policing and Crime Act, which
introduced better co-ordination of policing and fire and rescue services, with greater
devolution of criminal justice responsibility and budgets to local commissioners.

Punishment and reform
Prisons should be places of reform and rehabilitation, but we should always remember
that incarceration is punishment for people who commit serious crimes.

The £15 billion annual cost to society of reoffending shows we have so much more to do
to make the penal system work better. Prisons must become places of safety, discipline
and hard work, places where people are helped to turn their lives around. They should
help prisoners learn English, maths and the work skills they need to get a job when they
leave prison, whilst providing the help prisoners require to come off drugs and deal with
mental health problems.

We will invest over £1 billion to modernise the prison estate, replacing the most
dilapidated prisons and creating 10,000 modern prison places. We will reform the entry
requirements, training, management and career paths of prison officers. We will create
a new legal framework for prisons, strengthening the inspectorate and ombudsman to
provide sharper external scrutiny.

Community punishments do not do enough to prevent crime and break the cycle of
persistent offending. So we will create a national community sentencing framework that
punishes offenders and focuses on the measures that have a better chance of turning
people around and preventing crime, such as curfews and orders that tackle drug and
alcohol abuse. We will introduce dedicated provision for women offenders.

48

3. THE WORLD’S GREAT MERITOCRACY

 

e have done much in recent years to break down longstanding

divisions in our country. Yet some social injustices endure. If you are
at a state school you are less likely to reach the top professions than if you are
educated privately. If you are a white, working-class boy, you are less likely than
anybody else in Britain to go to university. If you are black, you are treated more
harshly by the criminal justice system than if you are white. If you are born poor,
you will die on average nine years earlier than others. If you are a woman, you
will earn less than a man. If you suffer from mental health problems, there is not
enough help at hand. These are burning injustices that damage the unity of our
country, and we will address them.

The truth is that if we are to make Britain the world’s Great Meritocracy, we
also need to do much more to support millions of people who live in ordinary,
working families. Because life is often much harder for these families than many
in positions of power seem to realise. They might have a job, but not always job
security; they might be homeowners, but they worry about paying the mortgage
and wonder if their children will be able to afford a home of their own; they can
just about manage, but worry about the cost of living and getting their children
into a good school. They deserve a government that is on their side.

 

A COUNTRY FOUNDED ON MERIT

The greatest injustice in Britain today is that your life is still largely determined
not by your efforts and talents but by where you come from, who your parents are
and what schools you attend. This is wrong. We want to make Britain the world’s Great
Meritocracy: a country where everyone has a fair chance to go as far as their talent and
their hard work will allow, where advantage is based on merit not privilege. To succeed,
we must redouble our efforts to ensure that everyone, no matter who they are or where
they are from, can have a world-class education.

More good school places

We are proud of our reforms to education, which are giving millions of children a better
start in life than they could have expected a decade ago. Thanks to our school reforms
— such as the establishment of free schools and academies, and changes to ensure a
rigorous curriculum — there are more good and outstanding schools today than ever
before. There are now more than 1.8 million more children in schools rated good and
outstanding than in 2010. The proportion of pupils taking core academic subjects at
GCSE has almost doubled.

 

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

There remains a long way to go. For too many children, a good school remains out of
reach. There are still 1 million children in primary and secondary schools rated by Ofsted
as ‘requires improvement’ or ‘inadequate’. If schools across the Midlands and north of
England had the same average standards as those in the south, nearly 200,000 more
children would be attending good schools. We need to give every child in our country the
best possible education if we are to provide them with the best opportunities in the world.

To achieve that ambition we will have to go further in reforming our education system. So
we will continue with our programme of free schools, building at least a hundred new free
schools a year. We will prohibit councils from creating any new places in schools that have
been rated either ‘inadequate’ or ‘requires improvement’ by Ofsted.

We will make it a condition for universities hoping to charge maximum tuition fees to
become involved in academy sponsorship or the founding of free schools. We will introduce
new funding arrangements so we can open a specialist maths school in every major city
in England. We will replace the unfair and ineffective inclusivity rules that prevent the
establishment of new Roman Catholic schools, instead requiring new faith schools to
prove that parents of other faiths and none would be prepared to send their children to
that school. We will work with the Independent Schools Council to ensure that at least 100
leading independent schools become involved in academy sponsorship or the founding
of free schools in the state system, keeping open the option of changing the tax status of
independent schools if progress is not made.

We will lift the ban on the establishment of selective schools, subject to conditions, such
as allowing pupils to join at other ages as well as eleven. Contrary to what some people
allege, official research shows that slightly more children from ordinary, working class
families attend selective schools as a percentage of the school intake compared to non-
selective schools. While the attainment gap between rich and poor pupils stands at 25
per cent across the country, at selective schools it falls to almost zero.

These changes will have a great effect, but alone they cannot overcome the unfairness
of selection by house price, where ordinary, working class families find it difficult to
access the best schools because they cannot afford to live in the catchment area. We will
therefore conduct a review of school admissions policy. We will be clear at the outset that
we will never introduce a mandatory lottery-based school admissions policy.

Aknowledge-rich curriculum

Our reforms to what is taught in schools have been profound. We have addressed
grade inflation and poor standards and developed a world-class curriculum. This has
meant considerable change for pupils, teachers and schools. So now we will help them
consolidate those gains, starting with the early building blocks of learning.

 

3. THE WORLD’S GREAT MERITOCRACY

 

A Conservative government will strengthen the teaching of literacy and numeracy in the
early years so that all pupils — regardless of background — get the best possible start in life.
We will build on the success of the phonics screening test. We will expect every 11-year-
old to know their times tables off by heart. To maintain progress as children go through
secondary school, we will improve schools’ accountability at key stage 3. We will expect
75 per cent of pupils to have been entered for the EBacc combination of GCSEs by the end
of the next parliament, with 90 per cent of pupils studying this combination of academic
GCSEs by 2025.

We will ensure all children have access to an academic, knowledge-rich curriculum. We
will introduce a curriculum fund to encourage Britain’s leading cultural and scientific
institutions, like the British Museum and others to help develop knowledge-rich materials
for our schools, and we will ensure that assessments at the end of primary school draw
from a rich knowledge base, and reduce teaching to the test. We will consider how Ofsted
can give parents more information on what their children are being taught.

Supporting teachers

We want great people to become teachers, teach in our most challenging schools and
stay there. We will continue to provide bursaries to attract top graduates into teaching.
To help new teachers remain in the profession, we will offer forgiveness on student
loan repayments while they are teaching and bring in dedicated support to help them
throughout their careers.

We will provide greater support for teachers in the preparation of lessons and marking,
including through the use of technology, and we will bear down on unnecessary
paperwork and the burden of Ofsted inspections. We will create a single jobs portal, like
NHS Jobs, for schools to advertise vacancies in order to reduce costs and help them find
the best teachers.

Fairer funding

The way funding is distributed to schools in England is not fair. Across the country,
children with the same needs and expectations receive markedly different rates of funding
for their school place. We have begun to correct this and in the next parliament we will
make funding fairer still. We appreciate that it is hard for schools receiving a higher level of
funding to make cuts in order to pay for increases elsewhere, so while we will make funding
fairer over the course of the parliament, we will make sure that no school has its budget cut
as a result of the new formula. We will increase the overall schools budget by £4 billion by
2022, representing more than a real terms increase for every year of the parliament. We will
continue to protect the Pupil Premium to support those who need it.

In order to fund these commitments, we have taken an important decision. We do not
believe that giving school lunches to all children free of charge for the first three years

 

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

of primary school — regardless of the income of their parents — is a sensible use of public
money. There is now good evidence that school breakfasts are at least as effective in
helping children to make progress in school. So under a new Conservative government,
schools in England will offer a free school breakfast to every child in every year of
primary school, while children from low-income families will continue to receive free
school lunches throughout their years in primary and secondary education. The savings
made from this change will be added to the core schools budget, meaning that every
penny saved will go towards children’s education.

World-class technical education

For too long in this country, technical excellence has not been valued as highly as
academic success. We want British technical education to be as prestigious as our world-
leading higher education system, and for technical education in this country to rival the
best technical systems in the world.

This will require bold reform of the funding, institutional and qualifications frameworks
for technical education, in partnership with British industry. We have already introduced
high quality apprenticeships that can reach to degree level and beyond for the 200,000
young people who choose to enter full-time vocational study after their GCSEs each year.
We now need to go further to improve technical education and offer young people a real
choice between technical and academic routes at sixteen.

We will start by replacing 13,000 existing technical qualifications with new qualifications,
known as T-levels, across fifteen routes in subjects including construction, creative and
design, digital, engineering and manufacturing, and health and science. We will increase
the number of teaching hours by fifty per cent to an average of 900 hours per year and
make sure that each student does a three-month work placement as part of their course.
And we will extend our reforms to the highest levels of technical qualification.

We will invest in further education colleges to make sure they have world-class equipment
and facilities and will create a new national programme to attract experienced industry
professionals to work in FE colleges.

We will establish new institutes of technology, backed by leading employers and linked to
leading universities, in every major city in England. They will provide courses at degree
level and above, specialising in technical disciplines, such as STEM, whilst also providing
higher-level apprenticeships and bespoke courses for employers. They will enjoy the
freedoms that make our universities great, including eligibility for public funding for
productivity and skills research, and access to loans and grants for their students. They
will be able to gain royal charter status and regius professorships in technical education.
Above all, they will become anchor institutions for local, regional and national industry,
providing sought-after skills to support the economy, and developing their own local
identity to make sure they can meet the skills needs of local employers.

3. THE WORLD’S GREAT MERITOCRACY

 

To ensure that further, technical and higher education institutions are treated fairly, we
will also launch a major review of funding across tertiary education as a whole, looking
at how we can ensure that students get access to financial support that offers value for
money, is available across different routes and encourages the development of the skills
we need as a country.

We will put employers at the centre of these reforms. We will deal with local skills shortages
and ensure that colleges deliver the skills required by local businesses through Skills
Advisory Panels and Local Enterprise Partnerships working at a regional and local level.
We will deliver our commitment to create 3 million apprenticeships for young people by
2020 and in doing so we will drive up the quality of apprenticeships to ensure they deliver
the skills employers need. We will allow large firms to pass levy funds to small firms in
their supply chain, and work with the business community to develop a new programme
to allow larger firms to place apprentices in their supply chains. We will explore teaching
apprenticeships sponsored by major companies, especially in STEM subjects.

Lastly, we will make the system easier for young people taking technical and vocational
routes. We will introduce a UCAS-style portal for technical education. We will introduce
significantly discounted bus and train travel for apprentices to ensure that no young
person is deterred from an apprenticeship due to travel costs.

Career learning
We will in the next parliament produce the best programme of learning and training for
people in work and returning to work in the developed world.

We will help all workers seeking to develop their skills in their existing jobs by
introducing a new right to request leave for training for all employees. Alongside this,
we will help workers to stay in secure jobs as the economy changes by introducing a
national retraining scheme. Under the scheme, the costs of training will be met by the
government, with companies able to gain access to the Apprenticeship Levy to support
wage costs during the training period.

We will break down the barriers to public sector workers taking on more qualified roles
because of their prior educational attainment. For instance, we will ensure that teaching
assistants can become qualified teachers and healthcare assistants can become nurses
via a degree apprenticeship route, in addition to other routes.

We will equip people with the digital skills they need now, and in the future, by
introducing a right to lifelong learning in digital skills, just as we have done for literacy
and numeracy.

More people in work

Employment is at a record high and we will continue to strive for full employment. We
will continue to run the welfare system in accordance with our belief that work is the
best route out of poverty, that work should always pay, and that the system should be
fair both to the people in need of support and those who pay for it. We have no plans
for further radical welfare reform in this parliament and will continue the roll-out of
Universal Credit, to ensure that it always pays to be in work.

We will also work to help those groups who have in the past found it difficult to get
employment, by incentivising employers to take them on. So for businesses employing
former wards of the care system, someone with a disability, those with chronic mental
health problems, those who have committed a crime but who have repaid their debt to
society, and those who have been unemployed for over a year, we will offer a holiday on
their employers’ National Insurance Contributions for a full year. We will also provide
targeted support for young people between the ages of 18 and 24 so that everyone, no
matter what their start in life, is given the very best chance of getting into work.

A COUNTRY THAT COMES TOGETHER

Controlling immigration

Britain is an open economy and a welcoming society and we will always ensure that
our British businesses can recruit the brightest and best from around the world and
Britain’s world-class universities can attract international students. We also believe that
immigration should be controlled and reduced, because when immigration is too fast
and too high, it is difficult to build a cohesive society.

Thanks to Conservatives in government, there is now more control in the system. The
nature of the immigration we have — more skilled workers and university students,
less abuse and fewer unskilled migrants — better suits the national interest. But with
annual net migration standing at 273,000, immigration to Britain is still too high. It is
our objective to reduce immigration to sustainable levels, by which we mean annual net
migration in the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands we have seen
over the last two decades.

We will, therefore, continue to bear down on immigration from outside the European
Union. We will increase the earnings thresholds for people wishing to sponsor migrants
for family visas. We will toughen the visa requirements for students, to make sure that we
maintain high standards. We will expect students to leave the country at the end of their
course, unless they meet new, higher requirements that allow them to work in Britain
after their studies have concluded. Overseas students will remain in the immigration

 

3. THE WORLD’S GREAT MERITOCRACY

 

statistics — in line with international definitions — and within scope of the government’s
policy to reduce annual net migration.

Leaving the European Union means, for the first time in decades, that we will be able
to control immigration from the European Union too. We will therefore establish an
immigration policy that allows us to reduce and control the number of people who come
to Britain from the European Union, while still allowing us to attract the skilled workers
our economy needs.

Integrating divided communities

Britain is one of the world’s most successful multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-religious
societies. We are proud of our diversity, and the cultural and economic enrichment
it brings.

The enjoyment and pride we take in our diversity should not cause us to ignore the
fact that in too many parts of our country, we have communities that are divided, often
along racial or religious lines. To address this, we will bring forward a new integration
strategy, which will seek to help people in more isolated communities to engage with
the wider world, help women in particular into the workplace, and teach more people
to speak English. We will work with schools to make sure that those with intakes from
one predominant racial, cultural or religious background teach their students about
pluralistic, British values and help them to get to know people with different ways of life.

Defeating extremism

Our enjoyment of Britain’s diversity must not prevent us from confronting the menace of
extremism. Extremism, especially Islamist extremism, strips some British people, especially
women, of the freedoms they should enjoy, undermines the cohesion of our society and
can fuel violence. To defeat extremism, we need to learn from how civil society and the
state took on racism in the twentieth century. We will consider what new criminal offences
might need to be created, and what new aggravated offences might need to be established,
to defeat the extremists. We will support the public sector and civil society in identifying
extremists, countering their messages and promoting pluralistic, British values. And we
will establish a Commission for Countering Extremism to identify examples of extremism
and expose them, to support the public sector and civil society, and help the government
to identify policies to defeat extremism and promote pluralistic values.

CONFRONTING BURNING INJUSTICES

To make Britain the world’s Great Meritocracy, where your talent and hard work, not
who you are or where you come from, determine your life chances, we must look
beyond divisions in educational opportunity. We must tackle the burning injustices

 

a
a

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

that Theresa May identified on the steps of Downing Street last year: longstanding,
entrenched injustices that affect people of different ethnicities, genders and those with
disabilities and mental ill health.

The gender pay gap

We will take measures to close the gender pay gap. We will require companies with more
than 250 employees to publish more data on the pay gap between men and women. We
shall continue to work for parity in the number of public appointments going to women,
and we shall push for an increase in the number of women sitting on boards of companies.

We will take steps to improve take-up of shared parental leave and help companies
provide more flexible work environments that help mothers and fathers to share
parenting. We want to help those who have been caring for a child or children for a
number of years or supporting an elderly relative. For these people, returning to work
can be daunting: things have moved on and people worry that their skills have been
eroded. We will address this, providing parents and carers with the confidence to return
to work when and how they wish. So we will support companies to take on parents and
carers returning to work after long periods of absence and back similar schemes in the
public sector, including the country’s biggest employer, our NHS.

The race gap

Theresa May’s first act as prime minister was to order an unprecedented audit of racial
disparity across public services, to reveal the outcomes experienced by people of different
ethnicities. That audit reports in July and a Conservative government will not hesitate to
act on its findings, however uncomfortable they may be.

Alongside that assault on injustice, we will tackle those issues we already know about
head on. We will strengthen the enforcement of equalities law — so that private landlords
and businesses who deny people a service on the basis of ethnicity, religion or gender
are properly investigated and prosecuted. We will legislate to mandate changes in police
practices if stop and search’ does not become more targeted and ’stop to arrest’ ratios do
not improve. We will reduce the disproportionate use of force against Black, Asian and
ethnic minority people in prison, young offender institutions and secure mental health
units and we will legislate here too if progress is not made. We will launch a national
campaign to increase the number of Black, Asian and ethnic minority organ donors to
cut the long waiting times for patients from those groups and save more lives. We will
also ask large employers to publish information on the pay gap for people from different
ethnic backgrounds.

The mental health gap
It was Conservatives in government that gave parity of esteem to the treatment of mental
health in the National Health Service. We have backed this with a significant increase in

 

3. THE WORLD’S GREAT MERITOCRACY

 

funding: since 2010 we have increased spending on mental health each year to a record
£11.4 billion in 2016/17, with a further investment of £1 billion by 20/21, so that we can
deliver the mental health services people deserve. We will now build on this commitment.

First, we will address the need for better treatments across the whole spectrum of mental
health conditions. We will make the UK the leading research and technology economy in
the world for mental health, bringing together public, private and charitable investment.

Improving treatment services will not be sufficient, however. We will also reform
outdated laws to ensure that those with mental illness are treated fairly and employers
fulfil their responsibilities effectively.

The current Mental Health Act does not operate as it should: if you are put on a
community treatment order it is very difficult to be discharged; sectioning is too often
used to detain rather than treat; families’ information about their loved ones is severely
curtailed — parents can be the last to learn that their son or daughter has been sectioned.
So we will introduce the first new Mental Health Bill for thirty-five years, putting parity
of esteem at the heart of treatment.

We will transform how mental health is regarded in the workplace. We will amend health
and safety regulations so that employers provide appropriate first aid training and needs-
assessment for mental health, as they currently do for risks to physical health, and extend
Equalities Act protections against discrimination to mental health conditions that are
episodic and fluctuating. We will consider the findings of the Stevenson-Farmer Review into
workplace mental health support, working with employers to encourage new products and
incentives to improve the mental health and wellbeing support available to their employees.
And, as we did with Dementia Friends, we will train one million members of the public in
basic mental health awareness and first aid to break the stigma of mental illness.

The disability gap

We will build on the proud Conservative record in supporting those with disabilities,
including the landmark Disability Discrimination Act of 1995. We want to see attitudes
to disability shift as they have for race, gender and sexuality in recent years: it should be
completely unacceptable for people with disabilities to be treated negatively.

We will get 1 million more people with disabilities into employment over the next ten years.
We will harness the opportunities of flexible working and the digital economy to generate
jobs for those whose disabilities make traditional work difficult. We will give employers
the advice and support they need to hire and retain disabled people and those with health
conditions. We will continue to ensure a sustainable welfare system, with help targeted at
those who need it most. We will legislate to give unemployed disabled claimants or those
with a health condition personalised and tailored employment support.

 

a
g

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

We believe that where you live, shop, go out, travel or park your car should not be
determined by your disability. So we will review disabled people’s access and amend
regulations if necessary to improve disabled access to licensed premises, parking and
housing. We will work with providers of everyday essential services, like energy and
telecoms, to reduce the extra costs that disability can incur.

Preventing domestic violence

Conservatives in government have already acted to help victims of domestic violence to
seek refuge. We can and should go further. We need the police to investigate allegations
thoroughly and treat victims with the care they deserve. We need to bring to the justice
system greater guidance and clarity about the impact of domestic violence and abuse on
families. And we need to understand and respond to the devastating and lifelong impact
that domestic violence and abuse has on children, who carry the effects into adulthood.

A Conservative government will bring forward a Domestic Violence and Abuse Bill
in the next parliament to consolidate all civil and criminal prevention and protection
orders and provide for a new aggravated offence if behaviour is directed at a child. There
is currently no statutory definition of domestic violence and abuse. We will therefore
also legislate to enshrine a definition of domestic violence and abuse in law, providing
the legal underpinning for everything in our new act. This will enable us to work with
victim support groups, experts and agencies to determine whether the current statutory
definition is wide enough, to help survivors understand more easily if they have a basis
for a complaint, and to provide a more reliable basis for police forces to investigate and
the Crown Prosecution Service to prosecute.

We will create a domestic violence and abuse commissioner in law, to stand up for victims
and survivors, monitor the response to domestic violence and abuse and to hold the police
and the criminal justice system to account. And we will take action to support victims
of domestic violence to leave abusive partners, reviewing the funding for refuges and
ensuring that victims who have lifetime tenancies and flee violence are able to secure a
new lifetime tenancy automatically.

Reducing homelessness

Finally, we will continue to combat homelessness and rough sleeping including through
full implementation of the Homelessness Reduction Act. Our aim will be to halve rough
sleeping over the course of the parliament and eliminate it altogether by 2027. To achieve
this we will set up a new homelessness reduction taskforce that will focus on prevention
and affordable housing, and we will pilot a Housing First approach to tackle rough sleeping.

 

3. THE WORLD’S GREAT MERITOCRACY

 

CUTTING THE COST OF LIVING

Breaking down long-standing social divisions in our society means tackling everyday
economic pressures that hold back ordinary, working families. Government can help
with the cost of living by keeping tax as low as possible. As we set out in chapter one we
want to reduce taxes on British businesses and working families. But government can also
help by making consumer markets work more fairly, and in doing so reducing the cost of the
essentials that families have no choice but to buy. These costs make up a much larger share of
working class household budgets than those of better-off households.

Fair markets for consumers

Tackling living costs must mean making consumer markets work fairly. Markets should
work for consumers, as well as producers — with competition keeping prices low and
encouraging new product development. Poor information, complex pricing and
exploitative behaviour prevents markets operating efficiently for the benefit of all.

As Conservatives, we believe in markets as the best means to bring about prosperity and
innovation, but we should act firmly and fast when a market works against the interests
of consumers. Since 2010, we have capped the cost of credit for expensive payday lenders
and will shortly ban letting agent fees. We will now go further to reform markets in the
interests of consumers and reduce the cost of living.

A Conservative government will strengthen the hand of regulators. We will strengthen the
powers of consumer enforcement bodies to order fines against companies breaking consumer
law and deliver redress for wronged parties. We will explore how to give consumers a voice in
the regulation of business. We will put the interest of vulnerable consumers first, including
considering a duty on regulators to weigh up their needs. We will investigate how switching
sites can better serve competition, including by providing shoppers with information about
quality of service and complaints. We will strengthen the hand of online consumers. We will
act to make terms and conditions clearer, and end the abusive use of subscription services,
including by making it clearer when free trials come to an end.

We will also act in specific markets. A Conservative government will reform and
modernise the home-buying process so it is more efficient and less costly. We will
crack down on unfair practices in leasehold, such as escalating ground rents. We will
also improve protections for those who rent, including by looking at how we increase
security for good tenants and encouraging landlords to offer longer tenancies as
standard. We will make billing for telecoms customers fairer and easier to understand,
including making clear when a mobile customer has paid off the price of their
handset. We will consider a ban on companies cold calling people encouraging them
to make false personal injury claims. We will take steps to tackle rogue private parking
operators. We will reduce insurance costs for ordinary motorists by cracking down on

 

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

exaggerated and fraudulent whiplash claims. We will review rail ticketing, removing
complexity and perverse pricing, and introduce a passenger ombudsman to stand up
for the interests of rail users suffering a poor deal. We will work with train companies
and their employees to agree minimum service levels during periods of industrial
dispute — and if we cannot find a voluntary agreement, we will legislate to make this
mandatory.

Fair energy markets

We will pay immediate attention to the retail energy market. Customers trust established
brands and mistakenly assume their loyalty is rewarded. Energy suppliers have long
operated a two-tier market, where those constantly checking for the best deal can do well
but others are punished for inactivity with higher prices. Those hit worst are households
with lower incomes, people with lower qualifications, people who rent their home and
the elderly. A Conservative government will act in their interests.

First, we will ensure that smart meters will be offered to every household and business by
the end of 2020, giving people control over their energy bills that they have not had before.

We will go further. We will introduce a safeguard tariff cap that will extend the price protection
currently in place for some vulnerable customers to more customers on the poorest value
tariffs. We will maintain the competitive element of the retail energy market by supporting
initiatives to make the switching process easier and more reliable, but the safeguard tariff cap
will protect customers who do not switch against abusive price increases.

Alongside giving individuals greater control over their energy bills and protecting
customers from unfair bills, we will help them to save energy. An energy efficient home
is a more affordable and healthy home. We will improve the energy efficiency of existing
homes, especially for the least well off, by committing to upgrading all fuel poor homes
to EPC Band C by 2030. We will also review requirements on new homes.

Fair debt

For some people, the cost of living can become too great. Problem debt can be hard to
escape and can compound family breakdown, worklessness, stress and mental health
issues. We will adopt a “Breathing Space” scheme, with the right safeguards to prevent
abuse, so that someone in serious problem debt may apply for legal protection from
further interest, charges and enforcement action for a period of up to six weeks. Where
appropriate, they will be offered a statutory repayment plan to help them pay back
their debts in a manageable way. This will give eligible debtors time to seek advice and
assistance to apply for a sustainable solution to their debt.

Theresa May’s Conservatives will deliver

Sound public finances, built on fiscal
credibility and a balanced budget by the
middle of the next decade.

Guaranteed annual increases in the state
pension through a new Double Lock to be
introduced in 2020.

Dignity and protection in old age through the
right long-term solution for elderly care.

Exceptional healthcare, whenever, wherever,
delivered by an NHS with the money,
buildings and people it needs.

Homes for all, including a new generation of
fixed-term council housing linked to anew
Right to Buy.

High-quality childcare for working families,
supported by thousands of new nursery
places a year.

4. A RESTORED CONTRACT BETWEEN THE GENERATIONS

 

o grandparent wants to see their grandchildren worse off than they

were, yet that is precisely the fear many older people now have. No son
or daughter wants to see their parents poorly cared for or their hard-earned
assets whittled away, yet that is the reality for too many old people in care. We
must admit that the solidarity that binds generations is under strain in our
country.

We will restore the contract between the generations, providing older people with
security against ill health while ensuring we maintain the promise of opportunity
and prosperity for younger generations. That contract includes our National
Health Service, which is founded on the principle that those who have should
help those who do not. It is a system of solidarity to which we all contribute, not
just to help us and our families when we are in need but to protect others in our
community when they need help too. This not just expediency: we do it because
the support we give each other ties us together.

This solidarity is a Conservative principle, growing out of family, community and
nation — all things that Conservatives believe in and work to conserve. At times,
solidarity will require great generosity from one group to another — of younger
working people to pay for the dignified old age of retired people, and of older
people balancing what they receive with the needs of the younger generation.

Our United Kingdom can seize enormous opportunities but only if we make
decisions for the long term. We trust the people of this country, who know that
we face difficult choices — and demand the respect of politicians who should be
honest about how those choices can be resolved.

 

DEALING WITH THE DEFICIT

The greatest impact a government can have on future generations is the amount it
chooses to borrow to pay for current spending. Borrowing always means spending
money you do not have; but government borrowing differs because the repayment falls
to others — those who come later, including people not yet born. Conservatives believe
in balancing the books and paying down debts — because it is wrong to pass to future
generations a bill you cannot or will not pay yourself.

The next Conservative government will continue the difficult but necessary work of
restoring our public finances while still ensuring that we are investing for the future. As

 

63

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

we set out in chapter one, we will continue to aim for a balanced budget by the middle of
the next decade, in line with the fiscal rules announced by the chancellor in his autumn
statement last year.

AN AGEING SOCIETY

People are living longer. This is a good thing, but we should notignore the consequences.
As our society ages, the costs of caring for older generations — pensions, pensioner
benefits, health and social care — rise; and these are borne by working people through
their taxes. As the relative number of younger people is falling, those costs increase, not
just in total, but also for individuals. So if we are to give older people the dignity we owe
them and younger people the opportunities they deserve, we face difficult decisions.

Guaranteed annual increases in the state pension

A decade ago, pensions were in crisis and poverty blighted the retirement of many older
people. It was wrong and it has been a Conservative government that has helped to put it
right. By introducing the Pensions Triple Lock and the new State Pension, we have lifted the
incomes of millions of older people, reducing pensioner poverty to historically low levels.
The Triple Lock has worked: it is now time to set pensions on an even course. So we will keep
our promise to maintain the Triple Lock until 2020, and when it expires we will introduce a
new Double Lock, meaning that pensions will rise in line with the earnings that pay for them,
or in line with inflation — whichever is highest. We will also ensure that the state pension age
reflects increases in life expectancy, while protecting each generation fairly.

The state pension is the basic building block for income in retirement. In addition
to safeguarding the rising state pension, we will continue to support the successful
expansion of auto-enrolled pensions, enabling more people to increase their retirement
income with help from their employers and government; we will continue to extend
auto-enrolment to small employers and make it available to the self-employed. We
will promote long-term savings and pensions products, including the Lifetime ISA, to
encourage and incentivise more people to make provision for long-term needs, including
a house purchase and retirement.

A long-term plan for elderly care

Our system of care for the elderly is not working for the hundreds of thousands currently
not getting the dignified and careful attention they deserve, nor for the people and
organisations providing that care, nor is it sustainable for today’s younger people who
will potentially one day face care costs themselves. It is not fair that the quality of care
you receive and how much you pay for it depends in large part on where you live and
whether you own your own home.

 

64

4. A RESTORED CONTRACT BETWEEN THE GENERATIONS

 

Where others have failed to lead, we will act. We have already taken immediate action,
putting £2 billion into the social care system and allowing councils to raise more money
for care themselves from Council Tax. We are now proposing medium and long-term
solutions to put elderly care in our country on a strong and stable footing.

Under the current system, care costs deplete an individual's assets, including in some
cases the family home, down to £23,250 or even less. These costs can be catastrophic
for those with modest or medium wealth. One purpose of long-term saving is to cover
needs in old age; those who can should rightly contribute to their care from savings
and accumulated wealth, rather than expecting current and future taxpayers to carry
the cost on their behalf. Moreover, many older people have built considerable property
assets due to rising property prices. Reconciling these competing pressures fairly and in
a sustainable way has challenged many governments of the past. We intend to tackle this
with three connected measures.

First, we will align the future basis for means-testing for domiciliary care with that for
residential care, so that people are looked after in the place that is best for them. This will
mean that the value of the family home will be taken into account along with other assets
and income, whether care is provided at home, or in a residential or nursing care home.

Second, to ensure this is fair, we will introduce a single capital floor, set at £100,000,
more than four times the current means test threshold. This will ensure that, no matter
how large the cost of care turns out to be, people will always retain at least £100,000 of
their savings and assets, including value in the family home.

Third, we will extend the current freedom to defer payments for residential care to those
receiving care at home, so no-one will have to sell their home in their lifetime to pay for care.

We believe this powerful combination maximises protection for pensioner households
with modest assets, often invested in the family home, while remaining affordable
for taxpayers. We consider it more equitable, within and across the generations, than
the proposals following the Dilnot Report, which mostly benefited a small number of
wealthier people.

An efficient elderly care system which provides dignity is not merely a function of money.
So our forthcoming green paper will also address system-wide issues to improve the quality
of care and reduce variation in practice. This will ensure the care system works better with
the NHS to reduce unnecessary and unhealthy hospital stays and delayed transfers of care,
and provide better quality assurance within the care sector. We will reduce loneliness and
promote technological solutions to prolong independent living, and invest in dementia
research. As the majority of care is informally provided, mainly by families, we will give
workers a new statutory entitlement to carer’s leave, as enjoyed in other countries.

 

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

Creating a sustainable elderly care system means making decisions about how the rising
budget devoted to pensioners is spent, so we will target help where it is needed most.
So we will look at Winter Fuel Payments, the largest benefit paid to pensioners, in this
context. The benefit is paid regardless of need, giving money to wealthier pensioners
when working people on lower incomes do not get similar support. So we will means-
test Winter Fuel Payments, focusing assistance on the least well-off pensioners, who are
most at risk of fuel poverty. The money released will be transferred directly to health and
social care, helping to provide dignity and care to the most vulnerable pensioners and
reassurance to their families. We will maintain all other pensioner benefits, including free
bus passes, eye tests, prescriptions and TV licences, for the duration of this parliament.

OUR NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE

Our National Health Service is the essence of solidarity in our United Kingdom - our
commitment to each other, between young and old, those who have and those who
do not, and the healthy and the sick.

The Conservative Party believes in the founding principles of the NHS. First, that the
service should meet the needs of everyone, no matter who they are or where they live.
Second, that care should be based on clinical need, not the ability to pay. Third, that
care should be free at the point of use. As the NHS enters its eighth decade, the next
Conservative government will hold fast to these principles by providing the NHS with
the resources it needs and holding it accountable for delivering exceptional care to
patients wherever and whenever they need it.

The money and people the NHS needs

In five ways, the next Conservative government will give the NHS the resources it needs.

First, we will increase NHS spending by a minimum of £8 billion in real terms over the
next five years, delivering an increase in real funding per head of the population for
every year of the parliament.

Second, we will ensure that the NHS and social care system have the nurses, midwives,
doctors, carers and other health professionals that it needs. We will make it a priority
in our negotiations with the European Union that the 140,000 staff from EU countries
can carry on making their vital contribution to our health and care system. However, we
cannot continue to rely on bringing in clinical staff instead of training sufficient numbers
ourselves. Last year we announced an increase in the number of students in medical
training of 1,500 a year; we will continue this investment, doing something the NHS has
never done before, and train the doctors our hospitals and surgeries need.

 

66

4. A RESTORED CONTRACT BETWEEN THE GENERATIONS

 

Third, we will ensure that the NHS has the buildings and technology it needs to deliver
care properly and efficiently. Since its inception, the NHS has been forced to use too
many inadequate and antiquated facilities, which are even more unsuitable today. We
will put this right and enable more care to be delivered closer to home, by building and
upgrading primary care facilities, mental health clinics and hospitals in every part of
England. Over the course of the next parliament, this will amount to the most ambitious
programme of investment in buildings and technology the NHS has ever seen.

Fourth, whilst the NHS will always treat people in an emergency, no matter where they
are from, we will recover the cost of medical treatment from people not resident in the
UK. We will ensure that new NHS numbers are not issued to patients until their eligibility
has been verified. And we will increase the Immigration Health Surcharge, to £600 for
migrant workers and £450 for international students, to cover their use of the NHS. This
remains competitive compared to the costs of health insurance paid by UK nationals
working or studying overseas.

Fifth, we will implement the recommendations of the Accelerated Access Review to make
sure that patients get new drugs and treatments faster while the NHS gets best value for
money and remains at the forefront of innovation.

Holding NHS leaders to account

It is NHS England that determines how best to organise and deliver care in England, set
out in its own plan to create amodern NHS - the Five Year Forward View. We supportit. We
will also back the implementation of the plan at a local level, through the Sustainability
and Transformation Plans, providing they are clinically led and locally supported.

We will hold NHS England’s leaders to account for delivering their plan to improve
patient care. If the current legislative landscape is either slowing implementation or
preventing clear national or local accountability, we will consult and make the necessary
legislative changes. This includes the NHS’s own internal market, which can fail to act in
the interests of patients and creates costly bureaucracy. So we will review the operation
of the internal market and, in time for the start of the 2018 financial year, we will make
non-legislative changes to remove barriers to the integration of care.

We expect GPs to come together to provide greater access, more innovative services,
share data and offer better facilities, while ensuring care remains personal — particularly
for older and more vulnerable people — with named GPs accountable for individual
patients. We will support GPs to deliver innovative services that better meet patients’
needs, including phone and on-line consultations and the use of technology to triage
people better so they see the right clinician more quickly. We will ensure appropriate
funding for GPs to meet rising costs of indemnity in the short term while working with
the profession to introduce a sustainable long-term solution.

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

We will introduce a new GP contract to help develop wider primary care services. We
will reform the contract for hospital consultants to reflect the changed nature of hospital
care over the past twenty years. We shall support more integrated working, including
ensuring community pharmacies can play a stronger role to keep people healthy outside
hospital within the wider health system. We will support NHS dentistry to improve
coverage and reform contracts so that we pay for better outcomes, particularly for
deprived children. And we will legislate to reform and rationalise the current outdated
system of professional regulation of healthcare professions, based on the advice of
professional regulators, and ensure there is effective registration and regulation of those
performing cosmetic interventions.

We will also help the million and more NHS clinicians and support staff develop the skills
they need and the NHS requires in the decades ahead. We will encourage the development
of new roles and create a diverse set of potential career paths for the NHS workforce. And
we will reform medical education, including helping universities and local health systems
work closer together to develop the roles and skills needed to serve patients.

We want the NHS to become a better employer. We will strengthen the entitlement to
flexible working to help those with caring responsibilities for young children or older
relatives. We will introduce new services for employees to give them the support they
need, including quicker access to mental health and musculoskeletal services. We will
act to reduce bullying rates in the NHS, which are far too high. We will take vigorous and
immediate action against those who abuse or attack the people who work for and make
our NHS.

Exceptional standards of care, wherever, whenever

Outcomes in the NHS for most major conditions are considerably better than three, five
or ten years ago. However, the founding intention for the NHS was to provide good levels
of care to everyone, wherever they live. This has not yet been achieved: there remain
significant variations in outcomes and quality across services and across the country. We
will act to put this right.

To help the NHS provide exceptional care in all parts of England, we will make clinical
outcomes more transparent so that clinicians and frontline staff can learn more easily
from the best units and practices, and where there is clear evidence of poor patient
outcomes, we will take rapid corrective action. We will ensure patients have the
information they need to understand local services and hold them to account.

We will empower patients, giving them a greater role in their own treatment and use
technology to put care at their convenience. In addition to the digital tools patients
already have, we will give patients, via digital means or over the phone, the ability to
book appointments, contact the 111 service, order repeat prescriptions, and access and

 

68

4. A RESTORED CONTRACT BETWEEN THE GENERATIONS

 

update aspects of their care records, as well as control how their personal data is used.
We will continue to expand the number of NHS approved apps that can help monitor
care and provide support for physical and mental health conditions. We will pilot the
live publication of waiting times data for A&Es and other urgent care services. We will
further expand the use of personal budgets. We will also continue to take action to reduce
obesity and support our National Diabetes Prevention Programme.

Our ambition is also to provide exceptional care to patients whenever they need it. That
is why we want England to be the first nation in the world to provide a truly seven-day
healthcare service. That ambition starts with primary care. Already 17 million people
can get routine weekend or evening appointments at either their own GP surgery or one
nearby, and this will expand to the whole population by 2019.

In hospitals, we will make sure patients receive proper consultant supervision every day
of the week with weekend access to the key diagnostic tests needed to support urgent
care. We will also ensure hospitals can discharge emergency admissions at a similar rate
at weekends as on weekdays, so that when someone is medically fit to leave hospital they
can, whichever day of the week it is.

We will retain the 95 per cent A&E target and the 18-week elective care standard so that
those needing care receive it in a timely fashion.

We will continue to help the NHS on its journey to being the safest healthcare system
in the world. We will extend the scope of the CQC to cover the health-related services
commissioned by local authorities. We will legislate for an independent healthcare safety
investigations body in the NHS. We will require the NHS to continue to reduce infant and
maternal deaths, which remain too high.

Our commitment to consistent high quality care for everyone applies to all conditions.
We will set new standards in some priority areas and also improve our response to
historically underfunded and poorly understood disease groups.

In cancer services, we will deliver the new promise to give patients a definitive diagnosis
within 28 days by 2020, while expanded screening and a major radiotherapy equipment
upgrade will help ensure many more people survive cancer.

We will continue to rectify the injustice suffered by those with mental health problems,
by ensuring that they get the care and support they deserve. So we will make sure there is
more support in every part of the country by recruiting up to 10,000 more mental health
professionals. We shall require all our medical staff to have a deeper understanding of
mental health and all trainees will get a chance to experience working in mental health
disciplines; we shall ensure medical exams better reflect the importance of this area. And

 

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

we will improve the co-ordination of mental health services with other local services,
including police forces and drug and alcohol rehabilitation services.

We have a specific task to improve standards of care for those with learning disabilities
and autism. We will work to reduce stigma and discrimination and implement in full the
Transforming Care Programme.

We will improve the care we give people at the end of life. We will fulfil the commitment we
made that every person should receive attentive, high quality, compassionate care, so that
their pain is eased, their spiritual needs met and their wishes for their closing weeks, days
and hours respected. We will ensure all families who lose a baby are given the bereavement
support they need, including a new entitlement to child bereavement leave.

HOMES FOR ALL

We have not built enough homes in this country for generations, and buying or
renting a home has become increasingly unaffordable. If we do not put this right, we
will be unable to extend the promise of a decent home, let alone home ownership, to the
millions who deserve it.

We will fix the dysfunctional housing market so that housing is more affordable and
people have the security they need to plan for the future. The key to this is to build
enough homes to meet demand. That will slow the rise in housing costs so more ordinary,
working families can afford to buy a home and bring the cost of renting down. And it will
ensure that more private capital is invested in more productive investment, helping the
economy to grow faster and more securely in future years.

We will meet our 2015 commitment to deliver a million homes by the end of 2020 and we
will deliver half a million more by the end of 2022. We will deliver the reforms proposed
in our Housing White Paper to free up more land for new homes in the right places, speed
up build-out by encouraging modern methods of construction and give councils powers
to intervene where developers do not act on their planning permissions; and we will
diversify who builds homes in this country.

More homes will not mean poor quality homes. For too long, careless developers, high
land costs and poor planning have conspired to produce housing developments that do
not enhance the lives of those living there. We have not provided the infrastructure,
parks, quality of space and design that turns housing into community and makes
communities prosperous and sustainable. The result is felt by many ordinary, working
families. Too often, those renting or buying a home on a modest income have to tolerate

 

4. A RESTORED CONTRACT BETWEEN THE GENERATIONS

 

substandard developments -some only a few years old -and are denied a decent place in
which to live, where they can put down roots and raise children. For a country boasting
the finest architects and planners in the world, this is unacceptable.

We will build better houses, to match the quality of those we have inherited from
previous generations. That means supporting high-quality, high-density housing like
mansion blocks, mews houses and terraced streets. It means maintaining the existing
strong protections on designated land like the Green Belt, National Parks and Areas
of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It means not just concentrating development in the
south-east but rebalancing housing growth across the country, in line with our modern
industrial strategy. It means government building 160,000 houses on its own land. It
means supporting specialist housing where it is needed, like multigenerational homes
and housing for older people, including by helping housing associations increase their
specialist housing stock.

We will never achieve the numbers of new houses we require without the active
participation of social and municipal housing providers. This must not be done at the
expense of high standards, however: councils have been amongst the worst offenders in
failing to build sustainable, integrated communities. In some instances, they have built
for political gain rather than for social purpose. So we will help councils to build, but only
those councils who will build high-quality, sustainable and integrated communities.
We will enter into new Council Housing Deals with ambitious, pro-development, local
authorities to help them build more social housing. We will work with them to improve
their capability and capacity to develop more good homes, as well as providing them
with significant low-cost capital funding. In doing so, we will build new fixed-term social
houses, which will be sold privately after ten to fifteen years with an automatic Right
to Buy for tenants, the proceeds of which will be recycled into further homes. We will
reform Compulsory Purchase Orders to make them easier and less expensive for councils
to use and to make it easier to determine the true market value of sites.

We will also give greater flexibility to housing associations to increase their housing stock,
building on their considerable track record in recent years. And we will work with private
and public sector house builders to capture the increase in land value created when they
build to reinvest in local infrastructure, essential services and further housing, making it
both easier and more certain that public sector landowners, and communities themselves,
benefit from the increase in land value from urban regeneration and development. And we
will continue our £2.5 billion flood defence programme that will put in place protection for
300,000 existing homes by 2021.

These ambitious policies will mean more and better homes, welcomed by existing
communities because they add, rather than subtract, from what is already there. This
is the sustainable development we need to see happen in every village, town and city

 

71

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

across our country. These policies will take time, and meanwhile we will continue to
support those struggling to buy or rent a home, including those living in a home owned
by a housing association.

CHILDREN AND FAMILIES

Britain should be the best country in the world for children. We want to reduce levels
of child poverty, and have high ambitions for the quality of childcare, children’s health
and support for vulnerable children for whom the state acts as a parent.

High-quality childcare

We know high-quality childcare is important not just to working parents but even more
so to a child’s development and happiness. That is why a Conservative government
will introduce, this year, thirty hours of free childcare for three and four-year-olds for
working parents who find it difficult to manage the costs of childcare. We will go further.
The next Conservative government will assess what more is needed, including looking
at the best ways that childcare is provided elsewhere in Europe and the world. As a sign
of our commitment, we will immediately institute a capital fund to help primary schools
develop nurseries where they currently do not have the facilities to provide one. We will
introduce a presumption that all new primary schools should include a nursery. And
we will continue to support maintained nurseries and allow them to take on academy
freedoms, supporting them to grow independently or as part of a multi-academy trust.

Children’s and young people’s health

We believe government has a role to play in helping young people get the best possible
start in life. We are seeing progress: smoking rates are now lower than France or Germany,
drinking rates have fallen below the European average and teenage pregnancies are
at record lows. We will continue to take action to reduce childhood obesity. We will
promote efforts to reduce unhealthy ingredients and provide clearer food information for
consumers, as our decision to leave the European Union will give us greater flexibility over
the presentation of information on packaged food. We shall continue to support school
sport, delivering on our commitment to double support for sports in primary schools.

We understand the massively increased pressures on young people’s mental health. We
will take focused action to provide the support needed by children and young people. Half
of all mental health conditions become established in people before the age of fourteen.
So we will ensure better access to care for children and young people. A Conservative
government will publish a green paper on young people’s mental health before the end of
this year. We will introduce mental health first aid training for teachers in every primary
and secondary school by the end of the parliament and ensure that every school has a

 

4. A RESTORED CONTRACT BETWEEN THE GENERATIONS

 

single point of contact with mental health services. Every child will learn about mental
wellbeing and the mental health risks of internet harms in the curriculum. And we
will reform Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services so that children with serious
conditions are seen within an appropriate timeframe and no child has to leave their local
area and their family to receive normal treatment.

Protecting vulnerable children and families

We have made significant progress in helping vulnerable children and families over
the past seven years. Our investments in the social work profession and in successful,
innovative programmes have given tens of thousands of vulnerable families the co-
ordinated support they need.

Placing a child under the oversight of social services and taking a child into care are
amongst the most serious duties the state may discharge. We will demand all local
authorities be commissioners of the highest-quality family support and child protection
services, removing these responsibilities from the weakest councils and placing them
in trust. We will ensure that councils provide consistency of care and cannot relocate
vulnerable children far from their home when it is not in their best interests to do so. We
will review support for Children in Need to understand why their outcomes are so poor
and what more support they might require, in and out of school.

Finally, we shall explore ways to improve the family justice system. The family courts
need to do more to support families, valuing the roles of mothers and fathers, while
ensuring parents face up to their responsibilities.

5. PROSPERITY AND SECURITY IN A DIGITAL AGE

 

he opportunities and threats arising from the advance of digital

technology pose significant practical and philosophical challenges
to people, communities and governments around the world. These new
technologies provide us with new and faster ways to communicate, learn, travel,
have fun and do business. They accelerate the pace of change — ushering in
new norms in the space of years rather than decades; challenging our laws and
regulations to keep pace.

The UK has always been at the forefront of such changes, from the earliest days of
computing to the development of the World Wide Web. Today, we continue that
tradition with our world-leading digital economy, boasting particular expertise
in artificial intelligence, cyber security, gaming, FinTech, GovTech, and virtual
reality. We are optimistic about the opportunities on offer in the digital age, but
we understand these opportunities come with new challenges and threats — to
our security, privacy, emotional wellbeing, mental health and the safety of our
children. A Conservative government will respond to these challenges, to assure
the British people of security and fairness in the new digital age, and to strengthen
the UK’s position as one of the world’s leading digital economies.

 

A DIGITAL CHARTER

For hundreds of years, the United Kingdom has determined the rules and formed
the environment where new ideas and new technologies prosper — from financial
markets to the steam train to human embryology and the code of life itself. Our
wealth and security as a nation is founded on our ability to shape the future not just for
ourselves but for the world. Now we must do it again, to create the rules-based framework
in which the new technologies can create prosperity and growth.

A Conservative government will develop a digital charter, working with industry and
charities to establish a new framework that balances freedom with protection for users,
and offers opportunities alongside obligations for businesses and platforms. This charter
has two fundamental aims: that we will make Britain the best place to start and run a
digital business; and that we will make Britain the safest place in the world to be online.

The best place for digital business

Britain’s future prosperity will be built on our technical capability and creative flair.
Through our modern industrial strategy and digital strategy, we will help digital
companies at every stage of their growth. We will help innovators and startups, by

 

N
3

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

encouraging early stage investment and considering further incentives under our world-
leading Enterprise Investment Scheme and Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme. We will
help digital businesses to scale up and grow, with an ambition for many more to list here
in the UK, and open new offices of the British Business Bank in Birmingham, Bristol,
Cambridge, Edinburgh, Manchester and Newport, specialising in the local sector. As we
set out in chapter one, we will ensure digital businesses have access to the best talent
from overseas to compete with anywhere in the world. This will be complemented by
at least one new institute of technology in the UK, dedicated to world-leading digital
skills and developed and run in partnership with the tech industry. When we leave the
European Union, we will fund the British Business Bank with the repatriated funds from
the European Investment Fund.

We will ensure there is a sustainable business model for high-quality media online, to
create a level playing field for our media and creative industries. We will help provide the
skills and digital infrastructure that creative companies need and will seek to build upon
the favourable tax arrangements that have helped them, including the highly successful
creative industries tax credits scheme. We will ensure there is a robust system for
protection of intellectual property when the UK has left the EU, with strong protections
against infringement.

We will make doing business online easier for companies and consumers. We will give
businesses the right to insist on a digital signature and the right to digital cancellation of
contracts. We will oblige all digital companies to provide digital receipts, clearer terms
and conditions when selling goods and services online and support new digital proofs
of identification. We will give consumers the same protections in online markets as they
have on the high street. For broadband customers, we will make broadband switching
easier and pricing more transparent.

We will ensure that consumers and businesses have access to the digital infrastructure
they need to succeed. By the end of this year, 19 out of 20 premises will have access to
superfast broadband and our Universal Service Obligation will ensure that by 2020 every
home and every business in Britain has access to high speed broadband. We will work to
provide gigaspeed connectivity to as many businesses and homes as possible. We will
introduce a full fibre connection voucher for companies across the country by 2018 and
by 2022 we will have major fibre spines in over a hundred towns and cities, with ten
million premises connected to full fibre and a clear path to national coverage over the
next decade.

We have similar ambitions for mobile phone coverage. By 2022 we will extend mobile
coverage further to 95 per cent geographic coverage of the UK. By the same date, all
major roads and main line trains will enjoy full and uninterrupted mobile phone signal,
alongside guaranteed WiFi internet service on all such trains. We will continue to release

 

78

5. PROSPERITY AND SECURITY IN A DIGITAL AGE

 

more spectrum from public sector use to allow greater private sector access and begin
the roll-out of a new 5G network, providing gigaspeed connection to your smart phone.
We plan to have the majority of the population covered by a 5G signal by 2027.

The safest place to be online

In harnessing the digital revolution, we must take steps to protect the vulnerable and
give people confidence to use the internet without fear of abuse, criminality or exposure
to horrific content. Our starting point is that online rules should reflect those that govern
our lives offline. It should be as unacceptable to bully online as it is in the playground,
as difficult to groom a young child on the internet as it is in a community, as hard for
children to access violent and degrading pornography online as it is in the high street,
and as difficult to commit a crime digitally as it is physically.

Where technology can find a solution, we will pursue it. We will work with industry to
introduce new protections for minors, from images of pornography, violence, and other
age-inappropriate content not just on social media but in app stores and content sites as
well. We will put a responsibility on industry not to direct users — even unintentionally
— to hate speech, pornography, or other sources of harm. We will make clear the
responsibility of platforms to enable the reporting of inappropriate, bullying, harmful or
illegal content, with take-down on a comply-or-explain basis.

We will continue to push the internet companies to deliver on their commitments to
develop technical tools to identify and remove terrorist propaganda, to help smaller
companies build their capabilities and to provide support for civil society organisations
to promote alternative and counter-narratives. In addition, we do not believe that there
should be a safe space for terrorists to be able to communicate online and will work to
prevent them from having this capability.

We will educate today’s young people in the harms of the internet and how best to combat
them, introducing comprehensive Relationships and Sex Education in all primary and
secondary schools to ensure that children learn about the risks of the internet, including
cyberbullying and online grooming.

Where we believe people need more protections to keep them safe, we will act to protect
them. We will give people new rights to ensure they are in control of their own data,
including the ability to require major social media platforms to delete information
held about them at the age of 18, the ability to access and export personal data, and an
expectation that personal data held should be stored in a secure way. To create a sound
ethical framework for how data is used, we will institute an expert Data Use and Ethics
Commission to advise regulators and parliament on the nature of data use and how best
to prevent its abuse. The Commission will help us to develop the principles and rules
that will give people confidence that their data is being handled properly. Alongside

 

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

this commission, we will bring forward a new data protection law, fit for our new data
age, to ensure the very best standards for the safe, flexible and dynamic use of data and
enshrining our global leadership in the ethical and proportionate regulation of data. We
will put the National Data Guardian for Health and Social Care on a statutory footing to
ensure data security standards are properly enforced.

We will continue with our £1.9 billion investment in cyber security and build on the
successful establishment of the National Cyber Security Centre through our world-
leading cyber security strategy. We will make sure that our public services, businesses,
charities and individual users are protected from cyber risks. We will further strengthen
cyber security standards for government and public services, requiring all public services
to follow the most up to date cyber security techniques appropriate.

A free media

At a time when the internet is changing the way people obtain their news, we also
need to take steps to protect the reliability and objectivity of information that is
essential to our democracy and a free and independent press. We will ensure content
creators are appropriately rewarded for the content they make available online. We
will be consistent in our approach to regulation of online and offline media. Given the
comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and given the lengthy
investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing,
we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture,
practices and ethics of the press. We will repeal Section 40 of the Crime and Courts
Act 2014, which, if enacted, would force media organisations to become members of a
flawed regulatory system or risk having to pay the legal costs of both sides in libel and
privacy cases, even if they win.

DIGITAL GOVERNMENT AND
PUBLIC SERVICES

We believe government should not only be exceptional in dealing digitally with the
people it serves but should also at the forefront of using digital technology in all its
systems so that it can deliver better public services.

We will therefore create a new presumption of digital government services by default
and an expectation that all government services are fully accessible online, with
assisted digital support available for all public sector websites. We will publish far more
information about public services online, including relevant information about local
issues and public transport so that every person can find out up to date information
about roadworks, planning applications and bus routes online, without the hassle and

 

80

5. PROSPERITY AND SECURITY IN A DIGITAL AGE

 

delay that currently exists. We will create new ’schools maps’ to help parents choose the
school that is right for their child, giving them key information about quality of teaching,
attainment and the curriculum of local schools as they choose their school preferences
to support their decisions.

We will publish operational performance data of all public-facing services for open
comparison as amatter of course—helping the publicto holdtheir local services to account,
or choose other better services if they prefer. In doing so, central and local government
will be required to release information regularly and in an open format, and data will be
aggregated and anonymised where it is important to do so. We will incubate more digital
services within government and introduce digital transformation fellowships, so that
hundreds of leaders from the world of tech can come into government to help deliver
better public services. We will continue the drive for open data, maintaining our position
as the world leader.

If we are to make full use of this opportunity, we must use common platforms across
government and the wider public sector. That must start with the way we identify
ourselves online, so that people have one single, common and safe way of verifying
themselves to all parts of government. That is why we shall roll out Verify, so that
people can identify themselves on all government online services by 2020, using their
own secure data that is not held by government. We will also make this platform more
widely available, so that people can safely verify their identify to access non-government
services such as banking. We will set out a strategy to rationalise the use of personal
data within government, reducing data duplication across all systems, so that we
automatically comply with the ’Once-Only’ principle in central government services by
2022 and wider public services by 2025.

We also want to use digital innovation to help tackle the great challenge of an ageing
population, in conjunction with our social care reforms set out in chapter four. We will
support new providers seeking to use digital technology to monitor long-term conditions
better, deploy carers to patients or support better domiciliary care away from hospitals.

Digital infrastructure

Digital technology will also transform the management of our national infrastructure.
We are leading the world in preparing for autonomous vehicles and will press ahead with
our plans to use digital technology to improve our railways, so that our roads and tracks
can carry more people, faster, more safely and more efficiently. Smart grids will make
the most efficient use of our electricity infrastructure and electric vehicles, and we will
use technology to manage our airspace better to reduce noise pollution and improve
capacity. We will step up our programme of support for businesses developing these new
technologies, creating a better environment for them to be tested in the UK.

 

81

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

 

Digital land

And we will use digital technology to release massive value from our land that currently
is simply not realised, introducing greater specialisation in the property development
industry and far greater transparency for buyers. To make this happen, we will combine
the relevant parts of HM Land Registry, Ordnance Survey, the Valuation Office Agency,
the Hydrographic Office and Geological Survey to create a comprehensive geospatial
data body within government, the largest repository of open land data in the world. This
new body will set the standards to digitise the planning process and help create the most
comprehensive digital map of Britain to date. In doing so, it will support a vibrant and
innovative digital economy, ranging from innovative tools to help people and developers
build to virtual mapping of Britain for use in video games and virtual reality.

A FRAMEWORK FOR DATA AND
THE DIGITAL ECONOMY

Some people say that it is not for government to regulate when it comes to technology
and the internet. We disagree. While we cannot create this framework alone, it is for
government, not private companies, to protect the security of people and ensure the
fairness of the rules by which people and businesses abide. Nor do we agree that the
risks of such an approach outweigh the potential benefits. It is in the interests of stable
markets that consumers are protected from abusive behaviour, that money is able to
flow freely and securely, and that competition between businesses takes place on a level
playing field. It is in no-one’s interest for the foundations of strong societies and stable
democracies — the rule of law, privacy and security — to be undermined.

So we will establish a regulatory framework in law to underpin our digital charter and
to ensure that digital companies, social media platforms and content providers abide
by these principles. We will introduce a sanctions regime to ensure compliance, giving
regulators the ability to fine or prosecute those companies that fail in their legal duties,
and to order the removal of content where it clearly breaches UK law. We will also create
a power in law for government to introduce an industry-wide levy from social media
companies and communication service providers to support awareness and preventative
activity to counter internet harms, just as is already the case with the gambling industry.

Just as we led the world in regulating embryology thirty years ago, we know that if we create
the right system of governance for the digital economy and use of data, we will attract the
right businesses who want to become the global centre for data use and research.

 

82

5. PROSPERITY AND SECURITY IN A DIGITAL AGE

 

An international settlement
These are questions with which every nation is grappling. The internet is a global
network and it is only by concerted global action that we can make true progress.

We believe that the United Kingdom can lead the world in providing answers. So we will
open discussions with the leading tech companies and other like-minded democracies
about the global rules of the digital economy, to develop an international legal framework
that we have for so long benefited from in other areas like banking and trade. We
recognise the complexity of this task and that this will be the beginning of a process, but
it is a task which we believe is necessary and which we intend to lead.

By doing these things — a digital charter, a framework for data ethics, and a new
international agreement — we will put our great country at the head of this new revolution;
we will choose how technology forms our future; and we will demonstrate, even in the
face of unprecedented change, the good that government can do.

 

83

CONCLUSION

his is our plan for a stronger Britain and a prosperous future. This is

our vision of a nation united, of shared opportunity, of safe, vibrant and
sustainable communities and of a Great Meritocracy, where everyone, in every
part of our country, is given the chance to go wherever their talents will take
them. In this period of profound national change, we will only achieve our
ambitions if we have the strong and stable leadership our national interest
demands. With Theresa May and her team, we will secure the best possible deal
with the European Union and chart a course to a new global future. Now is the
time that we must show, once again, our strength as a nation and the character of
our united people. We shall succeed, if we go forward, together.

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

We have a plan for every stage of your life:

FOR THE BEST START IN LIFE

we will continue to increase spending on the NHS, provide 7-day a week access to your GP
and deliver a truly 7-day NHS ~ so you know you will always have access to a free and high quality
health service when you need it most.

FOR YOUR SCHOOL YEARS

we will maintain the amount of money that follows each child into school, ensure there is a good
primary school place available for every child and lift the cap on university places — so you have the
skills you need to succeed.

TO SECURE YOUR FIRST JOB

we will create 3 million new apprenticeships; take everyone earning less than £12,500 out of Income
Tax altogether and pass a law to ensure we have a Tax-Free Minimum Wage in this country; and
continue to create a fairer welfare system where benefits are capped to the level that makes work pay
— so you are rewarded for working hard and doing the right thing.

AS YOU RAISE YOUR FAMILY

we will extend the Right to Buy to Housing Association tenants, build 200,000 new Starter Homes

— 20 per cent below the market price, for first-time buyers under 40 — and provide 30 hours of free

childcare to working parents of three and four year-olds — so you are able to work while having the
security of your own home in which to raise your family.

WHILE YOU GROW OLDER

we will not raise VAT; National Insurance contributions or Income Tax but we will raise the 40p

Income Tax threshold to £50,000 and take the family home out of tax by increasing the effective

Inheritance Tax threshold for married couples and civil partners to £1 million — so you can keep
more of your income and pass it on to future generations.

AND WHEN YOU RETIRE

we will continue to increase the Basic State Pension by at least 2.5 per cent through the triple lock,
give you the freedom to use your pension savings as you want and pass them on tax-free and we
will cap the amount you can be charged for your residential care — so you can have the dignity and
security you deserve in your old age.

The next Conservative Government will secure a better
future for you, your family and Britain.

Foreword

 

Over the last five years, we have put our country back on the right track. Five years ago, Britain was on the brink. As the
outgoing Labour Treasury Minister put it with brutal candour, ‘there is no money’. Since then, we have turned things around.

Britain is now one of the fastest growing major economies in the world. We are getting our national finances back under
control. We have halved our deficit as a share of our economy. More people are in work than ever before. Britain is back on
its feet, strong and growing stronger every day.

This has not happened by accident. It is the result of difficult decisions and of patiently working through our long-term
economic plan. Above all, it is the product of a supreme national effort, in which everyone has made sacrifices and everyone
has played their part.

It is a profound Conservative belief that our country is made great not through the action of government alone, but
through the flair, the ingenuity and hard work of the British people — and so it has proved the last five years.

We can be proud of what we have achieved so far together, and especially proud that as we have taken hard decisions on
public spending, we have protected the National Health Service, with 9,500 more doctors and 6,900 more nurses, and
ensured generous rises in the State Pension.

Our friends and competitors overseas look at Britain, and they see a country that is putting its own house in order, a country
on the rise. They see a country that believes in itself, But our national recovery remains a work in progress. It is fragile, and
with the wrong decisions, it could easily be reversed.

So the central questions at this election are these: how do we maintain our economic recovery, upon which our ambitions for
our country depend? And how do we make sure that the recovery benefits every one of our citizens, at every stage of their lives?

This Manifesto sets out our plan to do just that. It is a plan for a better future — for you, for your family. It is a plan for
every stage of your life. For your new-born baby, there will be the world's best medical care. For your child, there will be a
place at an excellent school. As you look for your first job, we are building a healthy economy that provides a good career
for you with a decent income. As you look for that first home, we will make sure the Government is there to help. As you
raise your family, we will help you with childcare. And as you grow older, we will ensure that you have dignity in retirement.
Throughout, we will make sure that if you or your family fall ill, you will always be able to depend on our cherished
National Health Service to give you the care you need.

And in an increasingly dangerous and uncertain world, we will fulfil the most basic duty of government — to defend our
country and keep it safe.

But all of these things depend on a strong and growing econonny. So as you consider how to vote, I hope you will ask this:
which party is best placed to keep our economy strong? The team which has delivered the growing economy we have today,
which created more jobs since 2010 than the rest of the European Union put together; or the party which left behind a
ruined economy just five short years ago?

Now is a time to build on the progress we have made, not to put it all at risk. This Manifesto is our plan of action ~ our plan
to take our amazing country forward. Above all, it is a plan for you.

T hope you will give it your support, so that together, we can see through the task we have begun.

A strong economy to help you and your family

 

Our commitment to you:

Your job, your home, the mortgage you pay, the school your children go to, your local hospital,
your pension - all these things depend on a strong economy. So we will carry on working

through our long-term economic plan. We will:

m keep our economy secure by running a surplus so that we start paying down our debts

u increase the tax-free Personal Allowance to £12,500 and the 40p Income Tax threshold to

£50,000

m commit to no increases in VAT, National Insurance contributions or Income Tax

m crack down on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance and ensure those who can

afford to pay the most do

a rebalance our economy, build a Northern Powerhouse and back elected metro mayors

m pursue our ambition to become the most prosperous major economy in the world by the 2030s.

 

Our long-term economic plan is turning around Britain’s
economy. Five years ago, Britain was reeling from the
chaos of Labour’s Great Recession; in 2014 we were the
fastest growing of all the major advanced economies —
last year, we grew 75 per cent faster than Germany, three
times faster than the Eurozone and seven times faster
than France. Five years ago, the budget deficit was more
than 10 per cent of GDP, the highest in our peacetime
history, and the national debt was rising out of control;
today, the deficit is half that level and debt as a share of
national income will start falling this financial year.

The fastest growing of all the
major advanced economies

in 2014

 

Industries are coming back to life. Companies are striding
into new markets. Manufacturers are returning to our
shores. More tech companies are starting up here than
anywhere else in Europe. We have overtaken France as the
third largest car producer in Europe and there are 760,000
more businesses than in 2010 providing jobs and creating
wealth across the country.

The Great Recession has given way to a Great Revival,
which is creating on average 1,000 new jobs every day:
more than the rest of the European Union combined.
This is no accident. It is the product of hard work by
people in every part of the country and it is thanks to

the success of our long-term economic plan. By halving
the deficit, we have helped to restore confidence to the
economy. By maintaining fiscal discipline, we have helped
keep mortgage rates lower than they otherwise would be.
And by establishing the independent Office for Budget
Responsibility (OBR), we have ended — permanently — the
ability of politicians to cook the books for political gain

at the nation’s expense. With inflation at a record low, the
latest OBR forecasts show that living standards will be
higher in 2015 than in 2010, and are set to grow strongly
every year for the rest of the decade, with the average
family £900 better off. It is only by securing the recovery,
dealing with our debts and creating jobs that we can
continue to raise living standards. That means sticking to

 

our long-term economic plan; Britain is on the right path.

But the job is not finished. There are clouds on the
international horizon. Huge challenges remain at home.
We have cut the record deficit we inherited to five per
cent of GDP, but that is still too high. Our trade with
emerging economies is up, with exports to China more
than doubled since 2009, but overall we are still too

dependent on slow-growing European markets. Business
investment is rising, but we still underinvest compared
to other countries. Productivity remains too low. And
while prosperity is now spreading around the country,
our economic growth remains uneven, too reliant on
financial services.

1,000 jobs created for every day

of the Parliament since 2010

 

We will finish the job we started in a balanced way. Those
with the broadest shoulders have contributed the most

to deficit reduction — which is why inequality has fallen,
and child and pensioner poverty are down — and they will
continue to do so. We will increase NHS spending every
year. We will control spending, eliminate the deficit, and
start to run a surplus. We will go from stuck in the red, to
back in the black. By building on the foundations we have
put in place, we will have a truly national recovery and be
able to pursue our ambition for Britain to become the most
prosperous major economy in the world by the 2030s.

If we do not stick to our long-term economic plan, we
will slip back again, reversing the progress we have made
in the last five years. More borrowing — and the extra
debt interest that it brings — means there is less money

to spend on schools and hospitals. More spending
means higher taxes for hardworking people, and interest
rates that are higher than they otherwise would be —
punishing homeowners, hurting businesses, costing jobs.

A strong economy allows us
to invest in and protect our
public services like the NHS
and schools

And failing to control our debt would be more than an
economic failing; it would be a moral failing — leaving
our children and grandchildren with debts that they
could never hope to repay.

So you face a clear choice. Economic competence, with
David Cameron as Prime Minister, following through

on our long-term economic plan. Or economic chaos
under Labour, with higher taxes, more debt and no plan
to fix our public finances, create jobs or build a more
secure economy.

Our plan of action:

We will finish the job by eliminating the deficit
to keep our economy secure and keep your
taxes and mortgage payments down

Our long-term economic plan reflects our values: we as a
nation should not be piling up and passing on unaffordable
levels of debt to the next generation. We will eliminate the
deficit in a sensible and balanced way that will enable us to
continue to increase spending on the NHS and cut Income
Tax for 30 million working people.

Our deficit reduction plan has two phases. The first
will see us continue to reduce government spending by
one per cent each year in real terms for the first two full
financial years of the next Parliament, the same rate as
over the last five years. That means saving £1 a year

in every £100 that government spends. We don’t think
there’s a business that couldn’t do that — and we don’t
think government, when it is spending your money,
should be any different.

We have halved the deficit as a

share of our economy

 

That will require a further £30 billion in fiscal
consolidation over the next two years, on top of the
£120 billion that we have already identified and
delivered over this Parliament. We will find £13 billion
from departmental savings, the same rate of reduction
as in this Parliament. We will find £12 billion from
welfare savings, on top of the £21 billion of savings
delivered in this Parliament. And we will raise at least
£5 billion from continuing to tackle tax evasion, and
aggressive tax avoidance and tax planning, building
on the £7 billion of annual savings we have delivered
in this Parliament. This £30 billion of further
consolidation is necessary to ensure that debt keeps
falling as a share of GDP and to deliver a balanced

 

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

 

structural current budget in 2017-18, meeting the new
fiscal mandate that Parliament voted on earlier this year.

Our commitment goes further than this. A balanced
current budget is not enough to deliver a reliable
reduction in our level of national debt, which remains
far too high in a world of continuing economic
challenges. International evidence and Treasury analysis
shows that the only way to keep our economy secure

for the future is to eliminate the deficit entirely and start
running a surplus. Anything less would be to ignore the
lessons of the past.

That is why, in the second phase of our deficit reduction
plan starting in 2018-19, we are set to move into surplus,
with the Government taking in more than it is spending for
the first time in 18 years. That means we can start properly
paying down our debts and reducing the scale of annual
interest payments — reducing the UK’s vulnerability to
future shocks by fixing the roof while the sun is shining.
We will achieve this by continuing to control government
spending in 2018-19, no longer cutting it in real terms, but
instead growing it in line with inflation.

To eliminate the deficit we
must continue to cut out
wasteful spending and make
government more efficient,
effective and accountable

From 2019-20, after a surplus has been achieved,
spending will grow in line with GDP. A new fundamental
principle of fiscal policy, monitored by the independent
OBR, will ensure that in normal economic times, when
the economy is growing, the government will always run
a surplus in order to reduce our national debt and keep
our economy secure, with a state neither smaller than we
need nor bigger than we can afford. Total government
spending as a share of our national income at the end of
the next Parliament is forecast to be very slightly higher
than in the year 2000, the year before Labour lost all
control of spending and the national debt started its
longest rise for hundreds of years.

Our approach is focused on reducing wasteful spending,

making savings in welfare, and continuing to crack down
on tax evasion and aggressive avoidance. This means that
we can commit to no increases in VAT; Income Tax or
National Insurance. Tax rises on working people would
harm our economy, reduce living standards and cost
jobs. Instead, as we reduce the deficit, we will cut Income
Tax, as we have done over the last five years: during the
next Parliament, we will increase the tax-free Personal
Allowance to £12,500 and the higher rate threshold to
£50,000, so you keep more of your hard-earned money.

The richest are paying a greater

share of income tax than in any
of Labour's 13 years

 

We will continue to build a stronger, safer and
more secure banking system that serves its
customers and provides businesses with the
finance they need to grow and create jobs

We will make sure our financial services industry is the
best regulated in the world with our new system of
supervision led by the independent Bank of England.
Our new Financial Policy Committee will monitor and
control the growth of indebtedness and imbalances across
the whole economy ~ a vital task that was totally ignored
in the run up to the financial crisis. Our tough new
Financial Conduct Authority will protect consumers and
ensure that financial markets work for the benefit of the
whole economy. To protect hardworking taxpayers from
future banking crashes, we will finish the process of ring-
fencing banks’ high street branches from their investment
arms by 2019 at the latest. In order to ensure that new
pay structures for bankers rebuild trust and reduce short-
termism, we will ensure that Britain continues to have the
toughest regime of bonus deferral and clawback of any
financial centre. We will continue to sell the Government's
stakes in the bailed-out banks and building societies

in order to deliver value for money for taxpayers and
support the economy. Hardworking taxpayers supported
the banks during the financial crisis and so the banks
should in turn support them during the recovery — that

is why we will keep the bank levy in place and restrict
established banks’ ability to pay less tax by offsetting their
profits against past losses.

We will make the banks work for you

Our plan is to ensure banks help secure our recovery
and back businesses to create jobs and growth in our
economy. We capped payday lenders, made it easier
for you to switch your bank account and will continue
to support the credit union movement in making
financial services more accessible. We will continue the
successful Funding for Lending scheme into 2016. We
will help new and existing challenger banks to inject
fresh competition into the market for personal current
accounts, mortgages and business loans, including
through the British Business Bank, while backing the
financial technology revolution. We will improve our
support for investment into start-ups and roll-out our
innovative Help to Grow scheme, which will plug a £1
billion finance gap for firms that are looking to expand,
invest and take on new employees.

We will continue to lead the world on tax and
transparency

Tackling tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance and
tax planning is an important part of our long-term
economic plan. We will increase the annual tax charges
paid by those with non-domiciled status, ensuring that
they make a fair contribution to reducing the deficit,
and continue to tackle abuses of this status. We will
lead international efforts to ensure global companies
pay their fair share in tax, as David Cameron did at
the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013, which
secured significant international progress on fairer

tax rules and full transparency over who really owns
companies. We will push for all countries to sign up

to the Extractive Industries ‘Transparency Initiative;
review the implementation of the new international
country-by-country tax reporting rules and consider the
case for making this information publicly available on a
multilateral basis. We will ensure developing countries
have full access to global automatic tax information
exchange systems and continue to build the capacity

of tax authorities in developing countries. We are also
making it a crime if companies fail to put in place
measures to stop economic crime, such as tax evasion, in

We are fixing the economy
so that everyone feels the
benefit

their organisations and making sure that the penalties are
large enough to punish and deter.

We will rebalance our economy and build a
Northern Powerhouse

We are committed to a truly national recovery, benefiting all
parts of our country. We have devolved powers to Scotland
and Wales, and set out long-term economic plans to raise

the growth rate of all parts of England, bringing areas which
have grown more slowly up to at least the national average.
Over the last year, the North grew faster than the South. By
connecting up the North with modern transport links, we
will enable its great cities and towns to pool their strengths.
We will invest a record £13 billion in transport for the North.
We will electrify the main rail routes, build the Northern
Hub, and provide new trains for the North. We will upgrade
the Al, M62, M1 and A555 link road. And that is on top of
our £50 billion commitment to build High Speed 2 — the
new North-South railway linking up London with the West
Midlands, Leeds and Manchester — and develop High Speed
3 to join up the North. We will back scientific and technical
strengths by creating new institutions such as Health North;
the Royce Institute for Advanced Materials in Manchester,
Leeds, Liverpool and Sheffield; the National Centre for
Ageing Science and Innovation in Newcastle; the Cognitive
Computing centre at Daresbury; and by making investments
in energy research in Blackpool, Cumbria and Thornton.

We will back new jobs in the South West

To help attract growth and new businesses we will
improve connections to the South West with major
investment in the M5, A358, A30 and A303, and

the electrification of the Great Western Main Line —
bringing new fast trains on the route. We will invest to
boost tourism in the South West and ensure the world-
class defence assets and cyber-security industries of the
South West benefit the local economy.

Britain's exports are growing
fastest in the North East and

our employment fastest in the
North West

We will make the Midlands an engine
of growth

We will back business by investing a record £5.2 billion
in better transport, upgrading the M1 and M6, and
electrifying the Midland Main Line from St Pancras

to Sheffield — putting the Midlands at the centre of

a modern, inter-connected transport network for the
UK. We will back the Midlands’ strength in advanced
manufacturing, engineering and science with major
projects such as the Energy Research Accelerator and
support for innovation in the motor industry.

We will properly connect the East of England
and back innovation

We will improve rail connections to East Anglia,
delivering “Norwich in 90 minutes’ and ‘Ipswich in 60
minutes’ and upgrade key roads like the Al] and A47.
We will support the creation of new jobs by backing the
East’s great strengths — agri-tech, high-tech businesses
around Cambridge, and energy businesses at Great
Yarmouth and Lowestoft.

We support policies that grow
the economy as a whole,
generating new jobs and
higher wages for everybody

We will devolve powers and budgets to boost
local growth in England

We will devolve far-reaching powers over economic
development, transport and social care to large cities which
choose to have elected mayors. We will legislate to deliver
the historic deal for Greater Manchester, which will devolve
powers and budgets and lead to the creation of a directly
elected Mayor for Greater Manchester. In Cambridgeshire,
Greater Manchester and Cheshire East, we will pilot
allowing local councils to retain 100 per cent of growth

in business rates, so they reap the benefit of decisions that
boost growth locally. We will devolve further powers over
skills spending and planning to the Mayor of London.

And we will deliver more bespoke Growth Deals with

local councils, where locally supported, and back Local
Enterprise Partnerships to promote jobs and growth.

Better roads, trains and modern communications

 

Our commitment to you:

You depend on infrastructure at every stage of your life: to go to school, to go to work, to enable
businesses to grow and create jobs for your children and grandchildren. We have a plan of
action that will improve our roads, railways, airports and internet connections. We will:

a invest in infrastructure to attract businesses and good jobs across the whole of the UK

mu make your life easier, with more and faster trains, more roads and cycle routes

a keep commuter rail fares frozen in real terms for the whole of the next Parliament

a roll out universal broadband and better mobile phone connections, to ensure everyone is

part of the digital economy.

 

Under Labour, road and rail were starved of resources,
while too many people were stuck on the wrong side of the
digital divide. This meant packed trains, potholes, patchy
broadband coverage — businesses held back and cities left
behind. Turning these problems around takes time.

Improving our trains, roads
and broadband helps local
businesses grow and create
more jobs and opportunities

But because we have made savings elsewhere, we

have been able to make significant investments in
infrastructure. We will commit, alongside running a
surplus, to increase our capital spending — investment in
infrastructure — at least in line with our national income.
We have set out a plan to invest over £100 billion in our
infrastructure over the next Parliament.

This will fund the biggest investment in rail since

Victorian times, and the most extensive improvements
to our roads since the 1970s. And it will give us the

We are investing over £2 billion

electrifying our railways

 

most comprehensive and cheapest superfast broadband
coverage of any major European country.

Our plan of action:

We will spend more on infrastructure, to
improve your quality of life

Overall public investment will be higher on average over
this decade, as a percentage of GDP, than under the
whole period of the last Labour Government. We will
deliver on our National Infrastructure Plan and respond
to the Airports Commission’s final report.

We will transform our railway network

We will invest £38 billion in our railway network in the five
years to 2019. Electrification of the railways is a key part of
our investment programme, with work already underway
across the North, the Midlands, and South Wales; there

are plans to go further in the rest of the country, including
East Anglia and the South West. In addition to rolling out
our national high-speed rail network, with High Speed 2
and High Speed 3, we will complete the construction of the
new east-west Crossrail across Greater London, and push
forward with plans for Crossrail 2, a new rail route running
through London and connecting Surrey and Hertfordshire.
We will support a fairer deal for taxpayers and commuters:
we will keep commuter rail fares frozen in real terms for the
whole of the next Parliament — regulated fares will only be

 

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

 

able to rise by Retail Price Inflation, and train operating
companies will not have any flexibility to raise ticket prices
above this. We will also introduce smart ticketing and part-
time season tickets and require train companies to improve
compensation arrangements for passengers when trains
are more than a few minutes late. We are investing millions
of pounds in fitting out trains with new wi-fi equipment
and improving mobile phone signals, which will benefit
passengers on trains across England and Wales.

We will support motorists and invest in our
roads, to save you time and money

We abolished Labour’s fuel duty escalator, and instead
have frozen fuel duty, delivering the longest duty freeze
in 20 years. We will invest £15 billion in roads. This will
include over £6 billion in the northern road network,
with the dualling and widening of the Al north of
Newcastle and the first new trans-Pennine road capacity
in over 40 years. We will take action to tackle some of
the most notorious and longstanding problems on our
road network, including improvements to the A303,
A47 and A27. We will add 1,300 extra lane miles to our
roads, improve over 60 problem junctions, and continue
to provide enough funding to fix around 18 million
potholes nationwide between 2015 and 2021.

We will make motoring greener and promote
cycling, to protect your environment

Our aim is for almost every car and van to be a zero
emission vehicle by 2050 — and we will invest £500
million over the next five years to achieve it. We want

to double the number of journeys made by bicycle and
will invest over £200 million to make cycling safer, so we
reduce the number of cyclists and other road users killed
or injured on our roads every year.

We are investing £790 million
extending superfast broadband
to rural areas - with 2 million

UK premises already connected
and 40,000 being upgraded
every week

 

We will deliver faster internet, to help you
work and communicate more easily

We will secure the delivery of superfast broadband in
urban and rural areas to provide coverage to 95 per
cent of the UK by the end of 2017, and we will ensure
no one is left behind by subsidising the cost of installing
superfast capable satellite services in the very hardest to
reach areas. We will also release more spectrum from
public sector use to allow greater private sector access.
And we have set an ambition that ultrafast broadband
should be available to nearly all UK premises as soon as
practicable.

We will boost mobile coverage, so you can
stay connected

We will hold the mobile operators to their new legally
binding agreement to ensure that 90 per cent of the UK
landmass will have voice and SMS coverage by 2017.
We will continue to invest in mobile infrastructure to
deliver coverage for voice calls and text messages for

the final 0.3 — 0.4 per cent of UK premises that do not
currently have it. We will ensure that Britain seizes the
chance to be a world leader in the development of 5G,
playing a key role in defining industry standards.

Jobs for all

 

Our commitment to you:

Whatever stage of life you are at - whether you're looking for your first job out of school, or
coming to the end of your career - we will work to help you enjoy the satisfaction and rewards

of a decent job. We will:

a help businesses to create two million new jobs, so we achieve full employment

m give businesses the most competitive taxes of any major economy

a back small firms with a major business rates review

m= support three million new apprenticeships, so young people acquire the skills to succeed

 

If you want to live in the most vibrant and dynamic
country in the world, this election matters. Only the
Conservatives have the vision, the optimism, the ambition
and the discipline to transform Britain. That’s because we
know that a decent job is the best weapon against poverty
and the best way to provide security for families.

Britain has created more

jobs than the rest of the EU
put together since 2010

 

Thanks to the success of our long-term economic plan,
Britain is creating more jobs than the 27 other countries
of the European Union put together. That means more
people with the security of a regular pay packet. Over
the past five years, 1.9 million new jobs have been
created; 1,000 jobs for every single day that we have
been in government.

This represents a transformation in many people’s
lives; giving families more security; boosting the self-
esteem of young people taken on; and providing hope
for those who have been unemployed for years.

But we need to go further. We have set out the bold
aim of achieving full employment, with the highest
employment rate of any major economy. We want
Britain to be the best place in the world to start a
business and will create another two million jobs over

the next Parliament. We will abolish long-term youth
unemployment, and make sure that all young people
are either earning or learning. And we will make our
economy more inclusive, by removing barriers that
stop women and disabled people from participating in
our workforce.

A job is the best way to
provide security for
families

To achieve this, we will back British businesses: cutting
red tape, lowering taxes on jobs and enterprise, getting
young people into work, boosting apprenticeships

and investing in science and technology. With the
Conservatives, Britain will be the best place in Europe

to innovate, patent new ideas and set up and expand a
business. We aim to be number one in Europe and in the
top five worldwide in the World Bank’s Doing Business
rankings by 2020 and to lead Europe in attracting foreign
investment.

Backing business also means helping our farmers and

our rural communities. Neglected for 13 years under
Labour, we have started the process of championing and
connecting up the countryside. In the coming years, we
will go further, helping our farmers, supporting British food
around the world and opening up new export markets.

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

 

This is all at risk if the Labour Party forms the government.
Their policies to spend more, borrow more and tax more
would be catastrophic for Britain’s businesses — and for all
the families thrown back into the despair of joblessness and
financial uncertainty.

Our plan will help to
generate jobs and higher
wages for everybody

Our plan of action:

We will boost apprenticeships and help you
secure a good job

We have already delivered 2.2 million new apprenticeships
over the last five years. Over the next five years, we will
deliver three million more and ensure they deliver the skills
employers need. We aim to achieve full employment in

the UK, with the highest employment rate in the G7, and
we will help businesses create two million jobs over the
Parliament. We have abolished the jobs tax — employers!
National Insurance contributions (NICs) — for the under 21s
and next year we will do the same for young apprentices
under 25. We will continue to help smaller businesses take
on new workers through the Employment Allowance, which
frees businesses from the first £2,000 of employers’ NICs so
that a third of employers pay no jobs tax.

We will support business to

keep creating 1,000 jobs a day
over the next five years

 

We will aim to abolish long-term youth
unemployment

Our economic plan has helped deliver sharp falls in long-
term youth unemployment, taking the numbers of 16-18
year-olds not in education, employment or training to
historic lows. We will provide support to those 16 —17 year-
olds still not in education, employment or training and to

those who risk becoming so. Jobcentre Plus advisers will work
with schools and colleges to supplement careers advice and
provide routes into work experience and apprenticeships. But
it is not fair — on taxpayers, or on young people themselves

~ that 18-21 year-olds with no work experience should slip
straight into a life on benefits without first contributing to
their community. So we will introduce tougher Day One
Work Requirements for young people claiming out-of-work
benefits. We will replace the Jobseeker’s Allowance for 18-21
year-olds with a Youth Allowance that will be time-limited

to six months, after which young people will have to take an
apprenticeship, a traineeship or do daily community work
for their benefits. It is also not fair that taxpayers should

have to pay for 18-21 year-olds on Jobseeker’s Allowance to
claim Housing Benefit in order to leave home. So we will
ensure that they no longer have an automatic entitlement to
Housing Benefit.

We will reward entrepreneurship

To support jobs, we cut Corporation Tax from 28 to 20 per
cent over the course of the Parliament, reduced National
Insurance bills and capped the rise in business rates. We
have extended 100 per cent Small Business Rate Relief
and are providing extra support for high street shops by
increasing the business rates retail discount to £1,500.

In the next Parliament, we want to maintain the most
competitive business tax regime in the G20, and oppose
Labour's plans to increase Corporation Tax. We will
conduct a major review into business rates by the end of
2015 to ensure that from 2017 they properly reflect the
structure of our modern economy and provide clearer
billing, better information sharing and a more efficient
appeal system.

We will protect you from disruptive and
undemocratic strike action

Strikes should only ever be the result of a clear, positive
decision based on a ballot in which at least half the
workforce has voted. This turnout threshold will be an
important and fair step to rebalance the interests of
employers, employees, the public and the rights of trade
unions. We will, in addition, tackle the disproportionate
impact of strikes in essential public services by introducing
a tougher threshold in health, education, fire and transport.
Industrial action in these essential services would require
the support of at least 40 per cent of all those entitled

to take part in strike ballots — as well as a majority of

 

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

 

Britain has the most competitive

business tax regime in the G20 -
and we want to keep it that way

 

those who actually turn out to vote. We will also repeal
nonsensical restrictions banning employers from hiring
agency staff to provide essential cover during strikes; and
ensure strikes cannot be called on the basis of ballots
conducted years before. We will tackle intimidation of
non-striking workers; legislate to ensure trade unions

use a transparent opt-in process for union subscriptions;
tighten the rules around taxpayer-funded paid ‘facility
time’ for union representatives; and reform the role of the
Certification Officer.

We will cut red tape, boost start-ups and small
businesses

This Government was the first in post-war history to
reduce the burden of regulation. We will cut a further
£10 billion of red tape over the next Parliament
through our Red Tape Challenge and our One-In-
Two-Out rule. This will support our aim to make
Britain the best place in Europe, and one of the top five
worldwide, to do business by 2020. We will also treble
our successful Start Up Loans programme during the
next Parliament so that 75,000 entrepreneurs get the
chance to borrow money to set up their own business.
We will raise the target for SMEs’ share of central
government procurement to one-third, strengthen

the Prompt Payment Code and ensure that all major
government suppliers sign up. We have already helped
small businesses by increasing the Annual Investment
Allowance, reducing the burden of employment law
through our successful tribunal reforms and supporting
27,000 new business mentors. We will go further by
establishing a new Small Business Conciliation service
to mediate in disputes, especially over late payment.

The gender pay gap is down toa
record low - and there are more

women on FTSE 100 boards
than ever before

 

The creation of the Office of Tax Simplification (OTS)
in 2010 has resulted in many improvements to the UK
tax system. We will establish the OTS on a permanent
basis and expand its role and capacity. We will boost our
support for first-time exporters and back the GREAT
campaign, so we achieve our goal of having 100,000
more UK companies exporting in 2020 than in 2010
and reach our target of £1 trillion in exports. And we
will set a new, significantly higher, permanent level for
the Annual Investment Allowance.

We will fight for equal opportunity

Last year alone, 140,000 disabled people found work. But
the jobless rate for this group remains too high and, as part
of our objective to achieve full employment, we will aim
to halve the disability employment gap: we will transform
policy, practice and public attitudes, so that hundreds of
thousands more disabled people who can and want to be
in work find employment. We now have more women-led
businesses than ever before, more women in work than
ever before and more women on FTSE 100 boards than
ever before. We want to see full, genuine gender equality.
The gender pay gap is the lowest on record, but we want
to reduce it further and will push business to do so: we
will require companies with more than 250 employees to
publish the difference between the average pay of their
male and female employees. Under Labour, women

Our aim is to make Britain
the best place to do business
in Europe

accounted for only one in eight FT'SE 100 board members.
They represent a quarter of board members today and we
want to see this rise further in the next Parliament. We also
want to increase the proportion of public appointments
going to women in the next Parliament, as well as the
number of female MPs.

We will back you at work

Now that the economy is growing strongly again, we have
seen the first real-terms increase in the National Minimum
Wage since Labour’s Great Recession began. We strongly
support the National Minimum Wage and want to see
further real-terms increases in the next Parliament. We

accept the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission
that the National Minimum Wage should rise to £6.70 this
autumn, on course for a Minimum Wage that will be over
£8 by the end of the decade. We also support the Living
Wage and will continue to encourage businesses and other
organisations to pay it whenever they can afford it. We will
also take further steps to eradicate abuses of workers, such
as non-payment of the Minimum Wage, exclusivity in zero-
hours contracts and exploitation of migrant workers.

We will continue to invest in science, back our
industrial strategies and make Britain the
technology centre of Europe

Great science is worthwhile in its own right and yields
enormous practical benefits too — curing diseases, driving
technological innovation, promoting business investment
and informing public policy for the better. We ring-

fenced the science budget by making difficult choices

to reduce spending in other areas. Now we will invest

new capital on a record scale — £6.9 billion in the UK’s
research infrastructure up to 2021 — which will mean new
equipment, new laboratories and new research institutes.
This long-term commitment includes £2.9 billion for a
Grand Challenges Fund, which will allow us to invest in
major research facilities of national significance, such as
the new Alan Turing Institute, and projects such as the
Polar Research Ship and Square Kilometre Array. We have
boosted research and development tax credits and we will
continue to support our network of University Enterprise
Zones, ensuring that Britain's world-beating universities are
able to make money from the technology they develop. We
will support our modern industrial strategies, such as our
successful Life Sciences strategy, to help people compete
and win in the intense global race for high value, high
knowledge jobs. We will work with the Automotive Council
in support of our resurgent car industry and direct further
resources towards the Eight Great ‘Technologies — among
them robotics and nanotechnology — where Britain is set to
be a global leader. We have delivered a network of catapult
centres — R&D hubs in the technologies of the future —
and we will create more to ensure that we have a bold and

Inequality is down from the

record high it reached under
Labour

 

comprehensive offer in place for Britain’s researchers and
innovators.

We will support the rural economy and
strengthen local communities

We have the land, the technology, and the entrepreneurial
flair to enable us to make the most of the economic
potential of our rural areas. We will provide rural Britain
with near universal superfast broadband by the end of
the next Parliament and secure the future of 3,000 rural
Post Offices. We know how important it is to preserve
vital community assets such as pubs, town halls and sports
facilities, so we will strengthen the Community Right to
Bid that we created. We will extend the length of time
communities have to purchase these assets, and require
owners to set a clear ‘reserve’ price for the community

to aim for when bidding. We will set up a Pub Loan

Fund to enable community groups to obtain small loans
to pay for feasibility work, lawyers’ fees, or materials for
refurbishment, where they have bid to run the pub as part
of our reforms to the Community Asset Register.

We will champion our farmers and food
producers

We will set out a long-term vision for the future of British
farming, working with industry to develop a 25 year plan
to grow more, buy more and sell more British food. We will
allow farmers to smooth their profits for tax purposes over
five years, up from the current two years, to counter income
volatility. We will treble the number of apprenticeships in
food, farming and agri-tech, as part of our plan to secure
three million more apprenticeships. We will support a
science-led approach on GM crops and pesticides and
implement our 25-year strategy to eradicate bovine TB.
We will liberate farmers from red tape by coordinating all
visits through a single Farm Inspection Taskforce, which
will involve farmers themselves and use data from existing
industry schemes, such as Red Tractor. We will push for
further reform of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy.
We will promote British food abroad by setting up a Great
British Food Unit to help trademark and promote local
foods around the world and back British food at home,

by guaranteeing that all central government departments
purchase food to British standards of production by the
end of the Parliament. We will also help consumers to
buy British by pushing for country of origin labelling in
Europe, particularly for dairy products, following on from

our success with beef, lamb, pork and poultry. And we will
champion our new Groceries Code Adjudicator, so farmers
receive a fair deal from the supermarkets.

We will support our fishing and coastal
communities

We will defend our hard-won Common Fisheries Policy
reforms, which include ending the scandalous practice of
discarding perfectly edible fish and reforming the quota
system so that all at-risk species, including cod, plaice,
haddock and seabass, will be fished sustainably by the end
of the next Parliament. We will continue to devolve the

management of North Sea fisheries to local communities,
and rebalance the UK’s inland water quotas to smaller,
specific locally-based fishing communities.

We will support countryside pursuits

We will protect hunting, shooting and fishing, for all the
benefits to individuals, the environment and the rural
economy that these activities bring. A Conservative
Government will give Parliament the opportunity to repeal
the Hunting Act on a free vote, with a government bill in
government time.

Cutting your taxes and building

a fairer welfare system

 

Our commitment to you:

Our goal is a country that not only rewards those who work hard and do the right thing, but
gives everyone - no matter their background - the chance to fulfil their potential. Achieving this
means seeing through our major reforms of tax and welfare. We will:

= cut income tax for 30 million people, taking everyone who earns less than £12,500 out of

Income Tax altogether

m pass a new law so that nobody working 30 hours on the Minimum Wage pays Income

Tax on what they earn

a back aspiration by raising the 40p tax threshold - so that no one earning less than £50,000

pays it

= cap overall welfare spending, lower the amount of benefits that any household can receive
to £23,000 and continue to roll out Universal Credit, to make work pay

a bring in tax-free childcare to support parents back into work, and give working parents
of 3 and 4-year-olds 30 hours of free childcare a week.

 

Under Labour, those who worked hard found more and
more of their earnings taken away in tax to support

a welfare system that allowed, and even encouraged,
people to choose benefits when they could be earning a
living. This sent out terrible signals: if you did the right
thing, you were penalised — and if you did the wrong
thing, you were rewarded, with the unfairness of it all
infuriating hardworking people.

We have cut Income Tax for
over 26 million people - and

taken over 3 million people out
of Income Tax altogether

 

Over the last five years, we have cut people’s taxes
wherever possible. We have raised the tax-free Personal
Allowance to £10,600 from £6,475: over 26 million
people are now keeping more of their hard-earned
money and 3 million of the lowest paid are paying no

Income ‘Tax at all. We believe that cutting people’s taxes
is the right thing to do ~ not only because it is your
money, but also because cutting the taxes of the lowest
paid and helping them stand on their own two feet is the
most effective poverty-tackling measure there is.

Real fairness means that where people really cannot
work, they must be supported — but where they are

able to work, they should. We have made long overdue
changes to our welfare system. We have capped benefits
so no household can take more in out-of-work benefits
than the average household earns by going out to work.
We have begun to introduce Universal Credit — a way
to simplify benefits into a new single payment — so that
work always pays. We are reassessing those on incapacity
benefits so that help goes to those who really need it.
The days of something for nothing are over — and all
this has helped to reduce by 900,000 the number of
people living in workless households.

In the next Parliament, we will continue to reward hard
work: raising the tax-free Personal Allowance so that
those working 30 hours on the Minimum Wage pay

The goal of welfare reform
should be to reward hard
work and protect the
vulnerable

no Income Tax at all and taking hardworking people
out of a 40p higher rate tax band originally meant to
capture only the wealthy. And we will see through our
welfare reforms, lowering the benefit cap and rolling out
Universal Credit, to make the system fairer and reward
hard work.

Our plan of action:
We will reward work

A Conservative Government will not increase the rates
of VAT, Income Tax or National Insurance in the next
Parliament. Instead, we will ease the burden of taxation
by raising the tax-free Personal Allowance — the amount
you can earn before you start paying tax — to £12,500.
This will cut Income Tax for 30 million people and take
everyone who earns less than £12,500 out of Income
Tax altogether. That means by the end of the decade,
one million more people on the lowest wages will be
lifted out of Income Tax, and people who work for 30
hours a week on the increased National Minimum Wage
will no longer pay any Income Tax at all. We will pass

a new law so that the Personal Allowance automatically
rises in line with the National Minimum Wage. The
new Tax Free Minimum Wage law will be applied from
the first Budget after the General Election. The change
will update the 1977 'Rooker-Wise' amendment which
forced governments to uprate tax thresholds in line with
inflation, meaning the Personal Allowance will now
increase more quickly.

We will cut Income Tax for 30
million people - so that hard

work is always rewarded

 

We will back your ambition

The 40p tax rate was only supposed to be paid by the
best-off people in our country. But in the past couple of
decades, far too many have been dragged into it.

We have already announced an above-inflation increase
in the threshold next year. Now we will raise the 40p
tax threshold much further, so that no one earning less
than £50,000 pays the higher rate of Income ‘Tax. The
800,000 people earning between £42,385 and £50,000
will no longer pay the 40p rate of tax.

We will support you as you raise your family

We will support you, whether you choose to go out to
work or stay at home to raise your children. We will
back the institution of marriage in our society, enabling
married couples to transfer £1,060 of their tax-free
income to their husband or wife, where the highest earner
is a basic rate taxpayer. This applies to civil partnerships
too, and the transferable amount will always rise at least
in line with the Personal Allowance. And we will help
families stay together and handle the stresses of modern
life by continuing to invest at least £7.5 million a year in
relationship support.

We will bring in tax-free childcare to help
parents return to work, and give working
parents of three and four year-olds 30 hours
of free childcare a week

We have already legislated to introduce tax-free
childcare in the next Parliament — worth up to £2,000
per child per year — to help parents who want to work.
We introduced 15 hours a week of free childcare for all
three and four-year olds and the most deprived two-
year-olds. And because working families with children
under school age face particularly high childcare costs,
in the next Parliament we will give families where all
parents are working an entitlement to 30 hours of free
childcare for their three and four year-olds.

We will cap the UK's overall welfare spending,
to save you money

We will keep a check on the growth of welfare spending,
enabling us to provide a system that is fair to those who

need it, and fair to those who pay for it too. Our overall

welfare cap will limit the amount that government

A welfare system that is fair

to those who need it, and fair

to those who pay for it too:
stopping benefit cheats and
ending welfare abuse

can spend on certain social security benefits in the five
years from 2015-16. We will freeze working age benefits
for two years from April 2016, with exemptions for
disability and pensioner benefits — as at present — as
well as maternity allowance, statutory maternity pay,
statutory paternity pay, statutory adoption pay and
statutory sick pay. We will deliver Universal Credit,

in order to provide the right incentives for people to
work; target support at those who need it most; reduce
fraud and error; and streamline administration of the
welfare system. We will work to eliminate child poverty
and introduce better measures to drive real change

We will lower the benefit cap
from £26,000 to £23,000 to

reward work

 

in children’s lives, by recognising the root causes of
poverty: entrenched worklessness, family breakdown,
problem debt, and drug and alcohol dependency.

We will reduce the household benefit cap to
make the system fairer

We will lower the maximum amount that a single
household can claim in benefits each year from
£26,000 to £23,000, so we reward work. We will
continue to have exemptions from the cap for those
receiving Disability Living Allowance or the Personal
Independence Payment.

We will help you back into work if you have a
long-term yet treatable condition

We will make sure the hardest to help receive the support
they need for a fulfilling life. We will review how best

to support those suffering from long-term yet treatable
conditions, such as drug or alcohol addiction, or obesity,
back into work. People who might benefit from treatment
should get the medical help they need so they can return
to work. If they refuse a recommended treatment, we will
review whether their benefits should be reduced. We will
also provide significant new support for mental health,
benefiting thousands of people claiming out-of-work
benefits or being supported by Fit for Work.

Controlled immigration that benefits Britain

 

Our commitment to you:

Our plan to control immigration will put you, your family and the British people first. We will
reduce the number of people coming to our country with tough new welfare conditions and

robust enforcement. We will:

a keep our ambition of delivering annual net migration in the tens of thousands, not the

hundreds of thousands

= control migration from the European Union, by reforming welfare rules

= clamp down on illegal immigration and abuse of the Minimum Wage

= enhance our border security and strengthen the enforcement of immigration rules

m develop a fund to ease pressure on local areas and public services.

 

Conservatives believe in controlled immigration, not
mass immigration. Immigration brings real benefits to
Britain — to our economy, our culture and our national
life. We will always be a party that is open, outward-
looking and welcoming to people from all around

the world. We also know that immigration must be
controlled. When immigration is out of control, it puts
pressure on schools, hospitals and transport; and it can
cause social pressures if communities find it hard to
integrate.

We must work to control
immigration and put
Britain first

Between 1997 and 2009, under the last Labour
Government, we had the largest influx of people Britain
had ever seen. Their open borders policy, combined
with their failure to reform welfare, meant that for

years over 90 percent of employment growth in this
country was accounted for by foreign nationals — even
though there were 1.4 million people who spent most
of the 2000s living on out-of-work benefits. For the past
five years, we have been working to turn around the
situation we inherited.

Since 2010, we have stripped more than 850 bogus

colleges of their rights to sponsor foreign students;
installed proper exit checks at our borders; cracked
down on illegal working and sham marriages; made

it harder for people to live in the UK illegally, by
restricting their access to bank accounts, driving licences
and private housing; and reduced the number of

appeal routes to stop people clogging up our courts with
spurious attempts to remain in the country. All of this
has made a difference. Immigration from outside the
EU has come down since 2010.

Non-EU migration cut by 13 per

cent - and economic migration
from outside the EU capped

 

We have seen many more people from the EU coming
to Britain than originally anticipated, principally
because our economy has been growing so much more
rapidly and creating more jobs than other EU countries.
As a result, our action has not been enough to cut
annual net migration to the tens of thousands. That
ambition remains the right one. But it is clearly going to
take more time, more work and more difficult long-term
decisions to achieve. Continuing this vital work will be
our priority over the next five years.

We will negotiate new rules with the EU, so that people

will have to be earning here for a number of years
before they can claim benefits, including the tax credits
that top up low wages. Instead of something-for-
nothing, we will build a system based on the principle
of something-for-something. We will then put these
changes to the British people in a straight in-out
referendum on our membership of the European Union
by the end of 2017. At the same time, we will continue
to strengthen our borders, improve the enforcement of
our immigration laws and act to make sure people leave
at the end of their visas. Across the spectrum, from the
student route to the family and work routes, we will
build a system that truly puts you, your family and the
British people first.

Our plan of action:

We will regain control of EU migration by
reforming welfare rules

Changes to welfare to cut EU migration will be an
absolute requirement in the renegotiation. We have
already banned housing benefit for EU jobseekers, and
restricted other benefits, including Jobseeker's Allowance.
We will insist that EU migrants who want to claim tax
credits and child benefit must live here and contribute

to our country for a minimum of four years. This will
reduce the financial incentive for lower-paid, lower-
skilled workers to come to Britain. We will introduce a
new residency requirement for social housing, so that EU
migrants cannot even be considered for a council house
unless they have been living in an area for at least four
years. If an EU migrant’s child is living abroad, then
they should receive no child benefit or child tax credit,
no matter how long they have worked in the UK and

no matter how much tax they have paid. To reduce the
numbers of EU migrants coming to Britain, we will end
the ability of EU jobseekers to claim any job-seeking
benefits at all. And if jobseekers have not found a job
within six months, they will be required to leave.

Tougher tests for migrants

before they can claim benefits

 

We will tackle criminality and abuse of free
movement

We will negotiate with the EU to introduce stronger
powers to deport criminals and stop them coming back,
and tougher and longer re-entry bans for all those who
abuse free movement. We want to toughen requirements
for non-EU spouses to join EU citizens, including with
an income threshold and English language test. And
when new countries are admitted to the EU in future,
we will insist that free movement cannot apply to those
new members until their economies have converged
much more closely with existing Member States.

We will continue to cut immigration from
outside the EU

We have already capped the level of skilled economic
migration from outside the EU. We will maintain our
cap at 20,700 during the next Parliament. This will
ensure that we only grant visas to those who have the
skills we really need in our economy. We will reform the
student visa system with new measures to tackle abuse
and reduce the numbers of students overstaying once
their visas expire. Our action will include clamping
down on the number of so-called ‘satellite campuses”
opened in London by universities located elsewhere

in the UK, and reviewing the highly trusted sponsor
system for student visas. And as the introduction of exit
checks will allow us to place more responsibility on visa
sponsors for migrants who overstay, we will introduce
targeted sanctions for those colleges or businesses that
fail to ensure that migrants comply with the terms of
their visa.

We will strengthen the enforcement of
immigration rules

We have introduced a ‘deport first, appeal later’ rule
for foreign national offenders. We will now remove
even more illegal immigrants by extending this rule to
all immigration appeals and judicial reviews, including
where a so-called right to family life is involved, apart
from asylum claims. We will also implement a new
removals strategy to take away opportunities for spurious
legal challenge and opportunities to abscond. We will
introduce satellite tracking for every foreign national
offender subject to an outstanding deportation order or
deportation proceedings. And we will implement the

 

30

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

 

requirement for all landlords to check the immigration
status of their tenants.

We will tackle people trafficking and exploitation

We have already re-introduced a proper system of exit
checks across the country, passed a Modern Slavery
Act that will protect people from exploitation, and
quadrupled the fines for unscrupulous employers who
undercut the Minimum Wage. Now we will introduce
tougher labour market regulation to tackle illegal
working and exploitation. To crack down further on
illegal working, we will harness data from multiple
agencies, including Exit Checks data, to identify illegal
immigrants and businesses that employ illegal workers.
And to incentivise tougher action on employers who do
not pay the minimum wage, we will allow inspection
teams to reinvest more of the money raised by fines
levied on employers.

We will ease pressure on public services and
your local community

We are taking unprecedented action to tackle health
tourism and will recover up to £500 million from
migrants who use the NHS by the middle of the next
Parliament. ‘To help communities experiencing high and
unexpected volumes of immigration, we will introduce

a new Controlling Migration Fund to ease pressures
on services and to pay for additional immigration
enforcement. To prevent sectors becoming partially or
wholly reliant on foreign workers, we will require those
regularly utilising the Shortage Occupation List, under
which they can bring skilled foreign workers into the
UK, to provide long-term plans for training British
workers.

We will protect British values
and our way of life

We will promote integration and British values

Being able to speak English is a fundamental part of
integrating into our society. We have introduced tough
new language tests for migrants and ensured councils
reduce spending on translation services. Next, we

will legislate to ensure that every public sector worker
operating in a customer-facing role must speak fluent
English. And to encourage better integration into our
society, we will also require those coming to Britain on
a family visa with only basic English to become more
fluent over time, with new language tests for those
seeking a visa extension.

We know what works in education: great teachers;
brilliant leadership; rigour in the curriculum; discipline
in the classroom; proper exams. We have been bold in
reforming the education system to deliver these things,
based upon simple, clear principles and values. We
believe that parents and teachers should be empowered
to run their schools independently. We believe that
teaching is a highly skilled profession, and that we need
to attract the best graduates into it. And we believe that
there is no substitute for a rigorous academic curriculum
to secure the best from every pupil.

We inherited a system where far too many children left
school without the qualifications and skills they needed.
One in three children was leaving primary school unable
to read, write and add up properly. The number of pupils
studying the core academic subjects at GCSE had halved.
Our schools had fallen down the global league tables

for maths and science. And the poorest children were
attending the weakest schools.

Our far-reaching education reforms have changed this. We
have brought high standards back to teaching, discipline
back to schools, and challenging subjects back onto the
curriculum. Today, there are a million more pupils in
schools rated by Ofsted as ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’. Over

a thousand schools that were ranked ‘inadequate’ have
become Academies, bringing in new leadership to promote
discipline, rigour and higher standards.

 

There are over 250 new free schools — set up and run by
local people — delivering better education for the children
who need it most. We have boosted the number of
apprenticeships to record levels — 2.2 million over the last
five years — and last September more people headed off to
university than at any time in history. Too many children,
however, are still not receiving the excellent education that
they deserve. So we will continue our reforms, so that every
child has the best possible start in life.

There are a million more pupils
in schools rated by Ofsted as

‘good’ or ‘outstanding’

Our plan of action:

 

We will drive up standards in your child's school

We have made exams more rigorous and ended grade
inflation. There is more to do. We will start by introducing
tough new standards for literacy and numeracy in primary
schools. We will expect every 11-year-old to know their
times tables off by heart and be able to perform long
division and complex multiplication. They should be

able to read a book and write a short story with accurate
punctuation, spelling and grammar. If children do not

33

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

 

reach the required standards in their exams at the end

of primary school, they will resit them at the start of
secondary school, to make sure no pupil is left behind.
We will require secondary school pupils to take GCSEs

in English, maths, science, a language and history or
geography, with Ofsted unable to award its highest ratings
to schools that refuse to teach these core subjects.

We will ensure there is a good primary school
place for your child, with zero tolerance of failure

We have more than doubled Labour's spending on new
school places. But we want to go even further, investing
at least £7 billion over the next Parliament to provide
good school places. And we will let our best headteachers
take control of failing primary schools, by expanding the
National Leaders of Education programme.

Every school needs high
standards, proper funding
and accountability

We will turn every failing and coasting secondary
school into an academy, and deliver free schools
if parents in your area want them

Over 4,000 schools are already benefiting from academy
status, giving them more power over discipline and
budgets. And nearly 800 of the worst-performing
primary schools have been taken over by experienced
academy sponsors with a proven track record of success.
This is improving education for our children. So we

will continue to expand academies, free schools, studio
schools and University Technical Colleges. Over the
next Parliament, we will open at least 500 new free
schools, resulting in 270,000 new school places. And

we will introduce new powers to force coasting schools
to accept new leadership. Any school judged by Ofsted
to be requiring improvement will be taken over by

the best headteachers — backed by expert sponsors

or high-performing neighbouring schools — unless it

can demonstrate that it has a plan to improve rapidly.
We will continue to allow all good schools to expand,
whether they are maintained schools, academies, free
schools or grammar schools.

We will continue to protect school funding

Over the last five years, we have protected the schools budget
and committed £18 billion for new school buildings, so

that children can learn in the best environment possible.
Under a future Conservative Government, the amount of
money following your child into school will be protected.

As the number of pupils increases, so will the amount of
money in our schools. On current pupil number forecasts,
there will be a real-terms increase in the schools budget in
the next Parliament. We will continue to provide the pupil
premium, protected at current rates, so that schools receive
additional money for those from the poorest backgrounds.
We will support families by providing free meals to all
infants. And we will make schools funding fairer. We have
already increased funding for the 69 least well-funded local
authorities in the country, and will make this the baseline for
their funding in the next Parliament. We will not allow state
schools to make a profit.

We will back your child's teachers

We have already given teachers greater disciplinary powers.
In the next Parliament, we will expect every teacher to be
trained not just in how to tackle serious behaviour issues,
but also in how to deal with the low level disruption that
stops children from learning properly. This generation of
teachers is already the best-qualified ever. In future, we will
recruit and keep the best teachers by reducing the time they
spend on paperwork, introducing bursaries for the most
in-demand subjects, paying good teachers more, further
reducing the burden of Ofsted inspections and continuing
to encourage the growth of Teach First. We will increase
the number of teachers able to teach Mandarin in schools
in England, so we can compete in the global race. We want
teachers to be regarded in the same way as other highly
skilled professionals, so we are supporting the creation

of an independent College of Teaching to promote the
highest standards of teaching and school leadership.

We will lead the world in maths and science

We have increased the time schools will spend on maths,
and ensured that children learn to code as soon as they
start school. Maths is now the most popular A-level subject.
We aim to make Britain the best place in the world to study
maths, science and engineering, measured by improved
performance in the PISA league tables. To help achieve
this, we will train an extra 17,500 maths and physics

Schools budget protected with

£5 billion given to tackle
Labour's school places crisis

 

teachers over the next five years. We will make sure that all
students are pushed to achieve their potential and create
more opportunities to stretch the most able.

We will protect children

Every child deserves a warm, loving home, and to feel safe
online and at school. We have made improving support

for children and young people with special educational
needs and disabilities a priority. We have created 2,200
more special schools places through our free schools
programme, introduced a coordinated assessment process
to determine a child or young person’s needs, and funded
degree-level specialist training for teachers and support
staff. And to make sure it’s working, Ofsted now formally
inspects local areas for their effectiveness in fulfilling their
new duties. We have made progress in reforming our
adoption system, but there is more to do. We will introduce
regional adoption agencies, working across local authority
boundaries to match children with the best parents for
them. We will continue to raise the quality of children’s
social work, by expanding training programmes, such as
Frontline, and creating new opportunities to develop the
next generation of leaders in the field. We will continue to
tackle all forms of bullying in our schools. And we will stop
children's exposure to harmful sexualised content online, by
requiring age verification for access to all sites containing
pornographic material and age-rating for all music videos.

We will improve skills training

We have given employers much more control over
apprenticeship courses, so they teach skills relevant to
the workplace. We will continue to replace lower-level,
classroom-based Further Education courses with high-
quality apprenticeships that combine training with
experience of work and a wage. We will ensure there is a

Child poverty is down - with
300,000 fewer children living in

University Technical College within reach of every city. We
will abolish employers! National Insurance contributions
on earnings up to the upper earnings limit for apprentices
under the age of 25. And we will roll out many more
Degree Apprenticeships, allowing young people to combine
a world-class degree with a world-class apprenticeship.

We will improve Further Education

We will continue to improve Further Education through
our network of National Colleges, which will provide
specialist higher-level vocational training in sectors critical
to economic growth. We will publish more earnings and
destination data for Further Education courses, and require
more accreditation of courses by employers.

We will ensure that if you want to go to university,
you can

This year, for the first time, over half a million people

have been admitted to our universities, including a record
proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
From September, we will go even further, abolishing the

cap on higher education student numbers and removing

an arbitrary ceiling on ambition. Our reforms to university
funding mean you do not have to pay anything towards
tuition while studying, and only start paying back if you earn
over £21,000 per year. We will ensure the continuing success
and stability of these reforms, so that the interests of both
students and taxpayers are fairly represented. We will also
introduce a national postgraduate loan system for taught
masters and PhD courses. We will ensure that universities
deliver the best possible value for money to students: we

will introduce a framework to recognise universities offering
the highest teaching quality; encourage universities to

offer more two-year courses; and require more data to be
openly available to potential students so that they can make
decisions informed by the career paths of past graduates.

We will ensure that our universities remain
world-leading

We will maintain our universities’ reputation for world-class
research and academic excellence. Through the Nurse
Review of research councils, we will seek to ensure that the
UK continues to support world-leading science, and invests
public money in the best possible way. And we will encourage
the development of online education as a tool for students,
whether studying independently or in our universities.

Protecting and improving our

National Health Service

 

Our commitment to you:

Our National Health Service must be there for you throughout your life. We will:

= continue to increase spending on the NHS, supported by a strong economy, so the NHS

stays free for you to use

m spend at least an additional £8 billion by 2020 over and above inflation to fund and
support the NHS’s own action plan for the next five years

m ensure you can see a GP and receive the hospital care you need, 7 days a week by 2020, with
a guarantee that everyone over 75 will get a same-day appointment if they need one

a integrate health and social care, through our Better Care Fund

a lead the world in fighting cancer and finding a cure for dementia

 

The NHS is vitally important to all of us. Founded on
the principle that no one should ever have to worry about
their ability to pay for their healthcare, it is a profound
expression of our values as a nation.

Patients, doctors and nurses are the experts on how

to improve people’s health. So we have given greater
power and accountability to the frontline than any other
government. We cleared out bureaucracy, generating
savings which we have invested in care for patients.
Instead of chasing managerial targets, we have focused on
outcomes and performance. And we have given patients
more power by providing them with more information.

Under Labour, micro-management from Whitehall
clogged-up the system. A cover-up culture developed,
where doctors and nurses were scared to speak out about
the appalling standards of care at hospitals in places such
as Stafford and Morecambe Bay. By the time Labour left
office, our cancer survival rates lagged far behind those of
other countries, and more than 18,000 patients had been
waiting for over a year to start their treatment.

We are building an NHS that is
more efficient, more effective
and more accountable

We are putting things right. We protected the NHS budget.
Our doctors and nurses are now doing over a million
more operations each year than in 2010. Our Cancer
Drugs Fund has given more than 60,000 people access to
life-saving drugs. We have doubled funding for dementia
research. Hospital infections have halved. An independent
think tank, the Commonwealth Fund, has found that
under the Conservatives the NHS has become the best
healthcare system of any major country. And patients are
reporting the highest levels of satisfaction for years. The
NHS is performing well in the face of increasing demand,
with fewer patients waiting longer than the 18, 26 and

52 week targets than in May 2010. We have slashed the
number of people who wait over a year for the treatment
they need, from over 18,000 to under 500.

Despite this progress, our NHS faces major challenges.

An ageing population will place more pressure on health
and social care, and life-saving but expensive new drugs
will push up costs. And for years it’s been too hard to
access the NHS out of hours, even though sudden illness
and events which you and your family cannot plan for do
not respect normal working hours. We will rise to these
challenges. By building a strong economy, we will be able
to increase spending in real terms every year. With a future
Conservative Government, you will have a truly 7-day
NHS, at the frontier of science, offering you new drugs and
treatments, safeguarded for years to come.

Our plan of action:

We will deliver a strong NHS through a strong
economy

We are set to increase health spending by more than £7
billion above and beyond inflation in the five years since
2010. And we will continue spend more on the NHS, in
real terms, every year. The NHS is more efficient now
than it has ever been. We will implement the NHS’s own
plan to improve health care even further — the Five Year
Forward View. Because of our long-term economic plan,
we are able to commit to increasing NHS spending in
England in real terms by a minimum of £8 billion over
the next five years. Combined with the efficiencies that the
NHS Forward View sets out, this will provide the funding
necessary to implement this plan in full.

We are prioritising resources
to frontline services - with 9,500

more doctors and 6,900 more
MOLES

We will make the NHS more convenient
for you

We want England to be the first nation in the world to
provide a truly 7 day NHS. Already millions more people
can see a GP 7 days a week, from 8am-8pm, but by 2020 we
want this for everyone. We will now go further, with hospitals
properly staffed, so that the quality of care is the same

every day of the week. We will restore your right to access a
specific, named GP — something that Labour abolished. We
will ensure that your family doctor appointments and repeat
prescriptions are routinely available online, wherever you
live. And we will guarantee same-day GP appointments for
all over 75s who need them.

We will offer you the safest and most
compassionate care in the world

We will ensure that English hospitals and GP surgeries
are the safest in the world, places where you are treated
with dignity and respect. We will continue to eliminate
mixed-sex wards and hospital infections. We will ensure

 

We have increased the NHS

budget above inflation every year

 

that the NHS is accountable when mistakes are made, and
implement the recommendations of the independent review
into the Stafford Hospital scandal. We will ensure that the
independent Care Quality Gommission rates all hospitals,
care homes and GP surgeries. We introduced expert Chief
Inspectors to promote excellence and root out poor care, and
we will continue to back them. We are deeply proud of our
NHS staff, who are the best in the world. Over the last five
years, we have hired thousands more doctors and nurses. We
will continue to ensure that we have enough doctors, nurses
and other staff to meet patients’ needs, and consider how
best to recognise and reward high performance.

We will help you make informed choices about
your healthcare

We will improve standards in all areas of care. In 2013
we introduced the friends and family test so you could
provide feedback on the care and treatment you received;
we aim to increase the proportion of people who rate
their experience as ‘excellent’ or ‘very good’. We will boost
transparency even further, ensuring you can access full
information about the safety record of your hospital and
other NHS or independent providers, and give patients
greater choice over where and how they receive care. We
will give you full access to your own electronic health
records, while retaining your right to opt-out of your
records being shared electronically.

We will support you and your family to stay
healthy

We are helping people to stay healthy by ending the open
display of tobacco in shops, introducing plain~packaged
cigarettes and funding local authority public health budgets.
We will take action to reduce childhood obesity and continue
to promote clear food information. We will support people
struggling with addictions and undertake a review into how

People deserve

not more bureaucracy

 

38

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

 

best to support those suffering from long-term yet treatable
conditions, such as drug or alcohol addiction, or obesity,
back in to work. We will be the first country to implement a
national, evidence-based diabetes prevention programme.
And we will invest more in primary care, to help prevent
health problems before they start.

We will ensure you receive the best healthcare

We will speed up your access to new medicines by
implementing the findings of our Innovative Medicines
and Medical Technology Review. We will increase the

use of cost-effective new medicines and technologies, and
encourage large-scale trials of innovative technologies and
health services. Antibiotic resistance is a major health risk
so we will continue to lead the global fight against it, taking
forward the recommendations of the independent review
launched by the Prime Minister, David Cameron, And
we will support our long-term economic plan by fostering
research, innovation and jobs in the life science industry.

We will help if you or your loved ones are
affected by cancer

Cancer survival rates are improving, and are now the best
they have ever been. We will continue to invest in our life-
saving Cancer Drugs Fund. We will work with the NHS,
charities and patient groups to deliver the new strategy
recommended by NHS England’s cancer taskforce.

This will improve survival rates and save thousands of
lives through enhanced prevention, earlier detection

and diagnosis, and better treatment and care. We will
continue to support research to improve the diagnosis and
treatment of rare diseases and cancers, including through

Over 60,000 people have
benefited from the Cancer

Drugs Fund

 

decoding 100,000 whole genomes. ‘This will help scientists
and doctors understand diseases better, and design more
effective, personalised treatments.

We will continue to take your mental health as
seriously as your physical health

We have legislated to ensure that mental and physical
health conditions are given equal priority. We will now
go further, ensuring that there are therapists in every
part of the country providing treatment for those who
need it. We are increasing funding for mental health
care. We will enforce the new access and waiting time
standards for people experiencing mental ill-health,
including children and young people. Building on our
success in training thousands of nurses and midwives
to become health visitors, we will ensure that women
have access to mental health support during and after
pregnancy, while strengthening the health visiting
programme for new mothers.

We will ensure that people can grow old in
comfort and dignity

We have led the world on fighting dementia, and will
deliver our strategy — the Prime Minister’s Challenge on
Dementia 2020 — making sure that everyone diagnosed
with the condition gets a meaningful care plan to support
them and their family. We will increase support for full-
time unpaid carers. We will guarantee that you will not
have to sell your home to fund your residential social care.
‘Too many people spend their last days in hospital when
they would prefer to die closer to home; we will support
commissioners to combine better health and social care
services for the terminally ill so that more people are able to
die in a place of their choice. We will continue to integrate
the health and social care systems, joining-up services
between homes, clinics and hospitals, including through
piloting new approaches like the pooling of around

£6 billion of health and social care funding in Greater
Manchester and the £5.3 billion Better Care Fund.

Enabling you to enjoy our heritage,

creativity and sports

 

Our commitment to you:

Wherever you live in the country, we want you to be able to enjoy the best our culture and

sports have to offer. We will:

a keep our major national museums and galleries free to enter

m= support school sport, build on our Olympic and Paralympic legacy, and deliver the Rugby
and Cricket World Cups and the World Athletics Championships

u freeze the BBC licence fee, to save you money

m support our creative industries and defend a free media

 

One of the highlights of the past five years was the
London Olympic and Paralympic Games. Those weeks
in 2012 demonstrated the best of our country. When the
pressure is on, we deliver; when the stakes are high, we
come together; when it comes to taking on the world, we

can win.

We may not be the biggest country, but our museums
are second to none. In music, art, fashion, theatre,
design, film, television and the performing arts, we
have an edge. Conservatives understand these things
do not just enhance our national prestige and boost
our economy; they help tie our country together,
strengthening the bonds between all of us.

That’s why, despite all the economic chaos we inherited,
we have put over £8 billion of public and Lottery
funding into the arts, heritage, museums and galleries
during the last five years. We have also boosted school
sports and increased the share of National Lottery
funding going to good causes.

Culture and sport help
bring us closer together as
a nation, strengthening the
bonds between all of us

Our plan of action:

We will support our world-leading museums,
galleries and heritage

We will keep our major national museums and galleries
free to enter and enable our cultural institutions to benefit
from greater financial autonomy to use their budgets as
they see fit. Over the last five years, we have made sure that
arts funding benefits the whole of the UK. We will support
a Great Exhibition in the North; back plans for a new
theatre, The Factory, Manchester; and help the Manchester
Museum, in partnership with the British Museum, to
establish a new India Gallery. We are also supporting plans
to develop a modern world class concert hall for London.
We will ensure the protection and enjoyment of one

our most ancient and precious heritage sites by building

a tunnel where the A303 passes closest to Stonehenge.

We significantly increased National Lottery funding for
heritage and have created a brand new heritage charity —
English Heritage — to support more than 400 buildings and
monuments. And we will continue to support essential roof
repairs for our cathedrals and churches, along with other
places of worship.

We will continue to support local libraries

We will help public libraries to support local
communities by providing free wi-fi. And we will assist
them in embracing the digital age by working with them

to ensure remote access to e-books, without charge
and with appropriate compensation for authors that
enhances the Public Lending Right scheme.

We will support our media

A free media is the bedrock of an open society. We

will deliver a comprehensive review of the BBC Royal
Charter, ensuring it delivers value for money for the
licence fee payer, while maintaining a world class service
and supporting our creative industries. That is why

we froze the BBC licence fee and will keep it frozen,
pending Charter renewal. And we will continue to ‘top-
slice’ the licence fee for digital infrastructure to support
superfast broadband across the country.

We will defend press freedom

We will continue to defend hard-won liberties and the
operation of a free press. But alongside the media’s
rights comes a clear responsibility, which is why we set
up the public, judge-led Leveson Inquiry in response

to the phone-hacking scandal, created a new watchdog
by Royal Charter and legislated to toughen media libel
laws. Because the work of the free press is so important
we will offer explicit protection for the role of journalists
via the British Bill of Rights and we will ban the police
from accessing journalists’ phone records to identify
whistle-blowers and other sources without prior judicial
approval. Local newspapers are an important source of
information for local communities and a vital part of a
healthy democracy. ‘To support them as they adapt to
new technology and changing circumstances, we will
consult on the introduction of a business rates relief for
local newspapers in England.

We will support our creative industries

The creative industries have become our fastest-growing
economic sector, contributing nearly £77 billion to the
UK economy ~ driven in part by the tax incentives for
films, theatre, video games, animation and orchestras
we introduced. Our support for the film industry

has resulted in great British films and encouraged
Hollywood’s finest to flock to the UK. We will continue
these reliefs, with a tax credit for children’s television
next year, and expand them when possible. We will
protect intellectual property by continuing to require
internet service providers to block sites that carry large

amounts of illegal content, including their proxies. And
we will build on progress made under our voluntary
anti-piracy projects to warn internet users when they are
breaching copyright. We will work to ensure that search
engines do not link to the worst-offending sites.

We will continue to support tourism
in our country

Our tourism industry already supports three million jobs
and is one of the nation’s leading employers and export
earners. We will set challenging targets for Visit Britain
and Visit England to ensure more visitors travel outside
the capital. We will simplify and speed up visa issuance
for tourists. And because tourism is an industry that
depends more than most on young people, we will step
up efforts to recruit more apprentices into the business.

We will build on our Olympic and
Paralympic legacy

We want our sportsmen and women to win even more
medals in Rio 2016 than they did in London 2012. So
we will continue to support elite sports funding as part
of our Olympic and Paralympic legacy. We will deliver
the Rugby World Cup in 2015, the World Athletics
Championship in 2017, IPC World Championships in
2017 and the Cricket World Cup in 2019, maximising
the opportunities for tourism and jobs. We will support
new sports in the UK, in particular through greater links
with the US National Football League, the National
Basketball Association and Major League Baseball, with
the ultimate ambition of new franchises being based here.

We will boost sport in your community

We have already boosted funding for sport in primary
schools and over 18,000 schools have registered to

take part in our School Games. We will go further,
supporting primary school sport with £150 million a
year, paid directly to head-teachers, until 2020. This will
make sure that all primary schoolchildren benefit from

School Games supported with
over £150 million of National

Lottery and public money

a minimum of two hours high-class sport and PE each
week. We will improve the quality of Community Sports
facilities, working with local authorities, the Football
Association and the Premier League to fund investment
in artificial football pitches in more than 30 cities across
England. We will continue to invest in participation
and physical activity, recognising sport’s vital benefits

to health and to NHS England’s campaign to prevent
diabetes. We will lift the number of women on national
sports governing bodies to at least 25 per cent by 2017,
and seek to increase participation in sport by women
and girls.

Helping you build the Big Society

 

Our commitment to you:

Building the Big Society is about involving the people, neighbourhoods, villages, towns and cities
of Britain in the great task of improving our country - and giving young people the power and
opportunity to play a real part in their community. We will:

mu guarantee your child a place on National Citizen Service, so they can learn new skills and
meet young people from different walks of life

= promote equal treatment and equal opportunity for all in a society proud of its tolerance

and diversity

m give those who work for a big company and the public sector a new workplace entitlement
to Volunteering Leave for three days a year, on full pay.

The Big Society is a vision of a more engaged nation, one
in which we take more responsibility for ourselves and our
neighbours; communities working together, not depending
on remote and impersonal bureaucracies. Of course, there
are many tasks which require the resources and grip of
government. But there are also many areas of national

life in which we need more people to step forward, take
responsibility and play their part. This is about a national
culture change, saying to everyone in Britain: ask what you
can do for your community and your country.

Volunteering is at a 10-year
high, with 3 million more adults

giving their time last year than
in 2010

 

In the past five years, there has been real progress.
Volunteering is now at a ten-year high, with over three
million more adults giving their time last year than in
the year to March 2010. Charitable donations are on the
up, with one million more people giving to good causes
than at the end of the last Parliament. There are now
parents’ groups and charities running their own free
schools. There are social enterprises helping people into
jobs through the Work Programme. We have launched
the world’s first social investment bank, introduced more
social impact bonds than the rest of the world combined

and highlighted the great work done in communities
with the Big Society Awards and the Prime Minister’s
Points of Light award.

A generation of teenagers has undertaken National
Citizen Service (NCS), developing their skills, broadening
their horizons and growing in confidence; over the next
five years, we will expand NCS ~ so it becomes a rite of
passage for young people in our country. We will give
more people the power and support to run a school, start
their own social enterprise, and take over their own local
parks, landmarks and pubs. We will encourage the 1,400
communities engaged in neighbourhood planning to
complete the process and assist others to draw up their
own plans. And we will take new steps to encourage
volunteering, enabling more people to join the unsung
heroes who are the backbone of communities across
Britain.

 

Our plan of action:

We will expand National Citizen Service

Over 130,000 young people have graduated from NCS
and we have now guaranteed a place on NCS for every
16 and 17-year-old who wants one. In addition to this,
we will increase the number of cadet units in schools, so
that more students have the chance to learn skills such as
leadership and self-reliance.

We will innovate in how we deliver public
services

We have pioneered ways to deliver high-quality public
services, including through getting the voluntary sector
more involved. For example, our Work Programme has
helped harness the talent and energy of charities to help
people turn their lives around and find their way back

into work. We will examine ways to build on this type of
innovative approach in the future. We have also pioneered
the use of social impact bonds and payment-by-results,
and we will look to scale these up in the future, focusing on
youth unemployment, mental health and homelessness.

We will help you volunteer and support action
to help the vulnerable

We will support the Prince of Wales’ Step Up To Serve
initiative, encouraging young people to serve in their
community. And we will make volunteering for three
days a year a workplace entitlement for people working in
large companies and the public sector. People could, for
example, volunteer for a local charity or serve as a school

Over 130,000 young people
have taken part in National

Citizen Service

 

governor. We have always believed that churches, faith
groups and other voluntary groups play an important and
longstanding role in this country’s social fabric, running
foodbanks, helping the homeless, and tackling debt and
addictions, such as alcoholism and gambling. We have
already introduced tougher regulation of gambling, with
enhanced player protections and planning controls to
prevent the further proliferation of high street betting
shops; we've capped payday lending and backed financial
inclusion; and will continue to support action that helps
vulnerable people get the assistance they need.

We will champion equal rights and correct
past wrongs

Our historic introduction of gay marriage has helped
drive forward equality and strengthened the institution
of marriage. But there is still more to do, and we

will continue to champion equality for Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual and Transgender people. We will build on the
posthumous pardon of Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing,
who committed suicide following his conviction for gross
indecency, with a broader measure to lift the blight of
outdated convictions of this nature. ‘Thousands of British
men still suffer from similar historic charges, even though
they would be completely innocent of any crime today.
Many others are dead and cannot correct this injustice
themselves through the legal process we have introduced
while in government. So we will introduce a new law that
will pardon those people, and right these wrongs.

Making government work better for you

 

Our commitment to you:

The government is the servant of the British people. Every pound spent must be scrutinised, and
government run as efficiently and effectively as possible. We will:

m save you money by cutting government waste

mu put more of the essential services you use online, to make them more convenient

= continue to make government more transparent, so you can hold us to account for how

your money is being spent.

 

Government is the servant of the British people, not
their master. That simple fact was forgotten when
Labour was in power. Quangos grew in number,
wasteful projects proliferated and the bureaucracy
swelled — symptoms of a Government that believed it
always knew best.

Hardworking taxpayers
deserve a government
that is more efficient and
accountable

Conservatives have brought in a new approach. We
are determined to measure success not by how much
money is spent, but how much it improves people’s
lives. Whitehall is now leaner and smaller than at any
time since the Second World War. We have halved
the running costs of the Department for Education.
We have abolished or merged over 300 quangos. We
have moved paperwork online. We have shone a bright
light on government spending — requiring all central
government spending over £25,000 to be published
online. We have also ensured that people receive a
transparent breakdown of how their taxes are spent.

In the next five years, we will ensure this efficiency
revolution continues. We will also continue to reform our
political system: make votes of more equal value through
long overdue boundary reforms, reducing the number of
MPs and ensuring the Electoral Commission does more

£14.3 billion was saved in
2014 through efficiencies in
government - equivalent to

nearly £850 for every working
household

 

to tackle voting fraud. These measures will help to restore
public confidence in British politics.

Our plan of action:

We will cut government waste

We have reduced the cost of government, by selling
empty buildings, managing big projects better, shrinking
the Civil Service, reforming pensions, moving more
services online, and improving contracting. We plan a
further £10 billion annual savings by 2017-18 and £15-
20 billion in 2019-20.

To eliminate the deficit, we
must continue to cut out
wasteful spending

We will deliver better public services and more
open government

We have supported the growth of public service mutuals —
organisations that are owned by their staff and deliver public
services. We want more of them, so we will guarantee a
‘right to mutualise’ within the public sector. This will free up
the entrepreneurial spirit of public servants and yield better
value for money for taxpayers. ‘Transparency has also been
at the heart of our approach to government. Over the last
five years, we have been open about government spending,
provided access to taxpayer-funded research, pursued

open data and helped establish the Open Government
Partnership. We will continue to be the most transparent
government in the world. We addressed public concern
about the influence of money on politics, with a law that
strengthened rules governing non-party campaigning

and established a register of consultant lobbyists. In the
next Parliament, we will legislate to ensure trade unions

use a transparent opt-in process for subscriptions to

political parties. We will continue to seek agreement on a
comprehensive package of party funding reform.

We will make government more efficient

We value our outstanding public servants. Over the last five
years, we have made efficiencies in government. We have
ruled out the introduction of regional pay in the public
sector, which we do not support and will not introduce.
Britain's impartial, professional and highly capable Civil
Service is admired around the world and one of our nation's
strengths. We will push ahead with reform of the Civil
Service to make it more dynamic and streamlined. We

will make recruitment to the Civil Service more open and
actively look for exceptional talent, especially in areas where
capabilities are in short supply. We will continue to tackle

all the bureaucracy of Whitehall that clogs the arteries of
government. We will end taxpayer-funded six-figure payofls
for the best paid public sector workers. We will continue to
sell unneeded government property and co-locate services
wherever possible. We have already created 20 high-quality
digital services, which include apprenticeships applications
and tax self-assessments. We will save you time, hassle and
money by moving more services online, while actively
tackling digital exclusion. We will ensure digital assistance is
always available for those who are not online, while rolling
out cross-government technology platforms to cut costs and
improve productivity — such as GOV.UK.

We will reform Parliament

We have improved the operation of Parliament,
strengthening its ability to hold the Government to account,
with reforms such as the election of Select Committee chairs
and the creation of the Backbench Business Committee,
which enables backbenchers, for the first time, to determine
a significant proportion of the House of Commons’
business. We have also passed the Fixed Term Parliament
Act, an unprecedented transfer of Executive power. In

the next Parliament, we will address the unfairness of the
current Parliamentary boundaries, reduce the number

of MPs to 600 to cut the cost of politics and make votes

of more equal value. We will implement the boundary
reforms that Parliament has already approved and make
them apply automatically once the Boundary Commission
reports in 2018. This will deal with the fact that the current
electoral layout over-represents parts of the country where
populations have been falling and under-represents parts
where populations have been rising.

We will ensure that the House of Lords fulfils
its valuable role as a chamber of legislative
scrutiny and revision

While we still see a strong case for introducing an elected
element into our second chamber, this is not a priority in

the next Parliament. We have already allowed for expulsion
of members for poor conduct and will ensure the House of
Lords continues to work well by addressing issues such as the
size of the chamber and the retirement of peers.

We will protect our electoral system, to
safeguard our democracy

Building on our introduction of individual voter
registration, we will continue to make our arrangements
fair and effective by ensuring the Electoral Commission
puts greater priority on tackling fraud and considers
insisting on proof of ID to vote. We will complete the
electoral register, by working to include more of the five
million Britons who live abroad. We will introduce votes for
life, scrapping the rule that bars British citizens who have
lived abroad for more than 15 years from voting. We will
respect the will of the British people, as expressed in the
2011 referendum, and keep First Past the Post for elections
to the House of Commons. And we will introduce English
votes for English laws, answering the longstanding West
Lothian Question in our democracy.

Helping you to buy a home of your own

 

Our commitment to you:

The chance to own your own home should be available to everyone who works hard. We will:

a help to keep mortgage rates lower by continuing to work through our long-term

economic plan

a build more homes that people can afford, including 200,000 new Starter Homes exclusively

for first-time buyers under 40

u extend the Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme to 2020 to help more people onto and up the
housing ladder, and introduce a new Help to Buy ISA to support people saving for a deposit

m give more people the chance to own their home by extending the Right to Buy to tenants of
Housing Associations and create a Brownfield Fund to unlock homes on brownfield land

a ensure local people have more control over planning and protect the Green Belt

 

Conservatives believe passionately in home ownership.
We understand how good it feels when you have worked
long hours, saved money for years, and finally take
possession of the keys to your first home. For years,
however, people have been finding it harder and harder
to get on the housing ladder. Under Labour, house-
building fell to its lowest peacetime level since the

1920s. Developers were building too few homes and

the aftermath of the banking crisis saw young people
struggling to raise a deposit.

House building at its highest

since 2007

 

These past five years have been about reversing this
trend. We have unblocked the planning system, to help
builders start building again. We have introduced Help
to Buy, making it much easier for people to secure a
mortgage. And we have reinvigorated the Right to Buy
which Labour had cut back, extending home ownership
to a whole new generation of social tenants. As a result,
over 200,000 people have been helped either on or up
the housing ladder. Most of those helped have been
young first-time buyers spread right across our country.

Everyone who works hard
should be able to owna
home of their own

As the party of home ownership, we want to go further
and faster — and this manifesto sets out our plan. At its
heart, a clear objective to build affordable homes, including
200,000 Starter Homes which will be sold at a 20 per cent
discount, and will be built exclusively for first time buyers
under the age of 40. At the same time, we will extend our
Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme, introduce a new Help to
Buy ISA, extend the Right to Buy to Housing Association
tenants and make sure that, when it comes to planning
decisions, local people are in charge.

And for all those already in their home, we will make
sure we continue working through our economic plan,
so mortgage rates stay lower for longer and people
can keep hold of their homes and plan for the future

~— safe in the knowledge they have a government that is
competently looking after the public finances so they
can look after their own.

We will continue to work
through our plan, so
mortgage rates stay lower
for longer

Our plan of action:

We will double the number of first-time
buyers, and help more people own their
own home

We are setting an ambition to double the number of
first-time buyers compared to the last five years — helping
one million more people to own their own home. We will
extend Help to Buy to cover another 120,000 homes — in
total helping over 200,000 people and we will continue
the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee until the start of
2017, and the Help to Buy equity loan until at least 2020.
From this autumn, we will introduce a new Help to Buy
ISA to support people who are working hard to save up
for a deposit for their first home. A ten per cent deposit
on the average first home costs £15,000, so if you put

in up to £12,000, government will put in up to £3,000
more. A 25 per cent top-up is equivalent to saving a
deposit from your pre-tax income — making it effectively a
tax cut for first-time buyers.

Our new Help to Buy ISA
will support people who are

working hard to save for a
deposit

We will build 200,000 Starter Homes and
more affordable housing

We will build 200,000 quality Starter Homes over the
course of the next Parliament, reserved for first-time
buyers under 40 and sold at 20 per cent below the market
price. We have delivered over 217,000 new affordable
homes since 2010. We will now go further, delivering
275,000 additional affordable homes by 2020. And we
will offer 10,000 new homes to rent at below market rates,

 

to help people save for a deposit.

We will extend the Right to Buy to tenants in
Housing Associations

We will extend the Right to Buy to tenants in Housing
Associations to enable more people to buy a home of
their own. It is unfair that they should miss out on a
right enjoyed by tenants in local authority homes. We
will fund the replacement of properties sold under the
extended Right to Buy by requiring local authorities to
manage their housing assets more efficiently, with the
most expensive properties sold off and replaced as they
fall vacant. We will also create a Brownfield Fund to
unlock homes on brownfield land for additional housing.

We will give you the Right to Build

We aim at least to double the number of custom-built
and self-built homes by 2020, and we will take forward
a new Right to Build, requiring councils to allocate land
to local people to build or commission their own home,
as you can do in most of Europe.

We will protect the Green Belt

We have safeguarded national Green Belt protection
and increased protection of important green spaces.
We have abolished the Labour Government’s top-down
Regional Strategies which sought to delete the Green
Belt in and around 30 towns and cities and introduced
a new Local Green Space planning designation which
allows councils and neighbourhood plans to give added
protection to valuable local green spaces.

We will support locally-led garden cities and
towns and prioritise brownfield development,
making sure new homes are always matched by
the necessary infrastructure to support them

We will support locally-led garden cities and towns in
places where communities want them, such as Ebbsfleet
and Bicester. When new homes are granted planning
permission, we will make sure local communities

know up-front that necessary infrastructure such as
schools and roads will be provided. We will ensure that
brownfield land is used as much as possible for new
development. We will require local authorities to have a
register of what is available, and ensure that 90 per cent

 

52

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

 

of suitable brownfield sites have planning permission for
housing by 2020. To meet the capital’s housing needs,
we will create a new London Land Commission, with a
mandate to identify and release all surplus brownfield
land owned by the public sector. We will fund Housing
Zones to transform brownfield sites into new housing,
which will create 95,000 new homes.

Average council tax bills in
England have fallen, in real

terms, by 11 per cent

 

We will help keep your council taxes low

Under this Government, average council tax bills in
England have fallen, in real terms, by 11 per cent.
Whereas Labour wants to propose a new tax on family
homes, we will help local authorities keep council tax
low for hardworking taxpayers, and ensure residents
can continue to veto high rises via a local referendum.
And in London, where there is a Conservative Mayor,
bills have fallen even further. We will continue to work
with councillors to deliver high quality, value for money
services. We will encourage voluntary integration of
services and administration between and within councils —

for example, with the Troubled Families Programme and
the Better Care Fund — to promote savings and improve
local services. We want local councils to help manage
public land and buildings, and will give them at least a 10
per cent stake in public sector land sales in their area.

We will help you build a strong local economy

We want local authorities to help create strong local
economies. Building on the local retention of business
rates introduced in 2012, we will promote localism by
allowing councils to keep a higher proportion of the
business rates revenue that is generated in their area.
This will provide a strong financial incentive for councils
to promote economic growth. We will review how we
can further reduce ring-fencing and remove Whitehall
burdens to give councils more flexibility to support

local services. We will support Business Improvement
Districts and other forms of business-led collaboration
on high streets — giving more say to local traders on
issues such as minor planning applications, cleaning and
parking. We will continue to support local shops and
residents in tackling aggressive parking enforcement and
excessive parking charges, and take steps to tackle rogue
and unfair practices by private parking operators. Our
Coastal Communities Fund will help our seaside areas
thrive, helping to boost skills and create jobs.

Protecting and enhancing our natural environment

 

Our commitment to you:

We set ourselves the goal of being the first generation to leave the natural environment of
England in a better state than that in which we found it. This is a big ambition to which we

remain committed. We will:

m putin place a new ‘Blue Belt’ to protect precious marine habitats

a invest in cleaner air and water for you and your family

a keep our forests in trust for the nation

 

For Conservatives, Britain’s ‘green and pleasant land’
is not some relic from a bygone era, to be mourned
and missed: it’s the living, breathing backdrop to our
national life. Our moors and meadows, wildlife and
nature, air and water are a crucial part of our national
identity and make our country what it is. So we care
about them deeply, want to protect them for everyone
and pass them onto future generations.

Labour never understood this. Our rural communities
fell further behind urban areas; biodiversity suffered,
with important species and habitats declining under
their watch; and they failed to protect the Green Belt.

Over the last five years, we have committed billions of
pounds to reduce emissions from transport and clean up
our rivers and seas. We have done more to protect our
seas, safeguarded our Green Belt and planted 11 million
trees. And we set out a comprehensive, long-term vision
to protect our natural heritage in this country’s first
White Paper on the Natural Environment for 20 years.

Over the next five years, we will put in place stronger
protections for our natural landscapes, establish a new
Blue Belt to safeguard precious marine habitats, launch
a programme of pocket parks in towns and cities and
continue to lead in tackling the illegal wildlife trade.
Our plan is to conserve and enhance our natural
environment so that this remains the most beautiful
country in the world.

Our plan of action:

We will protect your countryside, Green Belt
and urban environment

We will spend £3 billion from the Common Agricultural
Policy to enhance England’s countryside over the next five
years, enabling us, among other things, to clean up our
rivers and lakes, protect our stonewalls and hedges, and help
our bees to thrive. We will ensure that our public forests

and woodland are kept in trust for the nation and plant
another 11 million trees. We will make it easier to access our
beautiful landscapes, by providing free, comprehensive maps
of all open-access green space. Building on our introduction
of a five pence charge on single-use plastic bags, we will
review the case for higher Fixed Penalty Notices for littering
and allow councils to tackle small-scale fly-tipping through
Fixed Penalties rather than costly prosecutions. We will
launch an ambitious programme of pocket parks — small
areas of inviting public space where people can enjoy relief
from the hustle and bustle of city streets. We will protect the
Green Belt, and maintain national protections for Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty, National Parks, Sites of Special
Scientific Interest and other environmental designations.

We will help you enjoy cleaner air and water

We will continue to do even more to tackle air pollution
and clean up our rivers and waterways, including
supporting the Thames Tideway Tunnel. We have
spent over £3 billion on improving flood defences, and
capped the cost of flood insurance. We will now go
further, building 1,400 new flood defence schemes, to
protect 300,000 homes.

We will build new infrastructure in an
environmentally-sensitive way

We will build new roads and railways in a way that limits,
as far as possible, their impact on the environment. This
includes investing £300 million in cutting light pollution
from new roads, doing more tunnelling, building better
noise barriers and helping to restore lost habitat. We

will also replace locally any biodiversity lost in the
construction of High Speed 2. We set up the Natural
Capital Committee to put hard economic numbers on the
value of our environment, and we will extend its life to at
least the end of the next Parliament. We will work with it
to develop a 25 Year Plan to restore the UK’s biodiversity,
and to ensure that both public and private investment in
the environment is directed where we need it most.

We want to protect our
environment for future
generations

We will create a ‘Blue Belt’ to protect precious
marine habitats

Earlier this year, we announced the creation of a new
Marine Protected Area around the Pitcairn Islands — the
largest protected expanse of sea in the world. We will

now go even further, creating a Blue Belt around the

UR’s 14 Overseas Territories, subject to local support and
environmental need. We will designate a further protected
area at Ascension Island, subject to the views of the local
community. And, off our own coasts, we will complete

the network of Marine Conservation Zones that we have
already started, to create a UK Blue Belt of protected sites.

We will protect animal welfare

The quality of the food on your plate, and the economic
security of our farmers, depend on us upholding the
highest standards of animal welfare. We will push for

high animal welfare standards to be incorporated into
international trade agreements and into reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy. We will ban wild animals
in circuses and press for all EU member states to ensure
that animals are only sent to slaughterhouses that

meet high welfare standards. We will encourage other
countries to follow the EU’s lead in banning animal
testing for cosmetics and work to accelerate the global
development and take-up of alternatives to animal
testing where appropriate. We want people to integrate
fully into British society, but that does not mean they
should have to give up the things they hold dear in their
religion. So while we will always make sure the Food
Standards Agency properly regulates the slaughter

of livestock and poultry, we will protect methods of
religious slaughter, such as shechita and halal.

A record investment in Britain’s

flood defences - over £3 billion

 

We will tackle international wildlife trade

As hosts of the London Conference on the Illegal Wildlife
Trade, we helped secure the adoption of the London
Declaration on Illegal Wildlife Trade and will continue
to lead the world in stopping the poaching that kills
thousands of rhinos, elephants and tigers each year. We
will oppose any resumption of commercial whaling, and
seek further measures at the EU and internationally to
end shark-finning. We will promote effective worldwide
measures for tuna conservation, press for a total ban on
ivory sales, and support the Indian Government in its
efforts to protect the Asian elephant. We will press for
full “endangered species’ status for polar bears and a ban
on the international trade in polar bear skins, as well as
for greater attention to be paid to the impact of climate
change on wildlife and habitats in Polar Regions in the
Arctic Council and other international fora.

Guaranteeing you clean, affordable and

secure energy supplies

 

Our commitment to you:

Affordable, reliable energy is critical to our economy, to our national security, and to family

budgets. We will:

a keep your bills as low as possible and promote competition in the energy market

m ensure your homes and businesses have energy supplies they can rely on

a help you insulate your home

a halt the spread of subsidised onshore wind farms
m= meet our climate change commitments, cutting carbon emissions as cheaply as possible,

to save you money

 

Without secure energy supplies, we leave British families
and business at the mercy of fluctuating global oil and
gas prices; we increase our dependence on foreign
sources of energy; and we become less safe and less
prosperous as a result.

National energy policy demands a willingness to take
decisions today for the good of tomorrow. But Labour
took the opposite approach. Power margins ~ the safety
cushion we need to prevent blackouts — have fallen to
record lows because of their historic failure to invest

in new capacity. Domestic sources of oil and gas were
unexploited. And Labour failed to deliver the next
generation of energy projects that will help us keep the
lights on, drive bills down and reduce carbon emissions.

All this hurt consumers. The number of major energy
suppliers halved and energy bills soared, with the
average gas bill more than doubling.

We have taken a different approach. Where Labour
was chronically short-termist, we have secured decent,
affordable energy supplies not just for the coming years,
but for the coming decades.

Our long-term plan has unlocked £59 billion of
investment in electricity. All parts of the UK will soon
be helping to deliver secure, affordable and low-carbon
energy, from the Hinkley Point nuclear power station, to

Without secure energy
supplies our country
becomes less safe and less
prosperous

offshore wind turbine manufacturing at the new Green
Port in Hull, the next generation of pipelines West of
Shetland and the Swansea tidal lagoon. Our tax cuts
have encouraged record levels of investment in existing
North Sea gas, and the birth of a new industry, shale
gas, which could create many thousands of jobs.

And we have delivered a better deal for consumers too.
We have demanded that energy companies simplify
their tariffs; encouraged more independent suppliers —
which now account for ten per cent of the household
market; and made it much easier for people to switch
energy providers.

But the job is only half done. We need a Conservative
Government to see through this long-term plan

and secure clean but affordable energy supplies for
generations to come. This means a significant expansion
in new nuclear and gas; backing good-value green
energy; and pushing for more new investment in UK
energy sources. Healthy competition, not short-termist

 

56

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

 

political intervention, is the best way to secure a good
deal for consumers. So we will keep on relentlessly
pushing for more competition to keep bills low.

This is a long-term plan to keep the lights on; keep our
homes warm; and keep families from endless worry
about their energy bills.

Under Labour, the average gas

bill more than doubled

 

Our plan of action:

We will promote competition to keep your
bills as low as possible

We have helped increase the number of independent
energy suppliers from seven to 21, made it easier for
customers to switch to better deals, slashed the number
of tariffs to just 4 per supplier, and cut switching times

in half. We will go even further, implementing the
recommendations of the Competition and Markets
Authority investigation that we triggered. We will ensure
that every home and business in the country has a Smart
Meter by 2020, delivered as cost-effectively as possible,
so consumers have instant, accurate bills and can switch
to an alternative provider within one day. And we will
support low-cost measures on energy efficiency, with the
goal of insulating a million more homes over the next five
years, supporting our commitment to tackle fuel poverty.

We will secure your energy supplies

We will continue to support the safe development of
shale gas, and ensure that local communities share the

We want a better deal - and
low bills - for hardworking
families

3.1 million people are now on

better energy tariffs

 

proceeds through generous community benefit packages.
We will create a Sovereign Wealth Fund for the North
of England, so that the shale gas resources of the North
are used to invest in the future of the North. We will
continue to support development of North Sea oil and
gas. We will provide start-up funding for promising new
renewable technologies and research, but will only give
significant support to those that clearly represent value
for money.

We will halt the spread of onshore windfarms

Onshore wind now makes a meaningful contribution

to our energy mix and has been part of the necessary
increase in renewable capacity. Onshore windfarms
often fail to win public support, however, and are unable
by themselves to provide the firm capacity that a stable
energy system requires. As a result, we will end any new
public subsidy for them and change the law so that local
people have the final say on windfarm applications.

We will protect our planet for our children

We have been the greenest government ever, setting

up the world’s first Green Investment Bank, signing a
deal to build the first new nuclear plant in a generation,
trebling renewable energy generation to 19 per cent,
bringing energy efficiency measures to over one million
homes, and committing £1 billion for carbon capture
and storage. We are the largest offshore wind market
in the world. We will push for a strong global climate
deal later this year — one that keeps the goal of limiting
global warming to two-degrees firmly in reach. At
home, we will continue to support the UK Climate
Change Act. We will cut emissions as cost-effectively as
possible, and will not support additional distorting and
expensive power sector targets.

Fighting crime and standing up for victims

 

Our commitment to you:

Your local area should be a safe place to grow up, work, raise a family and retire. We will
continue to cut crime and make your community safer. We will:

a finish the job of police reform, so you can have more confidence that your local policing

team is working effectively

m toughen sentencing and reform the prison system, so dangerous criminals are kept off

your streets

m= support victims, so that the most vulnerable in our society get the support they deserve.

= scrap the Human Rights Act and curtail the role of the European Court of Human Rights, so
that foreign criminals can be more easily deported from Britain.

 

Crime is down by more than 20 per cent since 2010,
according to the independent Crime Survey, and is at its
lowest point since records began. Lower crime means
fewer robberies, less violence on our streets, fewer lives
ruined, and more people able to feel confident about the
future.

Labour didn’t trust our brilliant policemen and women,

 

probation staff and prison officers to do their job, but
tried to micromanage every police force from Whitehall,

 

 

 

doing serious damage to officer morale, police discretion
and forces’ performance. And Labour failed to provide
sufficient prison places: tens of thousands of prisoners
were released early, putting the public at risk.

We have made progress in turning around the situation
we inherited, with comprehensive reforms to policing,
rehabilitation and the rights of victims. We have already
increased the proportion of officers working on the
frontline, and cut 4.5 million hours of police paperwork.
We have given Chief Constables a clear mandate to cut
crime, reformed stop and search, established the National
Crime Agency, strengthened the police inspectorate,
made the police more accountable through Police and
Crime Commissioners, increased transparency through
crime maps, and set up the College of Policing to drive
up professional standards.

We have made sure that 45,000 offenders will now receive
supervision and rehabilitation on release from prison,

with providers paid according to the results they achieve
in reducing reoffending. We reformed drug treatment so
that abstinence and full recovery is the goal, instead of the
routine maintenance of people’s addictions with substitute
drugs. And with new laws to crack down on domestic
violence, measures to prevent Female Genital Mutilation

Crime has been cut by more

than a fifth

 

(FGM), the first ever Modern Slavery Act, action to tackle
human trafficking and substantial progress in tackling
online child abuse, we have consistently stood up for the
most vulnerable in our society.

We will carry on making every community safer, even
when resources are tight. We will continue reducing
paperwork, increasing sentence lengths for the most
serious offences, and making sure that prisons are places
of rehabilitation.

We need to complete our revolution in the way we manage
offenders in the community, using the latest technology to
keep criminals on the straight and narrow. And we must
also become smarter when it comes to crime prevention,
dealing with the drivers of crime such as drugs and
alcohol. So we will focus not only on punishment, but also

 

58

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

 

on rehabilitating offenders and intervening early to prevent
troubled young people being drawn into crime.

Our plan of action:

We will finish the job of police reform, backing
officers to fight crime unimpeded

We will ensure proper provision of health and community-
based places of safety for people suffering mental health
crises — saving police time and stopping vulnerable people
being detained in police custody. To speed up justice, we
will extend the use of police-led prosecutions. We will allow
police forces to retain a greater percentage of the value

of assets they seize from criminals. We will improve our
response to cyber-crime with reforms to police training and
an expansion in the number of volunteer ‘Cyber Specials’.
We will enable fire and police services to work more

closely together and develop the role of our elected and
accountable Police and Crime Commissioners.

We will transform the relationship between
the police and the public

We have taken action to boost public confidence and trust
in the police and now want to go even further. We will
improve the diversity of police recruitment — especially

of black and ethnic minority officers — by supporting

the development of new direct entry and fast-track
schemes such as Police Now, which offers top graduates

a new route into policing. We will overhaul the police
complaints system. We will use the Police Innovation Fund
to accelerate the adoption of new technologies, including
mobile devices, that will transform the service the public
receives. And we will legislate to mandate changes in police
practices if stop and search does not become more targeted
and stop to arrest ratios do not improve.

We will introduce more effective crime
prevention measures to break the cycle of
offending

We are developing a modern crime prevention strategy
to address the key drivers of crime. We will publish
standards, performance data and a ranking system for
the security of smartphones and tablets, as well as online
financial and retail services. We will overhaul the system
of police cautions, and ensure that offenders always

have conditions, such as victim redress, attached to their
punishment. We will create a blanket ban on all new
psychoactive substances, protecting young people from
exposure to so-called ‘legal highs’. And we will make
sobriety orders available to all courts in England and
Wales, enforced through new alcohol monitoring tags.

We will reform our prison system

Despite making savings in the prison budget, there are
around 3,000 more adult male prison places today than in
2010. We will make further savings by closing old, inefficient
prisons, building larger, modern and fit-for-purpose ones
and expanding payment-by-results. And we will introduce
widespread random testing of drug use in jails, new body
scanners, greater use of mobile phone blocking technology
and a new strategy to tackle corruption in prisons.

There are around 3,000 more
adult male prison places today

than in 2010

 

We will protect victims and support the
vulnerable

We have already introduced a new Victims’ Code and
taken steps to protect vulnerable witnesses and victims.
Now we will strengthen victims’ rights further, with

a new Victims’ Law that will enshrine key rights for
victims, including the right to make a personal statement
and have it read in court before sentencing — and before
the Parole Board decides on a prisoner's release. We

will give all vulnerable victims and witnesses greater
opportunity to give evidence outside court, and roll out
nationally pre-trial cross examination for child victims.

We will prioritise tackling violence against
women and girls

We have made protecting women and girls from
violence and supporting victims and survivors of
sexual violence a key priority. We will now work with
local authorities, the NHS and Police and Crime
Commissioners to ensure a secure future for specialist
FGM and forced marriage units, refuges and rape
crisis centres. We will ensure that all publicly-funded

advocates have specialist victims' training before
becoming involved in serious sexual offences cases. We
have set up and independant statutory inquiry into
child sexual abuse, and will make sure it can challange
institutions and individuals without fear or favour, and
get to the truth. And we will continue the urgent work
of overhauling how our police, social services and other
agencies work together to protect vulnerable children,
especially from the kind of organised grooming and
sexual exploitation that has come to light in Rotherham,
and other towns and cities across the UK.

We will toughen sentencing and use new
technology to protect the public

We will continue to reform the way we rehabilitate
prisoners. We will deploy new technology to monitor
offenders in the community and to bring persistent
offenders to justice more quickly. A new semi-custodial
sentence will be introduced for prolific criminals, allowing
for a short, sharp spell in custody to change behaviour.

To tackle those cases where judges get it wrong, we will
extend the scope of the Unduly Lenient Scheme, so a
wider range of sentences can be challenged. We will
review the legislation governing hate crimes, including the
case for extending the scope of the law to cover crimes
committed against people on the basis of disability, sexual

orientation or transgender identity. We will improve

the treatment of women offenders, exploring how new
technology may enable more women with young children
to serve their sentence in the community.

We will reform human rights law and our
legal system

We have stopped prisoners from having the vote, and
have deported suspected terrorists such as Abu Qatada,
despite all the problems created by Labour’s human rights
laws. The next Conservative Government will scrap the
Human Rights Act, and introduce a British Bill of Rights.
This will break the formal link between British courts and
the European Court of Human Rights, and make our
own Supreme Court the ultimate arbiter of human rights
matters in the UK. We will continue the £375 million
modernisation of our courts system, reducing delay and
frustration for the public. And we will continue to review
our legal aid systems, so they can continue to provide
access to justice in an efficient way.

We will scrap the Human
Rights Act and introduce a
British Bill of Rights

Preventing terrorism, countering extremism

 

Our commitment to you:

Keeping you and your family safe is our overriding priority. The threat of extremism and
terrorism remains serious, but with our tough, intelligent and comprehensive approach, we will

confront and ultimately defeat it. We will:

a strengthen the ability of the police and intelligence agencies to disrupt terrorist plots,
so the authorities have all the tools they need to prevent attacks

= deal with online radicalisation and propaganda, so we can reduce the risk of young
people being drawn into extremism and terrorism

a tackle all forms of extremism, including non-violent extremism, so our values and our way

of life are properly promoted and defended

 

The first duty of government is to keep you safe. We
will always do whatever is necessary to protect the
British people. We have protected and increased the
budgets for the security and intelligence agencies and
counter-terrorism policing. But the scale of the threat
to our country from a number of terrorist groups
remains serious, and the rise of ISIL in Syria and Iraq
has created new havens for terrorists from which attacks
against Britain can be planned, financed and directed.

We will always do whatever
is necessary to protect the
British people

However, the nature of the threat we face is making

it more difficult for the security services to identify
terrorist plots — especially thanks to new technology. We
must always ensure our outstanding intelligence and
security agencies have the powers they need to keep

us safe. At the same time, we continue to reject any
suggestions of sweeping, authoritarian measures that
would threaten our hard-won freedoms. In the last year
alone, we have given the authorities greater powers to
disrupt and control the movements of people who want
to travel abroad to fight, including strengthening powers
to confiscate the passports of those seeking to travel to
commit terrorism.

The next Conservative Government will continue to
take a tough, intelligent and comprehensive approach
to preventing terrorism and confronting extremism.
We will update our counter-terrorism laws wherever
necessary to make sure they properly reflect the threats
we face.

Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada

removed from this country once
and for all

 

Dealing with these threats is not just about new powers.
It is about how we combat extremism in all its forms.
We need to tackle it at root, before it takes the form

of violence and terror. At the heart of our approach
lies an uncompromising defence of British values,

and a very simple message: in Britain, you do not just
enjoy the freedom to live how you choose; you have a
responsibility to respect others too.

Our plan of action:

We will strengthen counter-terrorism powers

We have strengthened counter-terrorism laws, including
making it easier to stop British nationals travelling

abroad to fight, and control the return of those who
do. We will keep up to date the ability of the police and
security services to access communications data — the
‘who, where, when and how’ of a communication,

but not its content. Our new communications data
legislation will strengthen our ability to disrupt terrorist
plots, criminal networks and organised child grooming
gangs, even as technology develops. We will maintain
the ability of the authorities to intercept the content

of suspects’ communications, while continuing to
strengthen oversight of the use of these powers.

We will confront all forms of extremism,
including non-violent extremism

We have already reformed the Prevent strategy so that
it focuses on non-violent as well as violent extremism.
We will now go even further. We will outlaw groups
that foment hate with the introduction of new Banning
Orders for extremist organisations. ‘These could be
applied to dangerous organisations that fall short

of the existing thresholds for proscription under

Over 75,000 pieces of unlawful

material have been taken down
from the internet

 

terrorism legislation. To restrict the harmful activities
of extremist individuals, we will create new Extremism
Disruption Orders. These new powers might, for
instance, prevent those who are seeking to radicalise
young British people online from using the internet

or communicating via social media. We will develop a
strategy to tackle the infiltration of extremists into our
schools and public services. We will strengthen Ofcom’s
role so that tough measures can be taken against
channels that broadcast extremist content.

We will enable employers to check whether an
individual is an extremist and bar them from working
with children. And we will take further measures

to ensure colleges and universities do not give a
platform to extremist speakers.

Dignity in your retirement

 

Our commitment to you:

If you have worked hard during your life, saved, paid your taxes and done the right thing, you
deserve dignity and security when you retire. We want Britain to be the best country in which to

grow old. We will:

u take the family home out of Inheritance Tax for all but the richest by raising the effective
threshold for married couples and civil partners to £1 million

= continue to increase the State Pension through our triple lock, so it rises by at least 2.5 per

cent, inflation or earnings, whichever is highest

m reward saving by introducing a new single-tier pension

= give you the freedom to invest and spend your pension however you like - and let you

pass it on to your loved ones tax-free

= protect pensioner benefits including the free bus pass, TV licences and Winter Fuel Payment

m ensure Britain has a strong economy, so we can continue to protect the NHS and make sure
no-one is forced to sell their home to pay for care.

 

Our pensioners have made this country what it is, and we
believe that, in return, younger generations owe it to them
to ensure they have dignity and security in their old age.

In office, Labour neglected the elderly. They raided
pensions with a £150 billion stealth tax. One year they
increased pensions by a paltry 75 pence. And they

did nothing to give people control over their savings
and pensions, or to stop them from having to sell their
homes to pay for care. In place of these meagre pension
increases, we have introduced the triple lock: the Basic
State Pension will now always rise in line with whichever
is higher — earnings, inflation or 2.5 per cent. Since
2010, we have seen the Basic Pension has risen in value
by £950. We have abolished the Default Retirement
Age, so you can keep working as long as you like. We

We are building a Britain
where everyone who has
worked hard and done the
right thing can enjoy security
in retirement

are replacing the Pension Credit — basically a means
test — with a new Single-Tier Pension: whatever people
save, they will keep. And we have introduced a cap

on residential social care costs: no one will have to sell
their home to pay for care. On top of all this, we have
scrapped compulsory annuities, giving people complete
control over their pension pots; kept all pensioner
benefits; and protected NHS spending.

In the next five years, as our country recovers and
our elderly population grows, we will continue to put
pensioners at the heart of our long-term economic plan.

Our plan of action:

We will look after you as you grow older

We will cap charges for residential social care

from April 2016 and also allow deferred payment
agreements, so no one has to sell their home. For the
first time, individual liabilities will be limited, giving
everyone the peace of mind that they will receive

the care they need, and that they will be protected
from unlimited costs if they develop very serious care

We will continue to increase the

Basic State Pension through our
‘triple lock’ guarantee

 

needs — such as dementia. We will protect the NHS
budget and we will prioritise funding for dementia
research.

We will guarantee your financial security as
you grow older

We will keep the triple lock pension system. From April
2016 we are bringing in a Single Tier Pension; this will
effectively abolish means-testing the pensions of people
who have contributed all their lives. We will maintain
all the current pensioner benefits including Winter Fuel
Payments, free bus passes, free prescriptions and TV
licences for the next Parliament, while implementing
the ""temperature test"" for Winter Fuel Payment, so that
expats in hot countries no longer receive it. And we will
allow pensioners to access their pension savings and
decide whether or not to take out an annuity, so they can
make their own decisions about their money.

We will help you support your loved-ones

We have guaranteed that ISAs can now be passed on to a
spouse tax-free, so that from this April they are no longer
subject to Income Tax and Capital Gains Tax. We have
abolished the 55 per cent tax on pension pots, so that
when the deceased is 75 or over any beneficiary only has
to pay their marginal Income Tax rate — normally 20 per
cent — when they draw down the pension. And we have
enabled anyone who dies before the age of 75 to pass on
their pension pot completely tax-free, so that beneficiaries
will pay no tax on pensions they inherit or on the income
they draw down. And we will take the family home out
of tax for all but the richest by increasing the effective
Inheritance Tax threshold for married couples and civil
partners to £1 million, with a new transferable main
residence allowance of £175,000 per person. ‘This

will be paid for by reducing the tax relief on pension
contributions for people earning more than £150,000.

It’s your money, you worked
hard for it - and you should
be able to pass it onto your
loved-ones

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

 

Stronger together: a Union for the 21st century

 

Our commitment to you:

Wherever you live in the great nations of our United Kingdom, we are on your side. We will:

u give English MPs a veto over matters only affecting England, including on Income Tax

a honour in full our commitments to Scotland to devolve extensive new powers

au implement the agreed settlement for Wales, handing over more responsibility to the

Welsh Assembly

= continue to build a Northern Ireland where politics works, the economy grows and

society is strong.

 

England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — ours
is the greatest union of nations the world has ever seen.
Together we have done so much, and we can do much
more. The Conservative Party is the party of the Union
~ and we will always do our utmost to keep our family
of nations together.

It was right to create the Scottish Parliament and Welsh
Assembly, but the job was not finished. Without the
ability to raise money, the devolved Parliaments were not
accountable to taxpayers. Without devolution to local
councils and communities, power felt as distant as ever.
And one fundamental unfairness remains today: Scottish
MPs are able to cast the decisive vote on matters that
only affected England and Wales, while English and
Welsh MPs cannot vote on matters that only affect
Scotland. This leaves a space for resentment to fester —
and put our Union in jeopardy.

We have tackled the problems we inherited. First, we
held the referendum on Scottish independence. It was
the right thing to do, and the question of Scotland’s
place in the United Kingdom is now settled. We have
made the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly
responsible for funding more of what they spend. We
have agreed with Northern Ireland’s parties a deal to
help ensure that politics works, the economy grows and
society is more cohesive and united. And we have set out
clear plans for English votes for English laws.

All this reflects a core Conservative belief: power to the
people. Around Britain you can see that principle in practice.

In town halls, councillors now have more of a say over public
spending. In communities, local people have the right to

vote in referendums on council tax rises. Neighbourhoods
are deciding what is built in their area and what happens to
assets such as parks and public buildings.

We believe in giving power
to hardworking taxpayers,
letting you decide on the
issues that affect you and
your family

Our commitment to the Union means we want to
strengthen it. We will let local people have more say on
local planning and let them vote on local issues. We will
not let anyone impose artificial regions on England —
our traditional towns, boroughs, cities and counties are
here to stay. We will continue devolution settlements

for Scotland and Wales, and implement the Stormont
House Agreement in Northern Ireland. And we will give
English MPs a veto over English-only matters, including
on Income Tax — answering the West Lothian Question.

In the last five years, we have proven that we are the
party of the Union. We will go further in the next
Parliament, pushing power out beyond Westminster,
Cardiff Bay, Holyrood and Stormont, so we keep our
United Kingdom strong and secure for the long term.

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

 

Our plan of action:

We will build an enduring settlement for the
United Kingdom

We will work to ensure a stable constitution that is fair to
the people of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern
Ireland. We will strengthen and improve devolution

for each part of our United Kingdom in a way that
accepts that there is no one-size-fits-all solution: we will
implement the Smith Commission and St David’s Day
Agreement or equivalent changes in the rest of the UK,
including English votes for English laws.

We will give English MPs a veto over matters
only affecting England

We will maintain the Westminster Parliament as the UK
and England’s law-making body. But we want Parliament
to work in a way that ensures decisions affecting England,

or England and Wales, can only be taken with the consent
of the majority of MPs representing constituencies in
England, or in England and Wales. We will end the manifest
unfairness whereby Scotland is able to decide its own laws in
devolved areas, only for Scottish MPs also to be able to have
the potentially decisive say on similar matters that affect only
England and Wales. We will maintain the integrity of the
UK Parliament by ensuring that MPs from all parts of the
UK continue to deliberate and vote together, including to set
overall spending levels. But we will:

m change parliamentary procedures so that the detail of
legislation affecting only England or England and Wales
will be considered by a Committee drawn in proportion
to party strength in England or England and Wales.

m adda new stage to how English legislation is
passed; no bill or part of a bill relating only to
England would be able to pass to its Third Reading
and become law without being approved through a
legislative consent motion by a Grand Committee
made up of all English MPs, or all English and
Welsh MPs.

m extend the principle of English consent to financial
matters such as how spending is distributed within
England and to taxation — including an English rate
of Income Tax — when the equivalent decisions have
been devolved to Scotland.

We will honour in full our commitments to
Scotland

A new Scotland Bill will be in our first Queen’s Speech and
will be introduced in the first session of a new Parliament.
We will implement the recommendations of the Smith
Commission so that more than 50 per cent of the Scottish
Parliament’s budget will be funded from revenues raised in
Scotland and it will have significant new welfare powers to
complement existing devolved powers in health and social
care. We will provide the Scottish Parliament with one of
the most extensive packages of tax and spending powers
of any devolved legislature in the world. We will retain the
Barnett Formula as the basis for determining the grant

to cover that part of the Scottish Parliament’s budget not
funded by tax revenues raised in Scotland. We will agree
new rules with the Scottish Government for how the block
grant will be adjusted, to take account of the new devolved
tax and welfare powers. And we will ensure that where
responsibility for taxation has been devolved, tax changes
only affect public spending in that part of the country.

We will implement Wales’ devolution
settlement

We will clarify the division of powers between Wales
and the UK Government. We will:

m devolve to the Welsh Assembly control over its own
affairs — including the Assembly name, size and
electoral system, Assembly elections and voting age.

m@ implement other recommendations of the second
Silk Report where there is all-party support as set
out in the St David’s Day Agreement; this will
include devolving to the Welsh Assembly important
economic powers over ports and energy consents.

@ introduce a new Wales Bill if these changes require
legislation.

™ continue to reserve policing and justice as matters for
the UK Parliament.

@ introduce a ‘funding floor’ to protect Welsh relative
funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government
to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on
Income Tax powers in the next Parliament.

 

70

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

 

m make the Welsh Government responsible for raising
more of the money it spends so the Welsh people
can hold their politicians to account.

We will continue to build a Northern Ireland
where politics works, the economy grows and
society is strong

We will maintain Northern Ireland’s position within
the United Kingdom on the basis of the consent of its
people. Our strong support for the political institutions
established over the past two decades as a result of the
various Agreements will continue. We will:

@ put the safety and security of the people of Northern
Ireland as our highest priority. We will develop and
implement our strategy to combat terrorism, giving
the strongest possible support to the brave men and

women of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.

work to implement fully and faithfully the historic
Stormont House Agreement to enable devolution to
function more effectively; to deal with the legacy of
the past; and to make progress on divisive issues such
as flags and parading.

continue to work closely with the Northern Ireland
Executive to implement commitments in the 2013
economic pact to rebalance the economy and to
build a more united and stronger society.

complete the devolution of Corporation ‘Tax powers
to the Assembly, consistent with the Executive
fulfilling its commitments on finance, welfare reform
and efficiencies in the Stormont House Agreement.

Real change in our relationship

with the European Union

 

Our commitment to you:

For too long, your voice has been ignored on Europe. We will:

m give you a say over whether we should stay in or leave the EU, with an in-out referendum

by the end of 2017

m commit to keeping the pound and staying out of the Eurozone

a reform the workings of the EU, which is too big, too bossy and too bureaucratic

a reclaim power from Brussels on your behalf and safeguard British interests in the Single

Market

m_ back businesses to create jobs in Britain by completing ambitious trade deals and

reducing red tape.

 

The EU needs to change. And it is time for the British
people — not politicians — to have their say. Only the
Conservative Party will deliver real change and real choice
on Europe, with an in-out referendum by the end of 2017.

Labour failed to give you a choice on the EU. They
handed over major new powers to Brussels without

your consent, and gave away £7 billion of the British
rebate. We have taken action in Europe to promote your
economic security. We cut the EU budget for the first
time ever, saving British taxpayers £8.15 billion. We took
Britain out of Eurozone bailouts, including for Greece —
the first ever return of powers from Brussels. Our Prime
Minister vetoed a new EU treaty that would have damaged
Britain’s interests. And we have pursued a bold, positive,
pro-business agenda, exempting smallest businesses from
red tape, promoting free trade, and pushing to extend the
Single Market to new sectors, like digital.

We believe in letting the
people decide: so we will hold
an in-out referendum on our
membership of the EU before
the end of 2017

But there is much more to do. ‘The EU is too bureaucratic
and too undemocratic. It interferes too much in our

daily lives, and the scale of migration triggered by new
members joining in recent years has had a real impact on
local communities. We are clear about what we want from
Europe. We say: yes to the Single Market. Yes to turbo-
charging free trade. Yes to working together where we are
stronger together than alone. Yes to a family of nation
states, all part of a European Union — but whose interests,
crucially, are guaranteed whether inside the Euro or out.
No to ‘ever closer union.’ No to a constant flow of power
to Brussels. No to unnecessary interference. And no, of
course, to the Euro, to participation in Eurozone bail-outs
or notions like a European Army.

It will be a fundamental principle of a future Conservative
Government that membership of the European Union
depends on the consent of the British people — and in
recent years that consent has worn wafer-thin. That’s why,
after the election, we will negotiate a new settlement for
Britain in Europe, and then ask the British people whether
they want to stay in the EU on this reformed basis or leave.
David Cameron has committed that he will only lead a
government that offers an in-out referendum. We will hold
that in-out referendum before the end of 2017 and respect
the outcome.

So the choice at this election is clear: Labour and the

 

72

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

 

Liberal Democrats won’t give you a say over the EU.
UKIP can’t give you a say. Only the Conservative

Party will deliver real change in Europe ~ and only the
Conservatives can and will deliver an in-out referendum.

Our plan of action:

We will let you decide whether to stay in
or leave the EU

We will legislate in the first session of the next Parliament
for an in-out referendum to be held on Britain’s
membership of the EU before the end of 2017. We will
negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the EU. And then
we will ask the British people whether they want to stay

in on this basis, or leave. We will honour the result of the
referendum, whatever the outcome.

We will protect Britain's economy

We will protect our economy from any further integration
of the Eurozone. The integration of the Eurozone has
raised acute questions for non-Eurozone countries like the
United Kingdom. We benefit from the Single Market and
do not want to stand in the way of the Eurozone resolving
its difficulties. Indeed, given the trade between Britain and
the Eurozone countries we want to see these economies
returning to growth. But we will not let the integration of
the Eurozone jeopardise the integrity of the Single Market
or in any way disadvantage the UK.

We will reclaim powers from Brussels

We want to see powers flowing away from Brussels, not

to it. We have already taken action to return around 100
powers, but we want to go further. We want national
parliaments to be able to work together to block unwanted
European legislation. And we want an end to our
commitment to an ‘ever closer union,’ as enshrined in

David Cameron vetoed a new EU
Treaty that would have damaged

Britain's interests — the first time
in history that a British Prime
Minister has done so

 

the Treaty to which every EU country has to sign up.
Furthermore, we will continue to ensure that defence
policy remains firmly under British national control,
maintaining NATO and the transatlantic relationship as
the cornerstones of our defence and security policy.

We will scrap the Human Rights Act

We will scrap Labour's Human Rights Act and introduce
a British Bill of Rights which will restore common sense

to the application of human rights in the UK. The Bill
will remain faithful to the basic principles of human

rights, which we signed up to in the original European
Convention on Human Rights. It will protect basic rights,
like the right to a fair trial, and the right to life, which are
an essential part of a modern democratic society. But it will
reverse the mission creep that has meant human rights law
being used for more and more purposes, and often with
little regard for the rights of wider society. Among other
things the Bill will stop terrorists and other serious foreign
criminals who pose a threat to our society from using
spurious human rights arguments to prevent deportation.

We will take action in Europe to make
you better off

We want an EU that helps Britain move ahead, not

one that holds us back. We have already succeeded

in exempting our smallest businesses from new EU
regulations, and kicked-off negotiations for a massive

EU trade deal with the USA, which could be worth
billions of pounds to the UK economy. We will build

on this. We want to preserve the integrity of the Single
Market, by insisting on protections for those countries
that have kept their own currencies. We want to expand
the Single Market, breaking down the remaining barriers
to trade and ensuring that new sectors are opened

up to British firms. We want to ensure that new rules
target unscrupulous behaviour in the financial services
industry, while safeguarding Britain as a global centre of
excellence in finance. So we will resist EU attempts to
restrict legitimate financial services activities. We will press
for lower EU spending, further reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy and Structural Funds, and for EU
money to be focused on promoting jobs and growth.

A Britain standing tall in the world

 

Our commitment to you:

Everything we do around the world will be driven by a determination to protect your security

and help you prosper. We will:

m ensure Britain is a major player on the world stage, using diplomacy to protect your
interests, uphold British values and tackle threats to your security and prosperity

a help generate new trade, investment and job opportunities, to benefit you and your family

= maintain our world class Armed Forces so they continue to guarantee your security

a uphold our commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income on international

development.

 

Economic security and national security are two sides
of the same coin. Without one, you cannot have the
other. Our prosperity depends upon Britain remaining
an active, outward-looking nation, one that is engaged
with the world, not looking in on itself. We will maintain
Britain’s strong global role and our capacity to project
British power and values around the world.

We want a strong, secure
and stable country

Labour’s Great Recession weakened Britain on the
world stage. They left a £38 billion black hole in the
defence budget, went 12 years without conducting

a Strategic Defence Review, and, at times, failed to
provide our Armed Forces with the equipment they
needed in Afghanistan. They shut down over 30

British diplomatic missions, failed to plan properly for
Iraq’s reconstruction, ignored trade and investment
opportunities overseas, and neglected vital relationships.

We have strengthened Britain’s influence in the world. The
National Security Council that we established ensures proper,
strategic decision-making at the top of government. We have
boosted exports to emerging markets, opened new diplomatic
posts in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and led the world

in promoting women’s rights and tackling sexual violence in
conflict. We have balanced the defence budget and set out a
clear strategy to defend our nation for the long term.

We and our allies face major challenges: Islamist
extremism, an aggressive Russia, economic uncertainty
in the Eurozone, nuclear proliferation and infectious
diseases. A Conservative Government will tackle these
challenges. We will use our membership of NATO, the
EU, the Commonwealth, our UN Security Council seat,
our Special Relationship with the USA, our intelligence
agencies, vital institutions like the BBC World Service
and British Council, and the strong personal links
between our diaspora communities and other countries,
to achieve the best for Britain.

Only with a strong economy
can we maintain our world-
class Armed Forces and
protect our national security

We will back this up with UK military power and
international aid. Our long-term economic plan will
ensure we have the economic strength to maintain

our world-class Armed Forces, to uphold our national
security and project power globally. Aid helps prevent
failed states from becoming havens for terrorists.

It builds long-term markets for our businesses, by
promoting global prosperity, and reduces migration
pressures. So we will maintain our commitment to
tackling conflict, poverty and disease around the world.

Our plan of action:

We will protect our nation

We will continue to keep our Armed Forces strong so they
can continue to keep you safe. We will maintain the size
of the regular armed services and not reduce the army

to below 82,000. We will retain the Trident continuous at
sea nuclear deterrent to provide the ultimate guarantee
of our safety and build the new fleet of four Successor
Ballistic Missile Submarines — securing thousands of
highly-skilled engineering jobs in the UK. We will work
closely with our allies to continue to strengthen NATO

— supporting its new multi-national rapid response force.
We will maintain our global presence, strengthening our
defence partnerships in the Gulf and Asia. Later this year,
we will hold a National Security Strategy and Strategic
Defence and Security Review to plan for the future.

We will maintain a balanced defence budget
and give our Armed Forces the equipment
they need

We can only have strong, well-funded Armed Forces by
continuing to build a stronger economy. We have the second
largest defence budget in NATO and the largest in the EU.
We are meeting NATO’s two targets: that each country
should spend two per cent of its gross national income on
defence, and of that spending 20 per cent should go on
major equipment. We have made commitments for the
equipment plan to be funded at one per cent above inflation
for the next Parliament. We plan to invest at least £160
billion in new military equipment over the next decade: as
well as our six new Type 45 destroyers, we are building a

class of seven Astute submarines and buying the Joint Strike
Fighter, Scout armoured vehicles, Type 26 frigates and

new Apache attack helicopters. We will bring both of our
new Aircraft Carriers - HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS
Prince of Wales, the largest vessels the Royal Navy has ever
possessed — into service, so we have one available for use at
all times. We will continue to seek value for money in defence
procurement, recognising the important contribution that
the UK defence industry makes to our prosperity.

We have the biggest defence
budget in the EU - and the

second biggest in NATO

 

We will maintain strong, modern Armed
Forces

Modern, flexible Armed Forces need strong reserve capacity,
alongside strong regular forces. We have invested significantly
in our reserves, and we will deliver on our commitment

to expand them to 35,000. We will continue to invest in

our cyber defence capabilities. We will also provide more
opportunities for talented people from all communities and
walks of life to serve their country. We will ensure our Armed
Forces overseas are not subject to persistent human rights
claims that undermine their ability to do their job.

We will do all we can to honour
those who give so much

We will continue to honour the Armed Forces
Covenant

We have honoured our commitment to enshrine the
Armed Forces Covenant in law and done much to
support our servicemen and women. We have delivered
better accommodation for service families, helped
service personnel buy their own home, and ensured that
children of members of the Armed Forces benefit from
the Pupil Premium. We have delivered proper mental
health support and priority access to medical treatments
for veterans. ‘To ensure that those who serve can enjoy
greater economic security, we have boosted allowances
and tax reliefs. We have protected pensions for our
servicemen and women. We have ensured that injured
service personnel have access to the latest prosthetics and

world-class rehabilitation facilities. And we have used
£450 million of LIBOR fines from banks to support the
Armed Forces community. The money has been used

to support a wide range of charities and good causes,
from providing better play facilities for the children of
service families, to helping rehabilitation through sport for
injured veterans. We pressed for the introduction of the
Arctic Star medal — for veterans of the Arctic Convoys
—and the Bomber Command Clasp, to ensure proper
recognition for those who risked their lives to keep us free.
We will build on this proud record, implementing Lord
Ashcrofi’s recommendations on the way the nation fulfils
its obligations to veterans. We will work to address hearing
loss among veterans. And we will continue to support

the unsung heroes of the Armed Forces community: the
partners and families of those who serve.

Tackling global challenges to make you safer

and more prosperous

 

Our plan of action:

We will continue to honour our commitments

Tackling global poverty is both the right thing to do
and in Britain’s interests. We have delivered on our
promises to meet the UN target of spending 0.7 per
cent of national income as aid and to enshrine this in
law. We will continue to meet the 0.7 per cent target,
maintain an independent Department for International
Development and keep aid untied. Our aid budget
meets the OECD aid rules, and we will actively engage
in international discussions to ensure that these rules
fully reflect the importance of peace, stability and
effective institutions for reducing poverty. We will insist
that every government and organisation we fund meets
global transparency standards.

We will save lives

By 2020, we will save 1.4 million children’s lives, by
immunising 76 million children against killer diseases.
We will help at least 11 million children in the poorest
countries gain a decent education, improve nutrition
for at least 50 million people, who would otherwise go
hungry; and help at least 60 million people get access

By 2020, we will save 1.4
million children's lives

to clean water and sanitation, to stop terrible diseases.
We will continue to lead the response to humanitarian
emergencies, and establish a means to respond rapidly
to crises. Our leading role in dealing with the recent
outbreak of Ebola in West Africa is a good example

of how our aid programme helps protect Britain from
serious threats, while also helping countries tackle major
emergencies which put their stability at risk. We will
lead a major new global programme to accelerate the
development of vaccines and drugs to eliminate the
world’s deadliest infectious diseases, while investing to
save lives from malaria and working to end preventable
child and maternal deaths. We will expand payment by
results and ensure all money to governments is clearly
earmarked for specific purposes.

We will tackle the causes of poverty and
promote gender equality

We will push for new global goals to eradicate extreme
poverty by 2030 and promote human development,

 

78

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

 

gender equality and good governance. We will work

to prevent climate change and assist the poorest in
adapting to it. As the route out of poverty is about
much more than just aid, we will boost growth and
jobs, making it easier for people to start up businesses
and trade freely with each other. We will continue to
promote the golden thread of democracy, the rule of
law, property rights, a free media and open, accountable
institutions. We will promote girls’ education, encourage
equal access to property rights and work to achieve
access to family planning for everyone who wants it. We
will continue to lead efforts to tackle violence against
women and girls, end FGM and combat early and

forced marriage, both at home and abroad.

We will help you fight poverty

Our International Citizen Service has given thousands
of young Brits the opportunity to volunteer abroad. We
will triple it in size. We will also double our successful
Aid Match scheme, which matches donations to
charity from the aid budget. We will boost partnerships
between UK institutions and their counterparts in the
developing world, and help people in the UK give or
lend money directly to individuals and entrepreneurs
around the world.

Conclusion

SO THIS IS OUR DETAILED PLAN FOR BRITAIN.

Our plan to entrench the progress of the past five years. Our plan for you and your
family, at every stage of your life.

IT IS UNDERPINNED BY SOME SIMPLE CONSERVATIVE VALUES.

Those who work hard and do the right thing must be rewarded. Everyone should
be able to rise as high as their talents and effort will take them. We measure
our success not just in how we show our strength abroad, but in how we care for
the weakest and most vulnerable at home.

ABOVE ALL, RUNNING THROUGH THIS PLAN
IS A TRUE BELIEF IN BRITAIN.

In the past five years, as so often before in our history, we have once again
defied the expectations of the world to rise up and meet our challenges. The British
character is renewed every day by the millions who work hard, raise their families, care for
those who need help, who do the right thing — and make this country what it is.

THIS MANIFESTO IS ABOUT IMPROVING THE LIVES
OF EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE.

Together we have come so far. If we stick to our long-term plan, we can secure
a better future for you and your family. So let us keep moving forward; and set our sights
on making our great country greater still.

THE BRITISH DREAM

IBELEVE thatBritan cou be dong so much better.

Our county has everything gong for tC reatve fh, wor beating
com pangs, g bbaly-respected unversites, a trad iton of torrance,a
bve of freedom , a taknt for enterprse, a concem for the underdog
and the abiliy tp pulltogethern acrss.

Brian 5 a great country. But today it & heading hn the wrong

diecton.Far too many peop are heH back from achevng they ful
potentalA thousand everyday frustatons prevent the B ritsh peopk

from Ivng fulfilled Wes.

 

 

 

 

Conservatives know thatgovemm ents don’thave allthe answers.But
if they govem wih the rphtvales, they can make a realdifference.
Today, Brita & beng govemed with the wrong vales.

stead of rewarding fam ies who do the rght thing, work hard and
pay ther taxes, Mr Bx's Govemm ent takes them for granted. And
after eyhtyears nh power, allhe offers 5 more tak.

Meanwhik, peopk wory about nfectons they myht catch n
hospita& whrh are dity when they shouH be ckan. Parents worry
about ther chitren not kamnng to read and write propery n
chssrooms whxh are unrmy, not dscpined. hh too many
comm unites it responsbk citzens, not crm nak and yobs, who
wak i fear. Our outofcontol nm gratbn system encourages
peopk sm ugg-rs and penalses genune refugees. And allths has
happened despie huge, stealthy increases jh taxatbn.

So bng as ths contnues, the peopk of ths county are deprved of
the chance to be allthey can be. They shouHn thave to settk for ths.

At ths ekctbn there 5 a chance for us to be optm Str about our
future agan. Peopk have been Et down by a G ovemm ent that has
bst touch with them .On May 5th they can ekcta Govemm ent that
focuses on the things that matter A Govemment that acts - and
delvers resuls.A G ovemm ent thatdoes exactly what itsays.

W ewilbe am bitous frourcountry - a Conservative G ovemm entw il
aspie td give everyone the chance to make the m ostof they Wves.We
willgovem on behaf of the forgotten m apriy and they valies, the
peop who make up the backbone of our country: peopk who work
hard; save to buy they frsthom e; take responsbiliy for ther fam ies.
Peopk who do the rght thing shou be rewarded, notpunsBhed.

We will extend chore - a Conservatve Govemment wil give
Hidiviuak more contolover ther own money and over the pubic
serves we alldepend on.

We wildevole power from the centre to our communites - a
Conservative G ovemm entw iltustprofessbnak and enabE parents
and patents to shape services accord ng to therneeds.

 

Wewilsecure the foundations of a successfuland decentsocBty -
a Conservative G ovemm entw il tit the bance of the jistte system
ch favour of the vet , and wilrestore contolof ourborders.We wil
sette our rehtpnshp with the European Unbn by brngng powers
back from Brusse& to Brian.

The Britsh peopk shoul feelconfilent that they can get on with
ther Ives whie ther Govemment concentrates on tackling the
practcalprobkm s whtrh matter to them . That why a Conservative
G ovemm entwilbe focused on ckaner hospiak, schooldscyp ine,
more polce, contolked inm Yraton and bwer taxes.

Im x polis to give something back to the country whrh gave so
much to me.As the chit of inm grants, as a state schoolpupil as
the fist person hn my fam iy to go to unversity, Iam driven by a
profound sense of prile h Brian.

Forme the heart of poltrs & allabout peopk - ther hopes and
aspzatpns.Peopk want the freedom , security and opportuniy tp get

They want the freedom to take the mportantdecsDns about ther
fam ies and to keep more of the money they eam. They want the
security thatgoes w ith owning yourhom e, saving for your retrem ent,
lving ia safe neghbourhood. They want the opportunity proviled
by a good educatbn and a thrivng econom y.

And they expect far phy. Ibeleve that tp be treated equaly Ba
bithrght, and that dscrmnatpn & wrong. A Conservative
Govemm entwilgovem 7 the nterests of everyone i our sockty -
black orwhite, young oro, stayhtor gay, ruralorurban, rch orpoor.

Peopk are tred of poltcans who tak and tak, but failto delver.
They're tred of politcans sayng one thing before an ekcton and

Govemm ent wil not ony make a difference: t wilbe different.
Accountability w ilbe ourwatchword. Ths manifesto sets outckary
ourprprites forwhatwe w illdo, how we willpay fort, and the valies

Our econom & success over generatons has been buiton the hard

prosperity, govemm entm ustonce agai start to Wwe withn is means.
The consequences of Labour's profigacy are now phi to see. Last
year, average lvng standards fellfor the frsttm e n overa decade -
and the poorest10 percentof Britons became poorer.

We need to change diecton.

The way n whch a govemment albcates taxpayers’ money

dem onstrates is valies.By gong to waronwaste and ending hefectve

pubic spending program mes, we wilachéve three smpk ains.

Fist, we wilgie taxpayers valle form oney.W e wilspend the same
as Labour woul on the NHS, schook, transport and ntematbnal
devebpment, and more than Labour on polce, defence and
pensbns.Butwe w ilsave £12 billon a yearby 2007-8 by cutthg back
other expendiure. We will freeze civilservre recruim ent, rem ove
235,000 bureaucratt posts, and cutorabolsh 168 pubic bodes.

Over the perbd to 2011-12, we willncrease govemm ent spending
by 4 percenta year, com pared to Labour's pans (on cunenttends)

to Ncrease spending by 5 percenta year.

Second, we wil avoid further Labour stealth taxes by reducng
govemm ent borrow ng. Of our £12 billon savings, we wiluse £8
billon to reduce Labour's excessive bonow hg, so thatwe can avol
the tax rses thatwoul othe Be be needed.

Thad, we w ilbwer taxes.W e beleve thatpeopk shoul choose how
thei m oney & spent. They shoul be rewarded for ther hard work
and be given peace of m nd HOU age.W e willuse the rem anng £4
biln of our£12 billon savings to cut taxes hh our frstBudget.

Lower taxes prom ote enterprse and growth. But they ako prom ote
the rpht valies. Hard -workng fam ies have suffered from Labour's
tax rails on mortgages and marrage, pensbns and peto] buyng a

home and having a pb.

Better Healthcare and C kanerHospitab

Record amounts of taxpayers’ money have been spent on the
NHS. Yet over a m ion peop are stilwaitng for teatm ent, and

average waitng tmes have gone up. More peopk d® each year

 

 

from nfectons they pxk up n hospiak than on Brian's roads.

Taxpayers have not received vale for money because the NHS
has not been refomed. IS too mMpersonal, too nfexbk, too
centralsed and too bureaucratc to respond to the needs of
patents.

Staff i the health service - from doctors and nurses to porters

INVITATION TO JOIN THE GOVERNMENT OF BRITAIN

 

A country is at its best when the bonds between people are strong and when the sense of
national purpose is clear. Today the challenges facing Britain are immense. Our economy is
overwhelmed by debt, our social fabric is frayed and our political system has betrayed the people.
But these problems can be overcome if we pull together and work together. If we remember that
we are all in this together.

Some politicians say: ‘give us your vote and we will sort out all your problems’. We say:
real change comes not from government alone. Real change comes when the people are

inspired and mobilised, when millions of us are fired up to play a part in the nation’s future.

Yes this is ambitious. Yes it is optimistic. But in the end all the Acts of Parliament, all
the new measures, all the new policy initiatives, are just politicians’ words without you and

your involvement.

How will we deal with the debt crisis unless we understand that we are all in this together?
How will we raise responsible children unless every adult plays their part? How will we
revitalise communities unless people stop asking ‘who will fix this?’ and start asking ‘what can
I do?’ Britain will change for the better when we all elect to take part, to take responsibility — if

we all come together. Collective strength will overpower our problems.

Only together can we can get rid of this government and, eventually, its debt. Only together
can we get the economy moving. Only together can we protect the NHS. Improve our schools.
Mend our broken society. Together we can even make politics and politicians work better. And

if we can do that, we can do anything. Yes, together we can do anything.

So my invitation today is this: join us, to form a new kind of government for Britain.

FOREWORD

 

Britain needs change: few can doubt that. Our national finances are mired in massive debt.
Millions are living the misery of unemployment. Communities are shattered by crime and abuse.
People in the public services are trapped in a web of rules and regulations. People have lost faith
that politics can fix our problems, or that politicians can lead us into a better future. There is a

feeling of helplessness. Once again, there is a mood afoot that the decline of Britain is inevitable.

But there is no law that says we must accept decline. We have the energy, the ideas and the
ambition to get Britain back on track. And that includes everyone in Britain, wherever they live
and whatever their circumstances. If we join together, if we act decisively, and move forward with
optimism, we can start to fix the economic, social and political problems that threaten the nation.

We can bring about the change Britain needs.

What is that change? Some promise solutions from on high — but real change comes from
collective endeavour. So we offer a new approach: a change not just from one set of politicians to
another; from one set of policies to another. It is a change from one political philosophy to another.
From the idea that the role of the state is to direct society and micro-manage public services, to the
idea that the role of the state is to strengthen society and make public services serve the people who

use them. In a simple phrase, the change we offer is from big government to Big Society.

This manifesto is the most important stage so far on a journey that began four and a half years
ago, when the Conservative Party itself voted for change by electing David Cameron as its leader.
Since then, the Party has remoulded itself for the modern era, applying its deepest values and
beliefs to the urgent problems of the hour. Even as it has done so, the problems confronting Britain
have escalated, and escalated fast. So our ideas are ambitious and radical as well as modern. They
match the scale of Britain’s problems, and are in tune with a world that is changing before our eyes.

But our core values have not altered and our core beliefs remain consistent.

We believe in responsibility: government responsibility with public finances, personal
responsibility for our actions, and social responsibility towards each other. We believe in enterprise
and aspiration. We believe there is such a thing as society, it’s just not the same thing as the state.
Our fundamental tenet is that power should be devolved from politicians to people, from the central
to the local. Personal ambition should be set as high as is humanly possible, with no barriers put in

its way by the state. Perhaps most importantly, we believe that we are all in this together.

Everything you will find in this manifesto is built on these beliefs. They are the building blocks

of the change we want to see in every home, every street, every community, every business.

 

vii

FOREWORD

 

Our belief in responsibility with public finances is the starting point of our plan for economic
recovery and growth. We want your consent for a programme of public spending control that will
deal with Labour’s debt crisis and stop the Labour jobs tax that would kill our economic recovery.
The programme set out in this manifesto is fully costed and fully funded. Some of our proposals —
such as on school discipline — cost nothing, but require energy and leadership. Others — like
stopping Laboutr’s jobs tax — will require money, and we will make savings in other areas to pay
for them. The debt crisis is the terrible legacy that Gordon Brown is bequeathing to our country.
But fiscal responsibility needs a social conscience or it is not responsible at all: so we will not allow
the poorest people in Britain to pay an unfair price for the mistakes of some of the richest.

Nor will we allow irresponsibility in the private sector to continue unchecked. We will bring
law and order to our financial markets as a necessary step to restoring confidence. But the real
prize for Britain is to create a new economic model, one founded on investment and savings not
borrowing and debt. This economic vision reflects our belief in enterprise and aspiration. It is a
vision of a truly modern economy: one that is greener and more local. An economy where Britain
leads in science, technology and innovation. But it is founded on a determination that wealth
and opportunity must be more fairly distributed. We want to see an economy where not just our

standard of living, but everyone’s quality of life, rises steadily and sustainably.

But a nation is only really successful if it is built on a strong society. We will never deal with
our debts and build a new economy unless we solve the social problems that cost so much and hold
so many people back. Labour’s big government approach is making our social problems worse, not
better — inequality and poverty on the rise; social mobility stalled; family breakdown a fact
of life for too many children. So we need fundamental change: from big government that presumes

to know best, to the Big Society that trusts in the people for ideas and innovation.

We will move from state action to social action, encouraging social responsibility in all its
forms and across all the country — whether curbing incivility on our streets or supporting social
enterprises with the power to transform neighbourhoods. Mending Britain’s broken society will

be a central aim of the next Conservative government.

That is why in this manifesto we set ourselves an ambitious goal: to make Britain the most
family-friendly country in Europe. That is why we back the NHS. That is why we will reform
schools to raise standards and restore discipline. It is why we will get people off benefits and into

work; reform policing, sentencing and prisons. And why we are committed to a greener future.

 

viii

FOREWORD

 

But we will not succeed in building the Big Society, or in building a new economic model,
unless we stop government trying to direct everything from the centre. We will get nowhere with
yet more top-down state control. So, after thirteen years of Labour, we need radical political
reform. We need to change the whole way this country is run. As Conservatives, we trust people.
We believe that if people are given more responsibility, they will behave more responsibly. We
believe that if you decentralise power, you get better results and better value for money. So the
plans set out in this manifesto represent an unprecedented redistribution of power and control
from the central to the local, from politicians and the bureaucracy to individuals, families and
neighbourhoods.

We will give people much more say over the things that affect their daily lives. We will make
government, politics and public services much more open and transparent. And we will give the
people who work in our public services much greater responsibility. But in return, they will have
to answer to the people. All these measures will help restore trust in our broken political system.

We know that this is an ambitious vision. A profoundly optimistic vision. It is also an
authentically Conservative vision: sound money, backing enterprise, trusting people. The journey
we embarked on four and a half years ago was all about applying this Conservative approach
to the progressive challenges of our age: making opportunity more equal; fighting poverty and
inequality; improving the environment and general well-being. So our creed today is progressive

Conservatism; and this is an unashamedly progressive Conservative manifesto.

Now we ask you to join us for the next and most important stage of the journey: changing

Britain so we can offer a better life to all our citizens and play a proud and leading role in the world.

Each of the three programmes of reform outlined in this manifesto — our plans to build a new
economic model; to build the Big Society; to build a political system where people have more
power and control over their lives — is a massive undertaking in its own right. Yet we are proposing
to carry out these changes all at once, because that is the only way to put Britain on the right path
for a successful future.

Britain faces huge problems that demand radical change; and it cannot come soon enough.
We are impatient to get on with this work. We are determined to make a difference. We have the
policies to make that difference. And most importantly, we have faith in the people of Britain,
because we know that if we all pull together, stick together, then this country can change its future.

CHANGE THE ECONOMY | JNTRODUCTION

 

Get the economy moving

Gordon Brown’s debt, waste and taxes have wrecked the economy and threaten to kill the
recovery. A Conservative government will take action now to cut the deficit, stop Labour's jobs
tax, help keep mortgage rates low and get the economy moving. We will create a new economic

model built on investment and savings, not borrowing and debt.

Where is the growth going to come from? Who will provide jobs for the millions out of work?
How will families be able to aspire to a better future? These are the questions being asked about

Britain, at home and abroad.

One thing is clear. We can’t go on with the old model of an economy built on debt. Irresponsible
public spending, an overblown banking sector, and unsustainable consumer borrowing on the back
of a housing bubble were the features of an age of irresponsibility that left Britain badly exposed to
the economic crisis. Now, with the national debt already doubled and in danger of doubling again, it
is this debt — together with the jobs tax that Labour will introduce to help pay for it — that threatens

to kill the recovery.

Britain needs a new economic model. Saving and business investment must replace reckless
borrowing as the foundation of growth. We need to boost enterprise and develop a low carbon,
hi-tech economy. Our exports must grow. We need to get Britain working by creating jobs in the

private sector, and we must get better value for money from the public sector.

With the next Conservative government, our tax system, education and national infrastructure
will help British firms out-compete their global rivals, not hold them back. We will build a more
balanced economy that does not depend so heavily on the success of financial services, and where
all parts of the country share in the gains. The bedrock of this new economic model will be the
stability and low interest rates that come from a credible plan to reduce our record budget deficit,

protect Britain’s credit rating and give taxpayers value for their money.

Building this new economic model requires a national effort. We can reverse Britain’s economic
decline — but only if we accept that we are all in this together. No government, even a strong and
united one, can create a better country alone. It needs individuals, families and businesses pulling
alongside. We want to unite everyone in our country behind this bold vision of a new British

economic model.

 

 

CHANGE THE ECONOMY | BENCHMARKS FOR BRITAIN

 

Benchmarks for Britain

For the first time, the British people will have eight clear and transparent benchmarks against
which they can judge the economic success or failure of the next government. We will be
accountable and open. These are the eight Benchmarks for Britain. Achieving them over the next
Parliament will mean we have put Britain back on its feet and are building a new British economic

model, very different from the debt-driven economy of recent years.

1. Ensure macroeconomic stability: We will safeguard Britain’s credit rating with a credible plan
to eliminate the bulk of the structural deficit over a Parliament. Our fiscal policy will seek to
help keep interest rates lower for longer. The independent Bank of England will continue to
target 2 per cent Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation, and will use its new role in prudential

supervision to preserve financial stability.

2. Create a more balanced economy: We will create the conditions for higher exports, business

investment and saving as a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

3. Get Britain working again: We will reduce youth unemployment and reduce the number of

children in workless households as part of our strategy for tackling poverty and inequality.

4, Encourage enterprise: We will improve Britain’s international rankings for tax competitiveness

and business regulation.

5. Ensure the whole country shares in rising prosperity: We will increase the private sector’s share

of the economy in all regions of the country, especially outside London and the South East.

6. Reform public services to deliver better value for money: We will raise productivity growth

in the public sector in order to deliver better schools and a better NHS.

7. Create a safer banking system that serves the needs of the economy: We will reform the
regulation and structure of the banking system to ensure lower levels of leverage, less
dependence on unstable wholesale funding, and greater availability of credit for small and

medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

8. Build a greener economy: We will reduce UK greenhouse gas emissions and increase our

share of global markets for low carbon technologies.

CHANGE THE ECONOMY | ENSURE MACROECONOMIC STABILITY

 

Ensure macroeconomic stability

We will safeguard Britain's credit rating with a credible plan to eliminate the bulk of the structural

deficit over a Parliament. Our fiscal policy will help keep interest rates lower for longer. The

independent Bank of England will continue to target 2 per cent CPI inflation, and will use its new

role in prudential supervision to preserve financial stability.

After a decade of mismanagement, the UK.
entered the recession in poor shape, with the
second biggest budget deficit in the developed
world. We have been honest about the scale of
the problem, and the actions we will need to
take to deal with it. This will not be easy, but
we can overcome our problems if we all pull

together.

The absence of a credible plan to deal with our
record budget deficit, the largest of any major
economy, is creating uncertainty over Britain’s
credit rating and interest rates. This instability
undermines confidence and jeopardises
investment. It could tip Britain back into
recession. This is Gordon Brown’s legacy —
and why the greatest risk to our economic
recovery is five more years of Gordon Brown.

Urgent action to reduce debt

Urgent action is needed if we are to avoid the
higher borrowing costs that would inevitably
follow from a credit rating downgrade. So
we will cut wasteful government spending

to bring the deficit down and restore stability.

We will increase spending on health in real
terms every year and honour our commitments
on international aid, but our plan to get a grip
on the deficit will include cuts to wasteful
spending in many other departmental budgets.
That will enable the independent Bank of
England to keep interest rates as low as possible

for as long as possible.

To ensure that no Labour government can
ever attempt to bankrupt our public finances
again, we will set up an independent Office
for Budget Responsibility to restore trust in
the government’s ability to manage the public

finances.

We will provide an emergency Budget within
50 days of taking office to set out a credible
plan for eliminating the bulk of the structural
current budget deficit over a Parliament. The
case for starting early to re-establish our
economic credibility is overwhelming, and is
backed by economists and business leaders.

 

CHANGE THE ECONOMY | ENSURE MACROECONOMIC STABILITY

 

We will start by cutting a net £6 billion of
wasteful departmental spending in the financial
year 2010/11. In addition, we will make the

following savings:

* freeze public sector pay for one year in
2011, excluding the one million lowest paid

workers;

* hold a review to bring forward the date at
which the state pension age starts to rise to
66, although it will not be sooner than 2016

for men and 2020 for women;

* stop paying tax credits to better-off families

with incomes over £50,000;

* cut government contributions to Child Trust
Funds for all but the poorest third of families
and families with disabled children;

* cap public sector pensions above £50,000;

* cut Ministers’ pay by 5 per cent, followed by

a five year freeze; and,
* reduce the number of MPs by 10 per cent.

Over the course of a Parliament, we will cut
Whitehall policy, funding and regulation

costs by a third, saving £2 billion a year, and
save a further £1 billion a year from quango

bureaucracy.

Cut government waste to stop
Labour’s jobs tax

Labour are planning to increase National
Insurance in 2011. Anyone earning over
£20,000 will pay more tax, and employers

will pay more tax on all jobs paid over £5,700.
This jobs tax, which will hit small businesses
especially hard, will kill off the recovery.
Experts predict it will cost 57,000 jobs in small

and medium-sized businesses alone.

At the same time, Labour will not take action to
cut waste in government. They have identified
£11 billion pounds of waste, but they do not
plan to start dealing with it until April 2011.

So Labour will continue wasting money while

putting up taxes on working people.

We will act immediately to cut government
waste so we can stop the most damaging part of
the National Insurance rise for employers and

for anyone earning under £35,000.

We will make the following changes in April

2011, relative to Labour’s plans:

* raise the primary threshold for National
Insurance by £24 a week and raise the Upper
Earnings Limit by £29 a week; and,

* raise the secondary threshold at which
employers start paying National Insurance
by £21 a week.

 

CHANGE THE ECONOMY | ENSURE MACROECONOMIC STABILITY

 

Seven out of ten working people — those
earning between £7,100 and £45,400 — and
almost every employer will save up to £150

a year per person compared to under Labour.
Lower earners will get the greatest benefit as
a percentage of their earnings. Nobody will be

worse off as a result of these changes.

Our plans are backed by many of Britain’s top
business leaders, who between them employ
more than halfa million people, as well as by

Britain’s leading business organisations.

To pay for this we will take immediate action
to cut a net £6 billion of wasteful departmental
spending in the financial year 2010/11, with
further savings in future years. This is in
addition to the savings made by cutting tax
credits and Child Trust Funds for better-

off families.

These actions will allow us to reduce the
deficit more quickly than Labour year-on-year
while avoiding the most damaging part of
their jobs tax. It will also lower the proportion
of the reduction of the structural deficit that

is accounted for by tax increases, from about
one third towards one fifth. This is in line
with international best practice, as well as the

Treasury’s own internal analysis.

Former government advisers Sir Peter Gershon
and Dr Martin Read have advised us that
savings of £12 billion across all departmental

spending are possible in-year without affecting

the quality of frontline services. These are
over and above any savings already planned by

Labour. We will achieve this through:

* a freeze on major new Information and
Communications Technologies (ICT)
spending;

* immediate negotiations to achieve cost

reductions from major suppliers;
* tighter control of public sector recruitment;

* reductions in discretionary spending,
including travel, expenses, advertising,

consultancy and office supplies; and,
* reductions in public sector property costs.

We will match Labour’s spending plans for
2010/11 in health and overseas aid. Given our
commitment to carry out a Strategic Defence
and Security Review, it would also not be
appropriate to make in-year reductions to the
existing defence budget in 2010/11. Savings

in these protected areas will be channelled
back into frontline services. The net £6 billion
of savings will be made from the remaining

departmental budgets.

CHANGE THE ECONOMY | CREATE A MORE BALANCED ECONOMY

 

Create a more balanced economy

We will create the conditions for higher exports, business investment and saving as a share of GDP.

For the last decade, growth has been too
dependent on government spending and debt-
fuelled consumption. More than half of the new
jobs created were driven by public spending.
Household savings collapsed, and the UK has
the lowest investment as a share of GDP of

any G7 country. Our share of world exports

has fallen by almost a third. A sustainable
recovery must be driven by growth in exports
and business investment, and through a better

environment for wealth creation.

Make Britain the leading hi-tech
exporter in Europe

We will implement key recommendations from
Sir James Dyson’s Review into how to achieve
our goal of making Britain Europe’s leading

hi-tech exporter, including:

* encouraging the establishment of
joint university-business research and

development institutes;

* initiating a multi-year Science and Research
Budget to provide a stable investment climate

for Research Councils;

* creating a better focus on Science,
Technology, Engineering and Maths
(STEM) subjects in schools; and,

* establishing a new prize for engineering.

Research and development tax credits will be
improved and refocused on hi-tech companies,
small businesses and new start-ups. At the
same time, we will give strong backing to the
growth industries that generate high-quality

jobs around the country.

We will improve the performance of UK

Trade and Investment with a renewed focus

on high priority sectors and markets where

the return on taxpayers’ money is highest. We
will regularly compare government support for
exporters and inward investment against the
services provided by our competitors. We will
work for the successful conclusion of the Doha
trade round and support bilateral free trade
negotiations between the European Union (EU)

and other countries.

 

11

CHANGE THE ECONOMY | CREATE A MORE BALANCED ECONOMY

 

Encourage saving and
investment

Only by saving more can we finance
investment for the future without being
dependent on unsustainable inflows of capital
from abroad. We will help stop the spread of
means-testing by restoring the link between
the basic state pension and average earnings,
making it worthwhile for people to save. Other
measures we will take to encourage saving

include:

* reinvigorating occupational pensions and
working with employers and industry to

support auto-enrolment into pensions;

* working with the trade unions, businesses
and others to address the growing disparity
between public sector pensions and private
sector pensions, while protecting accrued

rights; and,

* when resources allow, starting to reverse the
effects of the abolition of the dividend tax

credit for pension funds.

We will reward those who have saved for
their retirement by ending the effective
obligation to buy an annuity at age 75. And
we will raise the inheritance tax threshold

to £1 million to help millions of people who
aspire to pass something on to their children,
paid for by a simple flat-rate levy on all
non-domiciled individuals.

We must not let the mis-selling of financial
products put people off saving. We will
implement the Ombudsman’s recommendation
to make fair and transparent payments to
Equitable Life policy holders, through an
independent payment scheme, for their relative

loss as a consequence of regulatory failure.

Help households manage their
debts

Going into the recession, Britain’s consumer
debt was the highest in the G7. A Conservative
government will promote responsible consumer
finance by creating a powerful Consumer
Protection Agency (CPA) to take over the
Financial Services Authority’s consumer

protection role. In addition, we will:

* give the CPA new powers to define and ban

excessive borrowing rates on store cards;

* launch Britain’s first free national financial
advice service, funded in full through a
new social responsibility levy on the

financial services sector;

* introduce a seven-day cooling off period
for store cards;

* require credit card companies to provide

clear information; and,

* ensure that no-one is forced to sell their
home to pay unsecured debts of less
than £25,000.

CHANGE THE ECONOMY | GET BRITAIN WORKING AGAIN

 

Get Britain working again

We will reduce youth unemployment and reduce the number of children in workless households as

part of our strategy for tackling poverty and inequality.

Under Labour, youth unemployment has
reached over 900,000, with one in five

young people unable to find a job. We are at
risk of creating a lost generation of young
people without the skills to participate in the
workforce, without hope for the future. At the
same time, economic inactivity is rising, and
more than five million people are out of work

and on benefits.

This tidal wave of worklessness is making it
hard for many families to make ends meet. In
recent years, the number of people living in
severe poverty has risen. One in six children in
the UK now lives in a workless household — the
highest proportion of any country in Europe —
and child poverty has gone up in recent years.
Getting people back into work is an essential
part of realising the goal of eliminating child
poverty by 2020, and ensuring that everyone

benefits from economic growth.

Reduce welfare dependency

We will scrap Labour’s failing employment
schemes and create a single Work Programme
for everyone who is unemployed, including the

2.6 million people claiming Incapacity

Benefit who do not get enough help from
existing programmes. We will reassess all
current claimants of Incapacity Benefit.

Those found fit for work will be transferred
onto Jobseeker’s Allowance. Recipients of
Incapacity Benefit who are genuinely disabled
will continue to receive the financial support to
which they are entitled. Our Work Programme

will:

+ offer people targeted, personalised help
sooner — straight away for those with serious
barriers to work and at six months for those

aged under 25;

* be delivered through private and voluntary
sector providers, which will be rewarded on
a payment by results basis for getting people

into sustainable work;

* draw on a range of Service Academies
to offer pre-employment training for
unemployed people — our first Service
Academy, for hospitality and leisure, will
provide up to 50,000 training places and

work placements; and,

 

15

CHANGE THE ECONOMY | GET BRITAIN WORKING AGAIN

 

* involve the development of local Work
Clubs — places where people looking
for work can gather together to exchange
skills, find opportunities, make useful

contacts and provide mutual support.

Our plans will give unemployed people a hand
up, not a hand out. Unemployed people must
be prepared to take up job offers. So, with the
Conservatives, long-term benefit claimants
who fail to find work will be required to ‘work
for the dole’ on community work programmes.
Anyone on Jobseeker’s Allowance who refuses
to join the Work Programme will lose the right
to claim out-of-work benefits until they do,
while people who refuse to accept reasonable
job offers could forfeit their benefits for up to
three years. This will create a welfare system
that is fair but firm.

Boost small business

In the end, it is not the state that creates
sustainable employment — it is business people.
And small businesses are especially important
to the UK’s economic recovery and to tackling
unemployment. Government can help boost
enterprise by lowering tax rates, reducing

regulation and improving workers’ skills.

As well as stopping Laboutr’s jobs tax, for the
first two years of a Conservative government
any new business will pay no Employers
National Insurance on the first ten employees it
hires during its first year.

To support small businesses further, we will:

* make small business rate relief automatic;

and,

* aim to deliver 25 per cent of government
research and procurement contracts through
SMEs by cutting the administrative costs of
bidding.

We will support would-be entrepreneurs
through a new programme — Work for Yourself
— which will give unemployed people direct
access to business mentors and substantial
loans. We need to make work pay, so we will
keep the minimum wage and work to reduce
the very high marginal tax rates faced by many
people on low incomes who want to return to
work or increase their earnings. We will look
at how to abolish the default retirement age, as
many older people want to carry on working.
And we will force equal pay audits on any
company found to be discriminating on the

basis of gender.

Improve skills and strengthen
higher education

Developing economies are able to provide
highly-skilled work at a fraction of the cost
of British labour. The only way we can
compete is by dramatically improving the
skills of Britain’s workforce, yet thousands
of young people leave school every year
without the skills they need to get a good

 

16

CHANGE THE ECONOMY | GET BRITAIN WORKING AGAIN

 

job. A Conservative government will not
accept another generation being consigned
to an uncertain future of worklessness and

dependency.

We will promote fair access to universities,

the professions, and good jobs for young people
from all backgrounds. We will use funding
that currently supports Labour’s ineffective
employment and training schemes, such as
Train2Gain, to provide our own help for people
looking to improve their skills. This will allow

us to:

* create 400,000 work pairing, apprenticeship,

college and training places over two years;

* give SMEs a £2,000 bonus for every
apprentice they hire;

* establish a Community Learning Fund to

help people restart their careers; and,

* create a new all-age careers service so that

everyone can access the advice they need.

To meet the skills challenge we face, the
training sector needs to be given the freedom
to innovate. We will set colleges free from
direct state control and abolish many of the
further education quangos Labour have put in
place. Public funding will follow the choices of
students and be delivered by a single agency,

the Further Education Funding Council.

Universities contribute enormously to the
economy. But not all of this contribution comes
directly — it can come from fundamental
research with no immediate application — and
universities also have a crucial cultural role.
We will ensure that Britain’s universities enjoy
the freedom to pursue academic excellence
and focus on raising the quality of the student

experience. To enable this to happen, we will:

* delay the implementation of the Research
Excellence Framework so that it can be
reviewed — because of doubts about whether
there is a robust and acceptable way of

measuring the impact of all research;

* consider carefully the results of Lord
Browne’s review into the future of higher
education funding, so that we can unlock
the potential of universities to transform our
economy, to enrich students’ lives through
teaching of the highest quality, and to

advance scholarship; and,

* provide 10,000 extra university places this
year, paid for by giving graduates incentives
to pay back their student loans early on an

entirely voluntary basis.

Silicon Valley

Despite having a population twenty times smaller than the UK, Silicon Valley is a global
beacon for innovation and enterprise, attracting more venture capital investment than
the whole of the UK. Having led the internet revolution, Silicon Valley is now becoming
a world leader in green technology development. These successes are thanks to the
highly skilled workforce and world-class universities, the ease of starting a business, and
the availability of credit and investment. In addition, companies in Silicon Valley have
been able to attract employees in a highly competitive labour market by introducing
measures to improve the general well-being of their staff, including flexible working and
childcare facilities.

 

CHANGE THE ECONOMY | ENCOURAGE ENTERPRISE

 

Encourage enterprise

We will improve Britain’s international rankings for tax competitiveness and business regulation.

Thirteen years ago, Britain’s tax system was
one of the most competitive in the developed
world. Over the last decade, other countries
have cut their tax rates while our tax system has
become one of the most complex in the world.
Our competitiveness rating has fallen, while the
burden of regulation and the impact of taxation
have risen. We can only make a sustainable
economic recovery if we send a clear signal that
Britain is open for business again. That means
stopping Labour’s jobs tax, lowering corporate
tax rates, reducing the regulatory burden,

and supporting innovation and sustainable
development — changes that will benefit

businesses of all sizes and boost employment.

Cut and simplify business taxes

The Conservative Party believes in lower and
simpler taxation. That is why we will ensure
that by far the largest part of the burden of
dealing with the deficit falls on lower spending
rather than higher taxes. Cutting the deficit is
the most urgent task we need to undertake if
we are to get the economy moving, but it is not
enough. So, initially, we will cut the headline
rate of corporation tax to 25p and the small
companies’ rate to 20p, funded by reducing

complex reliefs and allowances.

Over time, we hope to reduce these rates
further. Our ambition is to create the most
competitive tax system in the G20 within

five years.

We will restore the tax system’s reputation for
simplicity, stability and predictability. In our
first Budget, we will set out a five year road
map for the direction of corporate tax reform,
providing greater certainty and stability to
businesses. We will create an independent
Office of Tax Simplification to suggest reforms

to the tax system.

We will take a series of measures to encourage
Foreign Direct Investment into the UK,

including:

* making the UK a more attractive location for
multinationals by simplifying the complex

Controlled Foreign Companies rules;

consulting on moving towards a territorial
corporate tax system that only taxes profits

generated in the UK; and,

creating an attractive tax environment for
intellectual property.

 

19

CHANGE THE ECONOMY | ENCOURAGE ENTERPRISE

 

Reduce regulation

Increasing amounts of red tape and complex
regulation have eroded Britain’s reputation

as a good place to invest, create jobs or start

a business. A Conservative government will
introduce regulatory budgets: forcing any
government body wanting to introduce a new
regulation to reduce regulation elsewhere by a
greater amount. And we will give the public the
opportunity to force the worst regulations to be

repealed.

To encourage new businesses to start up, we
will reduce the number of forms needed to
register a new business — moving towards a
‘one-click’ registration model — to make Britain
the fastest place in the world to start a business,
and end the restrictions on social tenants

starting a business from their homes.

We are proud of the last Conservative
government’s industrial relations reforms,
which helped bring about our economic revival
in the 1980s, and we will always be prepared to

build on them if necessary.

Support innovation and
sustainable development

Government procurement is a £200 billion a
year market that can be used much better to
stimulate enterprise and innovation. We will
take steps to open up government procurement
to small and innovative businesses by:

* publishing online all government tender
documents for contracts worth over £10,000

via the Supply2Gov website;

* creating a level playing field for open source

ICT in government procurement; and,

* opening up contracts to SMEs by breaking
up large ICT projects into smaller
components.

Britain’s complex and unwieldy planning
system has long been cited as a significant
barrier to growth and wealth creation. We will
create a presumption in favour of sustainable
development in the planning system. We will
abolish the unelected Infrastructure Planning
Commission (IPC) and replace it with an
efficient and democratically-accountable
system that provides a fast-track process for

major infrastructure projects. We will:

* use private or hybrid Bills to promote major
projects, such as our plans for a national high

speed rail network;

* ensure that all other major infrastructure
projects are considered at planning inquiries
which have binding timetables and which
focus on planning issues — with final

permission given by a Minister; and,

* provide transitional arrangements for projects
already before the IPC to ensure that these

projects are not disrupted or delayed.

 

CHANGE THE ECONOMY | ENCOURAGE ENTERPRISE

 

Attract the brightest and best to
our country

Immigration has enriched our nation over the
years and we want to attract the brightest and
the best people who can make a real difference
to our economic growth. But immigration
today is too high and needs to be reduced. We
do not need to attract people to do jobs that
could be carried out by British citizens, given
the right training and support. So we will take
steps to take net migration back to the levels
of the 1990s — tens of thousands a year, not

hundreds of thousands.

To help achieve this goal, we will introduce a

number of measures, such as:

* setting an annual limit on the number of non-
EU economic migrants admitted into the UK

to live and work;

+ limiting access only to those who will bring
the most value to the British economy; and,

* applying transitional controls as a matter of
course in the future for all new EU Member
States.

In addition, we will promote integration into
British society, as we believe that everyone
coming to this country must be ready to
embrace our core values and become a part
of their local community. So there will be an
English language test for anyone coming here

to get married.

We want to encourage students to come to our
universities and colleges, but our student visa
system has become the biggest weakness in our
border controls. A Conservative government
will strengthen the system of granting student
visas so that it is less open to abuse. We want
to make it easier for reputable universities and
colleges to accept applications, while putting
extra scrutiny on new institutions looking to
accept foreign students or existing institutions
not registered with Companies House. In

addition, we will:

* insist foreign students at new or unregistered
institutions pay a bond in order to study in
this country, to be repaid after the student

has left the country at the end of their studies;

* ensure foreign students can prove that
they have the financial means to support

themselves in the UK; and,

* require that students must usually leave the
country and reapply if they want to switch

to another course or apply for a work permit.

CHANGE THE ECONOMY

ENSURE THE WHOLE COUNTRY SHARES IN

RISING PROSPERITY

 

Ensure the whole country shares in rising prosperity

We will increase the private sector’s share of the economy in all regions of the country, especially

outside London and the South East.

Too many areas of the UK lack a vibrant
private sector and are too dependent on public
spending. These regional imbalances have got
worse over the last decade, despite billions of
pounds spent by the Regional Development
Agencies (RDAs). Our aim is to increase the
private sector’s share of the economy in every
part of the country by boosting enterprise and
creating a better business environment. We
will work closely with local government, and
with the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly
and Northern Ireland Assembly, to achieve

this goal.

Create a modern transport
network

A rebalanced economy requires an extensive
and reliable infrastructure. But transport has
been a low priority for Labour, and the hassle
of getting around is bad for business, bad for

families and bad for everyone’s quality of life.

A Conservative government will begin work
immediately to create a high speed rail line
connecting London and Heathrow with
Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. This is
the first step towards achieving our vision of

creating a national high speed rail network to

join up major cities across England, Scotland
and Wales. Stage two will deliver two new lines
bringing the North East, Scotland and Wales

into the high speed rail network.

Because travel abroad is so important for

our economy and for family holidays, we
need to improve our airports and reduce the
environmental impact of flying. Our goal is

to make Heathrow airport better, not bigger.
We will stop the third runway and instead
link Heathrow directly to our high speed rail
network, providing an alternative to thousands

of flights. In addition, we will:

* block plans for second runways at Stansted

and Gatwick; and,

* reform Air Passenger Duty to encourage a

switch to fuller and cleaner planes.

To improve life for commuters and encourage
people to switch to lower carbon public
transport, we will reform our railways to
provide a better focus on tackling problems
that matter most to passengers, such as
overcrowding. We will grant longer, more
flexible rail franchises to incentivise private
sector investment in improvements like longer

trains and better stations.

 

23

CHANGE THE ECONOMY

ENSURE THE WHOLE COUNTRY SHARES IN

RISING PROSPERITY

 

We support Crossrail and the electrification of
the Great Western line to South Wales. We will
turn the rail regulator into a powerful passenger
champion and reform Network Rail to make it
more accountable to its customers. And we will
introduce a moratorium on building on disused
rail lines still in public ownership, so they are

available to be re-opened.

Britain has the chance to lead the world in
making our transport system greener. So we
will introduce incentives for electricity network
operators to establish a new national car
recharging network, making it much easier

for drivers to move to electric and plug-in
hybrid vehicles. We will support sustainable
travel initiatives that work best for local

communities by:

.

giving the concerns of cyclists much

greater priority;

encouraging partnerships between

bus operators and local authorities; and,

helping people cut down on work-related

travel.

We will stop central government funding

for new fixed speed cameras, and switch to
more effective ways to make our roads safer,
including authorising ‘drugalyser’ technology
for use in testing for drug-driving. We

will make companies that dig up our roads
accountable for the congestion they cause and

crack down on rogue clampers. Councils will

get more powers to get traffic flowing more

smoothly.

We will consult on the introduction of a ‘Fair
Fuel Stabiliser’. This would cut fuel duty
when oil prices rise, and vice versa. It would
ensure families, businesses and the whole
British economy are less exposed to volatile
oil markets, and that there is a more stable

environment for low carbon investment.

Spread prosperity

We want Britain to become a European hub

for hi-tech, digital and creative industries —

but this can only happen if we have the right
infrastructure in place. Establishing a super-
fast broadband network throughout the UK
could generate 600,000 additional jobs and add
£18 billion to Britain’s GDP.

We will scrap Labour’s phone tax and instead
require BT and other infrastructure providers
to allow the use of their assets to deliver super-
fast broadband across the country. If necessary,
we will consider using the part of the licence
fee that is supporting the digital switchover to
fund broadband in areas that the market alone

will not reach.

We will give councils and businesses the power
to form their own business-led local enterprise
partnerships instead of RDAs. Where local
councils and businesses want to maintain

regionally-based enterprise partnerships, they

 

24

CHANGE THE ECONOMY | ENSURE THE WHOLE COUNTRY SHARES IN
RISING PROSPERITY

 

will be able to. Local government should be at

the heart of our economic recovery, so we will:

* allow councils to keep above-average
increases in business rate revenue so that
communities which go for growth can reap
the benefits;

* give councils new powers to introduce
further discounts on business rates; and,

* introduce an immediate freeze of, and
inquiry into, the Government’s punitive
programme of back-dating business rates
on ports.

CHANGE THE ECONOMY | REFORM PUBLIC SERVICES TO DELIVER
BETTER VALUE FOR MONEY

 

Reform public services to deliver better value for money

We will raise productivity growth in the public sector in order to deliver better schools

and a better NHS.

Public sector productivity has fallen under
Labour, acting as a drag on growth and
reducing the quality of our public services.

If productivity in the public sector had grown
at the same rate as in private sector services,
we could now have the same quality of public
services for £60 billion less each year. So, by
improving public sector productivity while
getting a grip on the debt, we will still be
able to deliver better public services. That

is why good government costs less with the

Conservatives.

Decentralisation, accountability
and transparency

We value the work of those employed in

our public services, and a Conservative
government will work with them to deliver
higher productivity and better value for
money for taxpayers. We will raise public
sector productivity by increasing diversity of
provision, extending payment by results and

giving more power to consumers.

Giving public sector workers ownership of the
services they deliver is a powerful way to drive
efficiency, so we will support co-operatives and
mutualisation as a way of transferring public

assets and revenue streams to public sector

workers. We will encourage them to come
together to form employee-led co-operatives
and bid to take over the services they run. This
will empower millions of public sector workers
to become their own boss and help them to
deliver better services — the most significant
shift in power from the state to working people

since the sale of council houses in the 1980s.

Transparency is crucial to creating a value for
money culture. We will publish all items of
spending over £25,000 online, and the salaries
of senior civil servants in central government
will also be published. We will create strong
financial discipline at all levels of government
and place an obligation to manage taxpayers”
money wisely at the heart of civil service

employment contracts. In addition, we will:

introduce and publish a standard set of cost
measures that capture the key drivers of

departmental spending;

help departmental Finance Directors to

manage resources more efficiently;

implement clear financial performance

targets for senior civil servants; and,

create a focus on delivering strong financial

management across government.

CHANGE THE ECONOMY |CREATE A SAFER BANKING SYSTEM THAT SERVES
THE NEEDS OF THE ECONOMY

 

Create a safer banking system that serves the needs of the economy

We will reform the regulation and structure of the banking system to ensure lower levels of leverage,

less dependence on unstable wholesale funding, and greater availability of credit for SMEs.

In the run up to the financial crisis, British
banks became amongst the most indebted and
most leveraged in the world — with disastrous
consequences for us all. This credit boom
turned into a bust, with a significant fall in
credit available to firms. Lack of access to
credit remains a major problem, especially for
SMEs. We need to change the way we regulate
our banks to stop a crisis on this scale ever

happening again.

Reform financial services

The financial services sector is one of our most
globally successful industries, and we want

the City to be the leading location for global
finance. But the financial sector must not put the

stability of the whole economy at risk.

We will put in place a levy on banks. We are
prepared to act unilaterally if necessary, but
there is emerging international agreement
on this approach and the US and German
governments have both announced similar
plans.

We need fundamental reform of our
failed regulatory system, avoiding badly-
designed regulations that will damage our

competitiveness and ensuring that the financial

sector can supply the affordable credit that
businesses need.

We will abolish Gordon Brown’s failed tripartite
system of regulation and put the Bank of England
in charge of prudential supervision. We will
restore the Bank’s historic role in monitoring

the overall growth of credit and debt in the

economy. In addition, we will:

pursue international agreement to prevent
retail banks from engaging in activities, such
as large-scale proprietary trading, that put

the stability of the system at risk;

empower the Bank of England to crack

down on risky bonus arrangements;

increase competition in the banking industry,
starting with a study of competition in the
sector to inform our strategy for selling the

government’s stakes in the banks; and,

as the government comes to sell off its holdings
in the banks, offer a ‘people’s bank bonus’, so
that everybody in the country has the chance

to buy a stake in the state-owned banks.

We will create more diverse sources of affordable
credit for small businesses, building on our

proposals for a National Loan Guarantee Scheme.

CHANGE THE ECONOMY | BUILD A GREENER ECONOMY

 

Build a greener economy

We will reduce UK greenhouse gas emissions and increase our share of global markets for low

carbon technologies.

Labour have said the right things on climate
change, but these have proved little more than
warm words. Despite three White Papers,

a multitude of strategies and endless new
announcements, the UK now gets more of its
energy from fossil fuels than it did in 1997. Our
performance on emissions has been criticised
by environmental groups and we have the worst
record of any major EU nation when it comes

to renewable energy. This must change to

safeguard Britain and the world’s future.

We need to cut our carbon emissions to tackle
the challenge of climate change. But the

low carbon economy also provides exciting
opportunities for British businesses. We will
encourage private sector investment to put
Britain at the forefront of the green technology
revolution, creating jobs and new businesses

across the country.

Create a low carbon future

This wave of low carbon innovation we want
to unleash requires investment, so we will
create Britain’s first Green Investment Bank

— which will draw together money currently
divided across existing government initiatives,
leveraging private sector capital to finance

new green technology start-ups. We will create

green Individual Savings Accounts to help
provide the financial backing we need to create

a low carbon economy.

A credible and sustainable price for carbon

is vital if we are to see adequate and timely
investment in new electricity generation.
Whatever the carbon content of electricity
generated, operators considering new
investments in projects with a life of several
decades need to know where they stand. We
will reform the Climate Change Levy to
provide a floor price for carbon, delivering
the right climate for investment in low carbon

energy production.

We will increase the proportion of tax revenues
accounted for by environmental taxes, ensuring
that any additional revenues from new green
taxes that are principally designed as an
environmental measure to change behaviour
are used to reduce the burden of taxation

elsewhere.

 

 

 

Change society

 

   
   

THERE IS
SUCH A
THING AS
SOCIETY

CHANGE SOCIETY | INTRODUCTION

 

Mend our broken society

Our society is broken, but together we can mend it: we can build the Big Society. A Conservative
government will make Britain the most family-friendly country in Europe. We will back the NHS,
which matters more to families than anything. We will reform education, with new schools — and
higher standards and improved discipline for all. We will tackle welfare dependency and the

causes of poverty, and fight back against crime.

Despite Labour’s massive expansion of the state, many people’s quality of life is getting worse,
not better. The number of people living in poverty has risen in the last three years, and inequality
is at a record high. We have some of the worst rates of family breakdown in the world. In some
of the most deprived parts of the country, life expectancy has actually fallen. The achievement

gap at school between the richest and poorest is growing.

This terrible record of failure is not just a problem that affects our society and ruins people’s
lives. It affects our economy too, costing billions and wasting potential. It is the result of a political
approach that addresses the symptoms, rather than the underlying causes, of social breakdown;

one that relies on top-down government intervention and bureaucratic micro-management.

So we need a new approach: social responsibility, not state control; the Big Society, not big
government. Only in this way will we tackle the causes of poverty and inequality, rather than just
the symptoms. Only in this way will we transform the quality of our public services. And only in

this way will we rebuild shattered communities and repair the torn fabric of society.

So we will redistribute power from the central state to individuals, families and local
communities. We will give public sector workers back their professional autonomy. They will
be accountable to the people they serve and the results they achieve will be made transparent. If
people don’t like the service they receive they will be able to choose better alternatives. In this way,
we will create opportunities for people to take power and control over their lives. Our approach is

absolutely in line with the spirit of the age: the post-bureaucratic age.

This vision demands a cultural change across the country. Our success will depend not just on
the actions we take but on society’s response. By promoting equality and tackling discrimination,
our policies, like recognising civil partnerships as well as marriage in the tax system and helping
disabled people live independently, will give everybody the chance to play their part. This way,

we can make Britain fairer and safer; a country where opportunity is more equal.

 

35

 

CHANGE SOCIETY | BUILD THE BIG SOCIETY

 

Build the Big Society

We will use the state to help stimulate social action, helping social enterprises to deliver public

services and training new community organisers to help achieve our ambition of every adult

citizen being a member of an active neighbourhood group. We will direct funding to those groups

that strengthen communities in deprived areas, and we will introduce National Citizen Service,

initially for 16 year olds, to help bring our country together.

The size, scope and role of government in

the UK has reached a point where it is now
inhibiting, not advancing, the progressive aims
of reducing poverty, fighting inequality, and
increasing general well-being. We can’t go on

pretending that government has all the answers.

Our alternative to big government is the Big
Society: a society with much higher levels of
personal, professional, civic and corporate
responsibility; a society where people come
together to solve problems and improve life

for themselves and their communities; a society
where the leading force for progress is social
responsibility, not state control.

The Big Society runs consistently through
our policy programme. Our plans to reform
public services, mend our broken society,
and rebuild trust in politics are all part of

our Big Society agenda. These plans involve
redistributing power from the state to society;
from the centre to local communities, giving
people the opportunity to take more control

over their lives.

But we recognise that it is not enough to create
opportunities for people to get involved in
building the Big Society; our reform plans
require a social response in order to be
successful. So building the Big Society is not
just a question of the state stepping back and
hoping for the best: it will require an active
role for the state. The state must take action

to agitate for, catalyse and galvanise social
renewal. We must use the state to help

remake society.

Public service reform

Our public service reform programme will
enable social enterprises, charities and
voluntary groups to play a leading role in
delivering public services and tackling

deep-rooted social problems.

We will strengthen and support social
enterprises to help deliver our public service
reforms by creating a Big Society Bank, funded
from unclaimed bank assets, to provide

new finance for neighbourhood groups,
charities, social enterprises and other non-

governmental bodies.

 

37

CHANGE SOCIETY | BUILD THE BIG SOCIETY

 

This will provide social enterprises with the
start-up funding and support they need to

bid for government contracts or work towards
delivering services under a payment by

results model.

Britain has a proud and long-standing
charitable tradition, and we are convinced

that the voluntary sector should play a major
part in our civic renewal. We will introduce

a fair deal on grants to give voluntary sector
organisations more stability and allow them to
earn a competitive return for providing public
services. We will work with local authorities to
promote the delivery of public services by social

enterprises, charities and the voluntary sector.

Neighbourhood groups

Our reform agenda is designed to empower
communities to come together to address local
issues. For example, we will enable parents

to start new schools, empower communities

to take over local amenities such as parks

and libraries that are under threat, give
neighbourhoods greater control of the planning
system, and enable residents to hold the police
to account in neighbourhood beat meetings.
These policies will give new powers and rights
to neighbourhood groups: the ‘little platoons’
of civil society — and the institutional building
blocks of the Big Society.

Our ambition is for every adult in the country
to be a member of an active neighbourhood
group. We will stimulate the creation and
development of neighbourhood groups, which
can take action to improve their local area. We
will use Cabinet Office budgets to fund the
training of independent community organisers
to help people establish and run neighbourhood
groups, and provide neighbourhood grants to
the UK’s poorest areas to ensure they play a

leading role in the rebuilding of civic society.
To stimulate social action further, we will:

* transform the civil service into a ‘civic
service’ by making sure that participation
in social action is recognised in civil

servants’ appraisals;

launch an annual Big Society Day to
celebrate the work of neighbourhood groups
and encourage more people to take part

in social action;

provide funding from the Big Society Bank
to intermediary bodies with a track record
of supporting and growing social enterprises;

and,

develop a measure of well-being that

encapsulates the social value of state action.

 

38

CHANGE SOCIETY | BUILD THE BIG SOCIETY

 

National Citizen Service

Building the Big Society means encouraging
the concept of public-spirited service — the idea
that everyone should play a part in making their

communities stronger.

That is why we will introduce National Citizen
Service. The initial flagship project will provide
a programme for 16 year olds to give them a
chance to develop the skills needed to be active
and responsible citizens, mix with people

from different backgrounds, and start getting

involved in their communities.

Even in these difficult times, the British people
have demonstrated their desire to give money
and time to good causes. We will introduce
new ways to increase philanthropy, and use the
latest insights from behavioural economics to
encourage people to make volunteering and
community participation something they do

on a regular basis.

The National Lottery

We will restore the National Lottery to its
original purpose and, by cutting down on
administration costs, make sure more money
goes to good causes. The Big Lottery Fund

will focus purely on supporting social action
through the voluntary and community sector,
instead of Ministers’ pet projects as at present.
Sports, heritage and the arts will each see their
original allocations of 20 per cent of good cause

money restored.

Sport and the Olympics

We will deliver a successful Olympics that
brings lasting benefits for the country as a
whole. Part of the community sports budget
of the National Lottery will be responsible
for delivering an Olympic legacy, including
the vigorous promotion of competitive sports
through a national Olympic-style school
competition. To support high-level sport
further, we will:

* work with the Scottish government to deliver
a top-quality Commonwealth Games in
Glasgow in 2014;

ensure that the 2013 Rugby League and
the 2015 Rugby Union World Cups are

successful; and,

strongly support England’s bid to host the
2018 Football World Cup.

 

39

Every summer for the past three years, the Conservative Party has been running
“Project Umubano’ in Rwanda. Over that period, Conservative MPs and volunteers
have provided English lessons to 3,000 Rwandan primary school teachers,
renovated a school, established a small medical library at Kirambi Health Centre,
and built a community centre. Project Umubano is a sign of our commitment to One
World Conservatism, and our belief in the positive power of social action.

 

PROMOTE OUR NATIONAL INTEREST | ONE WORLD CONSERVATISM

 

One World Conservatism

We will honour our commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income in aid, and ensure our

aid is transparent and properly targeted. We will spend at least £500 million a year to tackle

malaria. Both the British people and those who receive aid will get more control over how it is

spent. We will push for a trade deal which brings growth to the poorest countries, helps those

countries adapt to climate change, and puts in place the building blocks of wealth creation.

The global downturn has shaken up rich and
poor countries alike. For poor countries, it
threatens to undermine a decade’s growth and
poverty reduction. For rich countries, it puts
new pressures on household and government
budgets — nowhere more so than in the UK,
where Labour’s appalling mismanagement

of the economy has saddled us with
unprecedented levels of debt. But we should
use this opportunity to reaffirm, not abandon,
our values — which is why we will continue to
increase the level of British aid. We will do so
because it is in our national interest, as well
as being the right thing to do.

Deliver on our commitment to
the world’s poorest nations

A new Conservative government will be fully
committed to achieving, by 2013, the UN target
of spending 0.7 per cent of national income

as aid. We will stick to the rules laid down by
the OECD about what spending counts as aid.
We will legislate in the first session of a new
Parliament to lock in this level of spending for

every year from 2013.

We support the Millennium Development
Goals and will continue to work towards them.
We will maintain an independent Department
for International Development (DFID) and keep
aid untied from commercial interests.

We will be completely transparent about the
cost and performance of DFID programmes by
independently evaluating programmes and by
introducing, where appropriate, payment

by results.

Our bargain with taxpayers is this: in return
for contributing your hard-earned money to
helping the world’s poorest people, it is our
duty to spend every penny of aid effectively.
We will ensure British aid money is properly
spent by publishing full details of British aid
on the DFID website. This will include
spending data on a project-by-project basis,
published in an open and standardised format
so that it can be used by third party websites.
In addition, we will work to bring about
improved transparency of aid spending by

other development organisations.

 

117

PROMOTE OUR NATIONAL INTEREST | ONE WORLD CONSERVATISM

 

We will create a new MyAid Fund to allow
British people a direct say on aid spending, as
well as giving people in developing countries
more say over how aid is spent in their

communities.

Under Labour, our aid funding is not used

in a focused way, and is sometimes spent in
countries that should be looking after their
own poor citizens. So we will stop giving aid
to China and Russia and review which other
countries should get British aid. We will focus
more on the poorest, paying particular attention
to development within the Commonwealth.

A key aim of our aid is to make sure everyone
gets access to the basics: clean water,
sanitation, healthcare and education. We will
focus particularly on the rights of women,
children and disabled people to access these
services. Malaria continues to kill nearly a
million people per year, despite the fact that it
is easily preventable and treatable. So, as part
of our commitment to increase aid funding, a
Conservative government will spend at least
£500 million per year tackling malaria and will
strongly support efforts to develop a malaria

vaccine.

Trade and economic growth are the only
sustainable way for developing countries to
escape poverty, which is why we will put
maximum effort into achieving an ambitious,
pro-development global trade deal. Our aid

programme will help poor countries put in

place the building blocks of wealth creation:
property rights, effective public services,

stability and the rule of law.

We will provide a more integrated approach
to post-conflict reconstruction where the
British military is involved — building on the
Stabilisation Unit in Whitehall and creating

a new Stabilisation and Reconstruction Force
to bridge the gap between the military and the
reconstruction effort.

To help deliver on our commitment to

developing countries, we will:

* establish a Poverty Impact Fund to support
innovative and effective British poverty-
fighting groups which do not currently

qualify for government funding;

explore ways to help the very poorest
developing countries take part in
international climate change negotiations,

and work to make our aid ‘climate-smart’;

end Labour’s use of the Export Credit
Guarantee Department to support investment
in dirty fossil fuel power stations, and instead
use it to help spread new green energy

technology to developing countries; and,

encourage the establishment of a Pan-African
Free Trade Area, which has the potential to
transform that continent’s economies.
