1906 Labour Party General
Election Manifesto

 

This election is to decide whether or not Labour is to be fairly represented in
Parliament.

The House of Commons is supposed to be the people's House, and yet the
people are not there.

Landlords, employers, lawyers, brewers, and financiers are there in force.
Why not Labour?

The Trade Unions ask the same liberty as capital enjoys. They are refused.
The aged poor are neglected.

The slums remain; overcrowding continues, whilst the land goes to waste.
Shopkeepers and traders are overburdened with rates and taxation, whilst the
increasing land values, which should relieve the ratepayers, go to people

who have not earned them.

Wars are fought to make the rich richer, and underfed schoolchildren are still
neglected.

Chinese Labour is defended because it enriches the mine owners.

The unemployed ask for work, the Government gave them a worthless Act,
and now, when you are beginning to understand the causes of your poverty,
the red herring of Protection is drawn across your path.

Protection, as experience shows, is no remedy for poverty and
unemployment. It serves to keep you from dealing with the land, housing,
old age, and other social problems!

You have it in your power to see that Parliament carries out your wishes. The
Labour Representation-Executive appeals to you in the name of a million
Trade Unionists to forget all the political differences which have kept you
apart in the past, and vote for [candidate name].

January 1910 Labour Party
General Election Manifesto

A general election has been forced upon the country by the action of the
House of Lords rejecting the Budget. The great question you are to decide is
whether the Peers or the people are to rule this country.

Each Session since the last general election important Bills, upon which the
House of Commons had spent much time, have been mutiliated or destroyed
by the House of Lords, an irresponsible body which represents nothing but
its own class interests. Not content with this, they now claim the right to
decide what taxes shall be paid, upon whom they shall be levied, and for
what purpose they shall be spent. They also claim to dictate the date at
which Parliament shall be dissolved. The time has come to put an end to
their power to override the will of the Commons.

The country has allowed landowners to pocket millions of pounds every year
in the share of unearned increment, and yet they object to pay a small tax
upon what, in justice, should belong to the State. They wish at all costs to
preserve their power to plunder the people.

The Labour party welcomes this opportunity to prove that the feudal age is
past and that the people are no longer willing to live on the sufferance of the
Lords.

The issues you have to decide are simple. Our present system of land
ownership has devastated our countryside, has imposed heavy burdens upon
our industries, has cramped the development of our towns, and has crippled
capital and impoverished labour.

The Lords must go

At this crisis the Labour party mertis your support. It comes with great
achievements and with a determination to do much more.

In 1906 it pledged itself to restore to trade unions the same liberty as capital

enjoyed during trade disputes.
THAT PLEDGE HAS BEEN FULFILLED

January 1910 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:04

It pledged itself to insist upon old-age pension.
THAT PLEDGE HAS BEEN FULFILLED

It pledged itself to help drastic housing reform.
THAT PLEDGE HAS BEEN FULFILLED

It pledged itself to work for the relief of the burdens on persons of small or
moderate means by the taxation of unearned incomes and land values.
THAT PLEDGE HAS BEEN FULFILLED

It pledged itself to pay special attention to the unemployed, and to compel
any and every Government to contribute to the solution of this problem.
THAT PLEDGE HAS BEEN FULFILLED

The experience of the last four years has demonstrated the value of the
Labour Party acting on independent lines. There still remain many problems
to be solved.

¢ The right to work has still to be won, but is now well within the range
of practical politics.

e The Poor Law must be broken up and pauperism abolished.

¢ Old-age pensions must be extended and increased on their present
non-contributory basis.

¢ Restrictions upon the franchise, including the sex bar, must be swept
away.

The working and middle classes are still overburdened with rates and taxes.
All these problems will demand the attention of an active, determined, and
independent party, drawn from the people and in touch with the people. The
Labour Party, therefore, appeals to you to renew your confidence in it, to add
to its ranks, and increase its power. Vote for the Labour candidates. The land
for the people. The wealth for the wealth producers. Down with privilege.
Up with the people.

December 1910 Labour Party
General Election Manifesto

 

You are again being asked to return a majority pledged to remove the House
of Lords as a block in the working of our Constitution. Do it, and do it
emphatically.

The Lords must go

But you ought not to allow this to cover up the questions in which you are
specially interested.

The iniquitous Osborne Judgement

The iniquitous Osborne Judgement, which deprives organised Labour of the
power to protect itself by political action, either locally or nationally, must
be reversed.

Do you think that you protect yourselves if the doors of the House of
Commons are closed to You?

The Osbourne Judgement is only the latest example of Judge-made Law,
from which you have already suffered so much.

Payments to members

You should also support payment of Members which, with the reversal of the
Osborne Judgement, is now the Charter of the Trade Unionist.

The New Parliament, will be called upon to deal with the right to work;
sickness insurance, land reform; adult suffrage; Poor Law reform; factory

inspection; medical treatment for school children.

None of these subjects can be properly considered unless there is a strong
and independent Party of Labour sitting in the House of Lords.

Let all petty differences go to the four winds. Now is the time to unite. The

poverty of one is the poverty of all. Let those who suffer join to remove their
suffering. It can be removed in no other way.

The Labour Party appeals to you to stand by yourselves and vote for the
Labour candidates.

1918 Labour Party General
Election Manifesto

 

Labour's call to the people

The Labour Party has left the Coalition, and is appealing to the men and
women of the country with a programme that is a challenge to reaction.

A peace of reconciliation

Victory has been achieved, and Labour claims no mean share in its
achievement. Not only have the workers supplied the vast majority of our
soldiers and sailors, and sustained the burden of war at home; the democratic
diplomacy which found expression in the War Aims of Labour has been one
of the most powerful factors in winning the war, and must be the most
powerful factor in the rebuilding of the world. The Peace which Labour
demands is a Peace of International Co-operation. It declares absolutely
against secret diplomacy and any form of economic war, and demands, as an
essential part of the Peace Treaty, an International Labour Charter
incorporated in the very structure of the League of Free Peoples.

Hands off democracy!

Labour welcomes the extension of liberty and democracy in Europe. It has
warned the Coalition that opposition towards the young democracies of the
Continent, and especially that intervention on the side of European reaction,
will be disastrous. Labour demands the immediate withdrawal of the Allied
forces from Russia. In the interest of world-democracy it stands for the
immediate restoration of the Workers International.

Freedom for Ireland

The principles which Labour acclaims as Allied war aims it will apply to our
own subject peoples. Freedom for Ireland and India it claims as democratic
rights, and it will extend to all subject peoples the right of self-determination

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1918/1918-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 4

1918 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:05

within the British Commonwealth of Free Nations. Labour's appeal to the
people is not a sectional appeal, unless an appeal which excludes only
militarists, profiteers, and place-hunters be regarded as sectional. It includes
all who are determined that the fruits of victory shall not be wasted in the
interests of riches or reaction. Especially does Labour appeal to two sections
of the community - to the soldiers and sailors who have fought the nation's
battles abroad, and to the men and women workers at home.

No conscription

The returning soldier or sailor will find himself once more a worker. His
cause is one with that of the workers at home. Civil and industrial liberties
have been largely suspended during the war; and soldier and worker want
their liberties back now. The Labour Party stands for the destruction of all
war-time measures in restraint of civil or industrial liberty, the repeal of the
Defence of the Realm Act, the complete abolition of Conscription, and the
release of all political prisoners. It stands for free citizenship, a Free
Parliament, for Free Speech, and against the domination of the Press by
sinister political influences.

The land for the workers

The Labour Party means to introduce large schemes of land reorganisation,
and it is fully aware that this can only be done in the teeth of the most
powerful vested interests. land nationalisation is a vital necessity; the land is
the people's and must be developed so as to afford a high standard of life to a
growing rural population not be subsidies or tariffs, but by scientific
methods, and the freeing of the soil from landlordism and reaction.

A million good houses

Labour demands a substantial and permanent improvement in the housing of
the whole people. At least a million new houses must be built at once at the
State's expense, and let at fair rents, and these houses must be fit for men and
women to live in. Labour will press for a really comprehensive Public
Health Act co-ordinating all health authorities, based on prevention rather
than cure, and free from servile or inquisitorial features. It will also press for
real public education, free and open to all, with maintenance scholarships
without distinction of class, and for justice to the teachers, upon whom
education finally depends.

A levy on capital

Labour will resist every attempt to place burdens upon the porr by indirect
taxation. Labour is firm against tariffs and for Free Trade. The way to deal
with unfair competition of imports made under sweated conditions is not by
tariffs, but by international labour legislation, which will make sweating

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1918/1918-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 4

1918 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:05

impossible. In paying the War Debt, Labour will place the burden on the
broadest backs by a special tax capital. Those who have made fortunes out
of the war must pay for the war; and Labour will insist upon heavily
graduated direct taxation with a raising of the exemption limit. That is what
Labour means by the Conscription of Wealth.

Industrial democracy

In industry, Labour demands the immediate nationalisation and democratic
control of vital public services, such as mines, railways, shipping,
armaments, and electric power; the fullest recognition and utmost extension
of trade unionism, both in private employment and in the public services. It
works for an altogether higher status for labour, which will mean also better
pay and conditions. The national minimum is a first step, and with this must
go the abolition of the menace of unemployment, the recognition of the
universal right to work or maintenance, the legal limitation of hours of
labour, and the drastic amendment of the Acts dealing with factory
conditions, safety, and workmen's compensation.

The real Women's Party

Labour has always stood for equal rights for both sexes, when other parties
were ignoring or persecuting women. In politics, the Labour Party stands for
complete adult suffrage, in industry for equal pay and the organisation of
men and women workers in one trade union movement. To the woman
worker and to the wife of the working man or the soldier, Labour can make a
confident appeal. Better pay and pensions for the workman or soldier mean
better conditions for his wife and family. There must be no sex party: the
Labour Party is the Women's Party. Woman is the Chancellor of the
Exchequer of the home. Labour stands with the Co-operative Movement in
its insistence on reasonable food prices and fair distribution, and in its
resistance to unfair taxation. The Labour Party will do all it can to aid co-
operators in their struggle for a democratic food organisation and against
unfair discrimination. Labour and Co-operation are a single movement, and
in the coming battle with reaction they must fight side by side.

Labour's programme is comprehensive and constructive. It is designed to
build a new world, and to build it by constitutional means. It is a programme
of national and international justice, founded on permanent democratic
principles. Even in an election as sinister as this, in which a large part of the
nation's youth is arbitrarily disfranchised by the Government, Labour
confidently appeals to the country to support its programme of social justice
and economic freedom.

1923 Labour Party General
Election Manifesto

 

Labour's appeal to the nation

After a year of barren effort, the Conservative Government has admitted its
inability to cope with the problem of Unemployment, and is seeking to cover
up its failure by putting the nation to the trouble and expense of an election
on the Tariff issue.

Tariffs no remedy

The Labour Party challenges the Tariff policy and the whole conception of
economic relations underlying it. Tariffs are not a remedy for
Unemployment. They are an impediment to the free interchange of goods
and services upon which civilised society rests. They foster a spirit of
profiteering, materialism and selfishness, poison the life of nations, lead to
corruption in politics, promote trusts and monopolies, and impoverish the
people. They perpetuate inequalities in the distrubution of the world's wealth
won by the labour of hands and brain. These inequalities the Labour Party
means to remove.

""Work or maintenance'

Unemployment is a recurrent feature of the existing economic system,
common to every industrialised country, irrespective of whether it has
Protection or Free Trade. The Labour Party alone has a positive remedy for
it. We denounce as wholly inadequate and belated the programme of winter
work produced by the Government, which offers the prospect of
employment for only a fraction of the unemployed in a few industries; and in
particular provides no relief for women and young persons.

Labour's unemployment programme

The Labour Party has urged the immediate adoption of national schemes of

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1923/1923-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 4

1923 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:05

productive work, with adequate maintenance for those who cannot obtain
employment to earn a livelihood for themselves and their families. The flow
of young workers from the schools must be regulated to relieve the pressure
on the labour market, and full educational training, with maintenance, must
be provided for the young people who are now exposed to the perils and
temptations of the streets.

The Labour Programme of National Work includes the establishment of a
National System of Electrical Power Supply, the development of Transport
by road, rail and canal, and the improvement of national resources by Land
Drainage, Reclamation, Afforestation, Town Planning and Housing
Schemes. These not only provide a remedy for the present distress, but are
also investments for the future.

Help for agriculture

Agriculture, as the largest and most essential of the nation's industries, calls
for special measures to restore its prosperity and to give the land workers a
living wage. The Labour Policy is one that will develop Agriculture and
raise the standard of rural life by establishing machinery for regulating
wages with an assured minimum, providing Credit and State Insurance
facilities for Farmers and Small-holders, promoting and assisting Co-
operative Methods in Production and Distribution, so as to help stabilise
prices, and make the fullest use of the results of research.

The Land

The Labour Party proposes to restore to the people their lost rights in the
Land, including Minerals, and to that end will work for re-equipping the
Land Valuation Department, securing to the community the economic rent of
land, and facilitating the acquisition of land for public use.

Peace among the nations

Labour's vision of an ordered world embraces the nations now torn with
enmity and strife. It stands, therefore, for a policy of International Co-
operation through a strengthened and enlarged League of Nations; the
settlement of disputes by conciliation and judicial arbitration; the immediate
calling by the British Government of an International Conference (including
Germany on terms of equality) to deal with the Revision of the Versailles
Treaty, especially Reparations and Debts; and the resumption of free
economic and diplomatic relations with Russia. This will pave the way for
Disarmament, the only security for the nations.

Relief for the taxpayer

Labour condemsn the failure of the Government to take steps to reduce the

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1923/1923-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 4

1923 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:05

dead-weight War Debt. No effective reform of the National Finances can be
attempted until the steady drain of a million pounds a day in interest is
stopped. Treasury experts, in evidence before a Select Committee of the
House of Commons, expressed their view that a Tax on War Fortunes could
be levied, and have therefore admitted both the principle and its
practicability. A labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with
Treasury experts, would at once work out a scheme to impose a non-
recurring, graduated War Debt Redemption levy on all individual fortunes in
excess of £5,000, to be devoted solely to the reduction of the Debt.

The saving thus effected, with reduction of expenditure on armaments, other
sane economies, and the increased revenue derived from Taxation of Land
Values, would make it possible to reduce the burden of Income Tax, abolish
not only the Food Duties, but also the Entertainments Tax and the
Corporation Profits Tax, as well as provide money for necessary Social
Services.

The Commonwealth of Co-operative Service

The Labour Party is working for the creation of a Commonwealth Co-
operative Service. It believes that so far only a beginning has been made in
the scientific organisation of industry. It will apply in a practical spirit the
principle of Public Ownership and Control to the Mines, the Railway
Service and the Electrical Power Stations, and the development of Municipal
Services. It will make work safe for the worker by stricter Inspection of
Workplaces, and more effective measures against Accidents and Industrial
Diseases. It will provide fuller Compensation for the Workers and improve
the Standard of Hours.

The aged, the widows, the children

Labour Policy is directed to the creation of a humane and civilised society.
When Labour rules it will take care that little children shall not needlessly
die; it will give to every child equality of opportunity in Education; it will
make generous provision for the aged people, the widowed mothers, the sick
and disabled citizens.

It will abolish the slums, promptly build an adequate suppy of decent homes

and resist decontrol till the shortage is satisfied. It will place the Drink
Traffic under popular control.

Ex-service men's pensions

In accordance with its past actions inside and outside Parliament, the Labour
Party will do its utmost to see that the Ex-Service men and their dependants
have fair play.

Equal rights

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1923/1923-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 4

1923 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:05

Labour stands for equality between men and women: equal political and
legal rights, equal rights and privileges in parenthood, equal pay for equal
work.

Labour's practical idealism

The Labour Party submits to the men and women of the country its full
programme. It urges them to refuse to make this General Election a wretched
partisan squablle about mean and huckstering policies. It appeals to all
citizens to take a generous and courageous stand for right and justice, to
believe in the possibility of building up a sane and ordered society, to oppose
the squalid materialism that dominates the world today, and to hold out their
hands in friendship and good-will to the struggling people everywhere who
want only freedom, security and a happier life.

1924 Labour Party General
Election Manifesto

 

Labour's appeal to the people

The Labour Government, defeated in the House of Commons by a partisan
combination of Liberals and Tories, appeals to the People.

Its work for peace

The supreme need of this country, as of the whole world, is peace among the
nations, and the restoration of industry and commerce. For this the Labour
Government has continuously worked; and it has already achieved much. It
has insisted on maintaining, in the spirit as in the letter, the honourable
binding Treaty with the Irish Free State, no less than the agreement with the
Northern Province. It has maintained, and even strengthened the ties of
sentiment with the Dominions upon which, rather than upon either force or
any Imperialism, the very existence of the British Commonwealth of Nations
depends. The embittered relations between France and Germany left by the
disastrous tangles of preceding Governments have been improved, and
cordial relations established between this country and France. Important
steps have been taken at Geneva towards arbitration, security and general
disarmament.

The Labour Government has refused to exclude from this general
pacification the Russian people, with whom it is essential to resume our
trade in the interests of our unemployed and the country as a whole.

The Treaties with Russia, now awaiting ratification, open up for our fishing
industry thousands of square miles of additional fishing ground, and provide
for new outlets for our manufactures and our coal. When compensation has
been secured to British subjects for their losses in Russia, a third Treaty will
be negotiated providing for the raising (from private financiers) by Russia of
a loan the interest and sinking fund charges on which shall be guaranteed by
Great Britain. It is laid down in Article 12 of the General Treaty that 'the
amount, terms and conditions of the said loan and the purposes to which it
shall be applied,' shall be defined in the future Treaty referred to; and this

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1924/1924-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 6

1924 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:06

Treaty ‘will not come into force until the necessary Parliamentary authority
for the guarantee of the said loan has been given.' Will you allow this work
for peace and prosperity to be stopped?

Its work for housing

In the face of much opposition, the Labour Government has passed into law
the Great Housing Charter, the statute that enabled the Local Authorities and
the Building Industry to engage in a fifteen years' uninterrupted building
programme, with such generous financial assistance as will provide:

1. Houses to let at low rents;
2. A separated dwelling for every family in the land;
3. Acontinuous policy of slum clearance and an ending of overcrowding.

Meanwhile, the Rent Restriction Acts (which practically expire next year)
have to be continued and amended; and the Bill to prevent profiteering in
building materials has still to be passed. It depends on the result of the
Election whether this great Housing Policy will be carried out.

The first Labour budget

In Finance, the Labour Government has achieved a marked success. Whilst
subjecting to the most competent examination its own and all other schemes
for dealing with the War Debt, and the terrible burden upon industry of a
tribute of £1,000,000 per day, the Labour Government has swept away no
less than £30,000 ,000 a year of taxes on the people's food (just six times as
much in eight months as the Liberal Government did in eight years). The
Labour Government has abolished the irritating Inhabited House Duty,
which no other Government had dared to do, and has taken the first step
towards the Abolition of the Entertainment Tax. It has found means to
change the whole spirit of the administration of the War Pensions Ministry,
to increase in many thousands of cases the pittance that the preceding
Governments had allotted to those Ex-Service Men who had suffered in the
War, and to the parents and dependants of those who have fallen. Above all,
the Labour Government has found means to stop the contemptible deduction
from the weekly ten shillings of many thousands of Old-Age Pensioners,
which the Liberal Government instituted, and the Unionist Government
persisted in maintaining; whilst nearly 200,000 more old people, to whom
the pension has been hitherto denied, have been admitted to the pension fold.
Is it not because the Liberals and Unionists fear the Second Labour Budget
that an excuse has been found for giving the Labour Government no further
chance?

What it has donw for education

Labour's intention to 'give every child equality of opportunity in education'
has begun to be fulfilled in the drastic change of the policy of the preceding

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1924/1924-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 6

1924 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:06

Government. The Labour Government has been insisting on smaller classes,
an increase in the number of full-qualified teachers, new schools,
maintenance for the poorer children, more free places in Secondary Schools
and Scholarships to the University: all practical steps towards the ideal of
securing to all children the same chance of advanced education as the
children of the rich. The Labour Government has been steadily working
towards progressively higher qualifications for teachers; and, consequently,
of no niggardly treatment of teachers' salaries. Shall this policy now be
reversed?

Labour and the countryside

The Labour Government has consistently acted on the conviction that
Agricultural Prosperity is vital to the nation. It has helped the farmers by
laons to their Co-operative enterprises, by assistance to their Credit
Societies, by increasing grants for the development of the Sugar Beet
Industry in this country. It has included exceptional provision, on a generous
scale, for a vast increase of cottages in the rural areas at low rents, which
will lessen the evil of the tied-cottage system. It has, after great difficulty
and opposition from both the other Parties, got District Wages Committees
and an Agricultural Wages Board once more set up by law, in the hope of
obtaining and maintaining a decent Standard of Life for the labourers.

Unemployment

Apart from the necessary transformation of the whole industrial system, the
only practicable way of dealing satisfactorily with Unemployment is the
working out of a constructive policy of National Development, along with
the restoration, through pacification, of the production and trade of other
nations. It is along these lines that the Labour Government has made
progress. Meanwhile the Government has stimulated useful enterprises and
helped works of further relief in all directions. During the building and other
industries, the number of unemployed has been reduced by considerably
over 100,000, and, indeed, by many more when allowance is made for the
increased number of workers brought on to the live register as a result of the
extension of the Insurance Act, and who had not previously been recorded as
unemployed. The great works, notably in the way of building, involving
furnishing, etc., and in the way of iron and steel and engineering for the
electrical and mining developments, should provide work for a much larger
proportion of the unemployed. For the others, Labour's slogan still remains
""Work or Maintenance’. By the drastic revision of the Unemployment
Insurance Acts last Auguest, (1) the 'gap' has been abolished and the
Benefits made continuous: (2) the arbitrary refusals of Benefit by the
preceding Governments to something like one-fifth of the claimants have
been stopped; (3) the weekly amount has been increased by about 25 per
cent.

1924 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:06

The increased financial assistance provided by the Labour Government in
aid of approved schemes of work and the improvements in the
Unemployment Insurance Acts have together substantially relieved the
heavy burdens previously borne by Local Authorities.

What the Liberals and Tories have combined to
stop

All the Labour Government's other Bills before Parliament, great or small,
are now summarily brought to an end. The great Factory Acts Amendment
Bill, the Bill to prevent Profiteering in Building Materials, the Forty-Eight
Hours (Washington Convention) Bill, the Bill to secure Wages for
Shipwrecked Seamen, the Bill to prevent Frauds in the Sale of Bread, and
various others, are stopped. But besides these Bills actually introduced, the
work for the next Session has been going on steadily. The measures still in
one or other stage of preparation for the next twelve months include
proposals for:

e The reorganisation of the whole Mining Industry (in conjunction with
By-Products and Power Stations), on the lines of National Ownership,
equitable treatment for all interests concerned, security both for the
taxpayer and the consumer, wages under properly-arrived at National
Agreements, and participation in administration, both national and
local, by the various grades and sections of those engaged in the
industry.

e The continuance and amendment of the Rent Restriction Acts with a
view to providing adequate protection for tenants.

e Adrastic dealing with the whole Poor Law System, so as to secure the
economy and efficiency of unified administration in each locality, and
complete and honourable provision for the sick and infirm, the aged,
the children and the able-bodied unemployed apart from the
workhouse and pauperism.

e The Taxation of Land Values and such a dealing with Agricultural
Land as will secure its maximum productivity, and with urban land
and building sites as would protect the occupying tenants and secure
its best use.

¢ The development of the present chaotic Electrical Generating Stations
on the lines of a National System, uniformly standardised with
transmission lines linking up town and country, with the primary
object of providing cheap power for industry - instead of profit for
shareholders - and cheap and convenient light for house-holders
everywhere.

e With regard to the measures to be taken in the national interest against
the evils and burdens connected with the administration of the
Licensing Laws, the first step, it is clear, in the present state of the
controversy, is a full and impartial inquiry by a Royal Commission.
This is the Labour Government had arranged to begin next Spring.

In addition to these measures the following proposals are being considered

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1924/1924-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 6

1924 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:06

and prepared for:

e Asystematic reorganisation, in the national interest and on terms fair
to all concerned, of the whole system of Transport, including the more
rapid development of an entirely Unified Railway and Canal System
in National Ownership and under exclusively Public Control, with
fuller use of electric power and in more intimate connection not only
with the ports, but also with the increasing road motor service.
Without greater and cheaper transport facilities, the British producers
of every kind will find it ever harder to compete with their rivals.

¢ The Prevention of Profiteering and Exploitation by Rings, Trusts and
Monopolies, not merely in building materials, but also in foodstuffs
and household necessities, in conjunction with concerted
arrangements with the Dominions and other Governments for bulk
importing and systematically organised distribution from port to
consumer, as a means towards establishing reasonable and stable
prices.

¢ A substantial improvement of the Workmen's Compensation Acts,
which the Tory Government denied to injured workers.

e The Prevention of Excessive Hours of Labour in the distributive trade,
in the mercantile marine, and in other occupations (including those of
women) omitted from the Washington Forty-Eight-Hours Convention:
together with proposals for such a further development of the system
of Trade Boards as will prevent the still existing evils of Sweating.

e Whether any of these projects can be proceeded with, and which of
them, and to what extent, depends on the electors' response to the
present appeal.

A word to the women

Is it nothing to you that the Labour Government's successful work for Peace,
its great programme of Housebuilding, its sweeping reduction in the Food
Taxes, its forward policy for the Children's Chooling, should be interrupted,
and that the Bill giving Votes for Women at 21 on the same terms as men
should be killed? But there is more to be said. During the past few months
the detailed working out of the Labour Government's measure giving
Pensions for Widowed Mothers with Children has reached an advanced
stage. In the very next Session it was to have been laid before Parliament.
This is what the Liberals and Tories have combined to stop. It depends on
this Election whether the Labour Government can secure this great reform.

The spirit that giveth life

It is along such lines as those marked out in this Appeal, and in the spirit of
public service herein indicated, that the Labour Party, in conformity with its
consistent public declarations, would work in Parliament towards the
transformation, gradual as it must be, of the existing economic and industrial
system into a genuine Commonwealth of Labour. We know the facts. We
realise the difficulties. The path to our goal is long and narrow and

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1924/1924-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 6

1924 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:06

sometimes so hard to travel that men and women faint by the way. But we
have faith in humanity. We refuse to believe that there is nothing to be done
but conserve the present order, which is disorder; or that the misery, the
demoralisation and the ruin that it causes to innocent men and women and
children can be remedied by the perpetual repetition of the abstract
principles of Individualism.

We appeal to the People to support us in our steadfast march - taking each
step only after careful examination, making sure of each advance as we go,
and using each success as the beginning of further achievements towards a
really Socialist Commonwealth, in which there shall at least be opportunity
for Good Will to conquer Hate and Strife, and for Brotherhood, if not to
supersede Greed, at least to set due bounds to that competition which leads
only to loss and death.

1929 Labour Party General
Election Manifesto

 

Labour's appeal to the nation

The long-awaited opportunity has now come for the Nation to give its
verdict on the present Government.

By its inaction during four critical years it has multiplied our difficulties and
increased our dangers. Unemployment is more acute than when Labour left
office. International relations are worse. Vast areas of the country are
derelict. The posters on our hoardings announcing the grim truth that 'a
million of our fellow countrymen are needing food and clothing' tell how the
Government has failed. In the face of such a state of things this Tory
Government has sat supinely with folded arms without a policy, without a
vision, waiting for Providence or charity to do its work. For nine months the
Government watched the paralysing struggle in the Coal Industry. It aided
and abetted the mine owners when they locked out the men, and provoked
the industrial unrest that led to the General Strike, for which the Government
was mainly responsible. The Government's further record is that it has
helped its friends by remissions of taxation, whilst it has robbed the funds of
the workers' National Health Insurance Societies, reduced Unemployment
Benefits, and thrown thousands of workless men and women on to the Poor
law.

Tories tax the poor

The Tory Government has added £38 000,000 to indirect taxation, which is
an increased burden on the wage-earners, shop-keepers and lower middle
classes. In its only Budget the Labour Government reduced the Food Taxes
by £25 000,000. Now that the Election is in sight the Tory Chancellor has
repealed what was left of the Tea Duty but has retained the duties on sugar,
coffee and cocoa and other foods. This remission only amounts to one-sixth
of the additional indirect taxation he has added in the last four years.

Whilst every economic influence has been tending to reduce the cost of
living the Government's policy has been to put obstacles in the way. It means

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1929/1929-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 7

1929 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:06

to continue this policy. The Tory plan for solving Unemployment and
improving trade - called 'Safeguarding' was denounced by the Prime
Minister in 1923 as 'pottering along'. He was right, as experience shows.
'Safeguarded' countries have unemployment, low wages and sweating,
poverty, generally corrupt politics, and high costs of living.

The old bogey

In order to hide their record of incompetence and reaction, Tory leaders are
trying to frighten the electors with horrifying pictures of the disasters which
would come upon the country if a Labour Government were returned. It was
such scaremongering tactics as this which gave the Tories a majority at the
last Election. We do not believe that the voters will be misled a second time
by such discreditable deception.

We warn the electors against the misrepresentations of Socialism and the
aims and Policy of the Labour Party, which are already pouring from our
opponents.

The Labour Party is neither Bolshevik nor Communist. It is opposed to
force, revolution and confiscation as means of establishing the New Social
Order. It believes in ordered progress and in democratic methods.

Unemployment

The Labour Party gives an unqualified pledge to deal immediately and
practically with this question. Its record on Unemployment is a guarantee
that this pledge will be kept. Only by the unceasing advocacy of Labour
have the claims of the Unemployed been forced to the forefront of political
issues in the teeth of the opposition and neglect of the Liberal and Tory
Parties.

When the Labour Government was in office it announced to Parliament
schemes of a comprehensive and far-reaching character which it had already

begun to put into effect. Immediately afterwards both Parties united and
defeated the Government! They could not tolerate its continued success.

Labour's plans

Our schemes for dealing with Unemployment have been before the country
for years before the Liberal Party - in the hope of reviving its declining
fortunes - appropriated some of them and proclaimed them as original.

They are three-fold in character.
1. National Development and Trade Prosperity

Labour will undertake:

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1929/1929-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 7

1929 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:06

Housing and Slum Clearance;

Land Drainage and Reclamation;

Electrification;

The Reorganisation of Railways and Transport;

New Roads and Road and Bridge Improvements;

Afforestation associated with Small Holdings;

Training and assistance by agreements with the Dominions for those
who wish to try their fortunes in new lands.

The most important attack upon Unemployment is to restore prosperity to
the depressed industries, and develop our country. This programme will not
only provide employment for large numbers of those who are now out of
work, but its reaction of other industries will be immediate and beneficial.

There is a great market at home which can be developed by increasing the
purchasing power of the working classes. There is a greater market overseas,
especially in India and the Crown Colonies, where there are enormous
populations with a very low standing of living and vast undeveloped
resources.

A Labour Government will set to work at once by using Export Credits and
Trade Facilities Guarantees, to stimulate the depressed export trades of Iron
and Steel, Engineering, and Textile Manufactures. Shipbuilding and
Shipping will immediately be benefited by an increase of foreign trade, and
the improved employment in these industries will be a great addition to the
purchasing power in the home market.

2. Maintenance

The Labour Party's plan for dealing with Unemployment is to provide work;
but pending the absorption of the unemployment in regular occupations it
will take steps to relieve the present distress. It will also amend the
Unemployment Insurance Act so as to afford more generous maintenance for
the unemployed, and will remove those qualifications which deprive them of
payments to which they are entitled.

3. The Young and the Old

A Labour Government would also relieve the congestion in the labour
market. Every year about 400,000 young persons, inadequately educated and
inadequately trained, are brought into the labour market; while at the other
end there are thousands of aged persons now compelled by poverty to
struggle for employment who would be willing to retire if proper provision
were made for them.

The Party would extend the school age of fifteen with the necessary
Maintenance Grants and provide Adequate Pensions for Aged Workers.

The Coal Industry

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1929/1929-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 7

1929 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:06

The state of the Coal Mining Industry is so tragic that measures would be
immediately undertaken to alleviate the distress in the coal fields, organise
the industry from top to bottom both on its productive and marketing sides,
and shorten the hours of labour. A Labour majority would Nationalise the
Mines and Minerals as the only condition for satisfactory working. It would
develop the scientific utilisation of coal and its valuable by-products, now
largely wasted.

Housing

The Labour Party is the Party of the Workers' Home. In 1924, it revived the
policy of building Houses to be let and not sold. It will return to that policy
until there are enough Houses let at Working-class Rents. It will deal
drastically with the Slum disgrace and will provide the necessary money
grants for both purposes. In the meantime it will protect tenants by
continuing the Rent Restriction Acts.

International Peace

Peace is one of the greatest issues of the Election. The Labour Government
found Europe distracted by hostility and left it in a peaceful frame of mind.
The Party's record when in office entitles it to the confidence of all lovers of
peace. It desires to resume its work and to regain for this country the proud
position it held in 1924.

The Tory Government has hampered Disarmament, and systematically
obstructed the work of the League of Nations and of the International
Labour Office. Labour's policy is precisely the opposite. It will establish the
largest possible measure of political and economic co-operation amongst the
nations, and give the fullest and most cordial support to the League and the
International Labour Office.

Labour stands for Arbitration and Disarmament. It will accept the general
Act of Arbitration, Conciliation and Judicial Settlement approved by the
League. A drastic reduction of armaments is long overdue. Labour welcomes
the initiative of the United States. It will press for the speedy completion of
the Disarmament Treaty and the convocation of a General Disarmament
Conference.

Labour will re-establish diplomatic and commercial relations with Russia.

Labour and agriculture

Labour is deeply concerned about Agriclture which, having been a plaything
of both the older Parties, is now facing very critical times both for farmers
and workers. An Agricltural Policy must be co-ordinated with a Town
Policy. Farming must be made to pay.

Landlordism has ceased to be able to perform its function and it cannot be

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1929/1929-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 7

1929 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:06

allowed to go on starving the Land of capital and the countryside of
cultivation and people, and generally obstructing national need and
development. The Land must therefore pass under Public Control.
Meanwhile, Farmers should have Security of Enure; Fair Rents; Capital and
Credit Assistance; A system of Organised Marketing; and Stability in the
Prices of main crops and products. Workers should have a Minimum Wage;
Unemployment Insurance; Easier Access to Holdings; and Better and Untied
Cottages. A Labour Government would work with representatives of all the
interests concerned to gain these objects.

Education

The Labour Party has always been committed to securing Equal Educational
Opportunities for eveyr child. It will raise the school-leaving age to fifteen
with the requisite Maintenance Grants and at once develop facilities for Free
Secondary Education. Labour will open the road, to whoever is able to take
it, from the Nursery School to the University.

Labour's taxation policy

The Party stands for a system of Taxation which will distribute the burden
fairly according to ‘ability to pay’. It will abolish Taxes on Food and other
necessaries, and provide what revenue is needed by Death Duties on large
estates and by graduating the Income Tax and Sur-Tax with a view to
relieving the smaller, while increasing the contribution from the larger,
incomes. The Labour Party will carry still further the differentiation between
‘earned' and 'unearned' incomes.

Taxation of land values

The Party will deal drastically with the scandal of the appropriation of Land
Values by private landowners. It will take steps to secure for the community
the increased value of land which is created by industry and the expenditure
of public money.

Extension and improvement of pensions

The grave injustices of the existing Widows', Orphans' and Old Age
Pensioners Acts would be immediately remedied, and as soon as the urgent
legislation to deal with Unemployment had been carried through, a
comprehensive co-ordination and extension of all the Pensions Schemes
would be undertaken so as to give the opportunity to many classes of
persons now excluded to come in.

The limit of seven years which has meant so much injustice to ex-Service
Men will be removed, so that cases may still be considered.

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1929/1929-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 7

1929 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:06

Industrial and domestic

Among the other measures which a Labour Government would enact are the
Factories Bill, the Ratification of the Washington Eight Hours' Convention,
and the amendment of the Workmen's Compensation Acts and the Trade
Union Law. It will also, as promised, appoint Committees of Inquiry into the
causes of depression in the Cotton and Iron and Steel Industries with a view
to their reorganisation.

It would take steps to prevent the Profiteering in Food, and in Building
Materials, and would watch the operations of Trusts and Combines, so that
combinations, which enhance prices unreasonably or refuse to supply or to
sell to persons who will not deal exclusively with them, may be made
subject to law.

It would support the creation of separate legislative assemblies in Scotland,
Wales and England, with autonomous powers in matters of local concern.

In order to prepare the way for the Reform of the licensing Laws, the first
necessary step is a full and impartial inquiry, which a Labour Government
would institute at once by Royal Commission.

An appeal to the women

The Labour Party makes its appeal to the Women Voters with the fullest
confidence. It was advocating the cause of Equal Citizenship when the Tory
and Liberal Parties were either utterly hostile or hopelessly divided on the
question. Although Equal Franchise has been secured after a protracted
struggle, the fight for women's emancipation is not yet finished. There are
other anomalies and injustices - lega, social and economic - especially
affecting women and children which must be dealth with.

The Labour Party recognises that the burden of social injustice and
economic exploitation fails with special severity on women, and that women
are very seriously affected by Unemployment, Low Wages, Bad Housing,
and by any restriction of the necessary public expenditure on Education and
on the Health and Welfare of Mothers and Children. The prevention of
Maternal Mortality will be an immediate concern of a Labour Government.

The Labour Party in its legislative and administrative policy would seek to
pursue and apply the principle of equal tratment for men and women.

Moreover, there is the important question of universal peace, vital to all,
which requires to be organised on a permanent basis so as to terminate for

every the futility of a civilised country squandering human life and wasting
its national resources in war.

No pleges we cannot fulfil

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1929/1929-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 7

1929 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:06

We shall not deceive the people by saying that the task of National and
Social Reconstruction is easy, or that it can be accomplished in a day or a
year. But the Labour Party does pledge itself to undertake this great work
with energy and enthusiam, and it confidently believes that, if it has a
majority, in the full lifetime of a Parliament great advance in industrial
prosperity, in social wellbeing, and in a more just distribution of the fruits of
labour, can be made.

The choice of the electors

At this Election, voters have to choose not only the representatives of
constituencies, but a Government. A Labour Government is the only
alternative to the present Tory Government. The Liberal Party, as its leaders
admit, can be no more than a small minority in the new Parliament. The
electors who desire to save the country from the disaster of continued Tory
rule must therefore vote for Labour Candidates.

Wanted! A majority!

Along this path Labour will advance.

The Labour Programme of peaceful but determined National Development
and Reconstruction leading towards the Socialist and Co-operative
Commonwealth is the only alternative to Reaction and Revolution. On this
Programme Labour asks for the support of men and women of good will of
all classes. Labour wants to make its contribution to the removal of poverty
and the injustices which today are diseases in society. Both the other Parties
have been tried and have failed. The state of the country is the monument of
their failure.

We pledge ourselves to give unsparingly the best we can of our energy,

experience and knowledge, to the great of making Britain a happier and
more contented land, and establishing peace in the world.

1931 Labour Party General
Election Manifesto

 

Labour's call to action: the nation's opportunity

A decisive opportunity is given to the nation to reconstruct the foundations
of its life.

The Capitalist system has broken down even in those countries where its
authority was thought to be most secure.

Its fails to give employment to many millions of willing workers.
Its accumulates vast stocks of commodities which it is unable to distribute.

To re-establish its position, it now demands from the unemployed and the
wage-earner the surrender of their hard-won standard of life; and it seeks to
force the Government of this country to restrict or abandon those social
services which the Labour Party believes to be an essential condition of a
democratic society.

False front of 'unity'

The Labour Government was sacrificed to the clamour of Bankers and
Financiers. Because it placed the needs of the workers before the demands of
the rich, a so-called 'National' Government was installed in its place to wrest
from Parliament the authority to satisfy them. The policy of that
Government has proved a disastrous failure. Formed to maintain that gold
standard which it declared in panic-stricken accents to be the indispensable
condition of national safety, within less than three weeks it abandoned that
standard with the insolent explanation that industry would benefit by the
change.

Having failed completely in its original object, it now seeks from the
electorate a mandate for the impossible task of rebuilding Capitalism.
Composed of men who differ profoundly on all the main principles of public
policy, unable to agree upon any of the essential methods by which to restore
prosperity to the nation, this ill-assorted association of life-long antagonists

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1931/1931-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 7

1931 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:06

seeks a blank cheque from the people for purposes it is unable to define.
Acutely divided within itself; headed by men who are now acting in direct
contradiction to their own previous convictions, certain, in the nera future, to
split into fragments, it makes the shameless pretence of being the instrument
of national unity.

The Labour Party is confident that the country will not be deceived by
claims so arrogant and so dishonest.

We must plan or perish

The Labour Party seeks a majority from the electorate upon the basis of a
coherent and definite programme. It reaffirms its conviction that Socialism
provides the only solution for the evils resulting from unregulated
competition and the domination of vested interests. It presses for the
extension of public-owned industries and services operated solely in the
interests of the people. It works for the substitution of co-ordinated planning
for the anarchy of individualistic enterprise.

Labour insists that we must plan our civilisation or perish.

Labour government's record

The Labour Party reaffirms its faith in the considered principles of its
programme of 1929 laid down in Labour and the Nation.

Despite the unexampled difficulties confronted by the Party when, as a
Minority Government, and in the face of a world economic crisis, it took
office two years ago, it made a substantial beginning in translating that
programme into Acts of Parliament.

Its policy of national development resulted not only in economic public
works of unprecendented magnitude, but also in strenuous attempts, by
legislation and otherwise, to imrpove the efficiency of our agricultural,
transport, coal and other chief industries. The Labour Government made
important improvements in Unemployment Insurance and the consequent
transfer of heavy burdens from the Poor Law. There were wide extensions of
housing and pensions legislation, and the vigorous promotion of education
and the health services. In the international field Labour's record was pre-
eminent.

This record was achieved under the intolerable restrictions of its minority
position in the House of Commons. Frustrated by political intrigues and the
class-conscious hostility of the House of Lords and undermined by the
organised pressue of business interests, it now asks for power to press
forward rapidly to the fulfilment of its programme. In that endeavour it will
tolerate no opposition from the House of Lords to the considered mandate of
the People; and it will seek such emergency powers as are necessary to the
full attainment of its objectives.

1931 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:06

Socialist reconstruction imperative

The Labour Party recognises that the present situation calls for bold and
rapid actions. The decay of capitalist civilisation brooks no delay. Measures
of Socialist reconstruction must be vigorously pressed forward. That is the
task to which Labour will lay its hand.

The banking system

The Labour Party is convinced, in the light particularly of experience since
1925, that the banking and credit system of the country can no longer be left
in private hands. It must be brought directly under national ownership and
control.

The Labour Party further is convinced of the need to form a National
Investment Board with statutory powers for the control of dmoestic and
foreign investment. It would seek powers from the new Parliament to effect
this transformation.

Aiming at a monetary policy which will stabilise prices, the Labour Party
condemns either currency inflation or a new and disastrous attempt at
deflation to force sterling back to the old gold parity. It will take a vigorous
initiative in calling an International Conference to arrive at a concerted
monetary policy. It will seek thereby to make the resources of civilisation
available for peoples who today in the new world, as in the old, are starving
in the midst of plenty.

The Labour Party has never failed to insist upon the intimate relation
between war debts, reparations, and economic depression. It believes that the
general acceptance of President Hoover's Moratorium on War Debts permits
a reconsideration of the whole question.

It seeks an immediate reopening of negotiations between the signatories of
the Young Plan and the United States with a view to attaining the conditions
in which Inter-Allied War Debts and Reparations may be cancelled.

Tariffs no cure

The Labour Party has no confidence in any attempt to bolster up a bankrupt
Capitalism by a system of tariffs. Tariffs would artifically increase the cost
of living. They would enrich private interests at the expense of the Nation.
They would prejudice the prospect of international co-operation. In the
circumstances produced by our departure from the gold standard, they have
no relevance to economic need. In the face of the millions unemployed in
high-tariff America and Germany, they are clearly no cure for
unemployment. They would permanently injure our shipping and export
trades and conceal our need for greater efficiency in industrial organisation.

The Labour Party urges a better way.

http://www. labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1931/1931-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 7

1931 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:06

It urges the definite planning of industry and trade so as to produce the
highest standard of life for the Nation.

As a first step, it proposes to reorganise the most important basic industries -
Power, Transport, Iron and Steel - as public services owned and controlled in
the national interest, with such a regulation of prices as will enable British
industry to compete effectively in the markets of the world. Wherever
necessary, Import Boards will be created for foodstuffs, raw material, and
manufactured goods with all adequate powers of regulation and purchase.
For the proper and organised conduct of export, machinery will be set up in
connection with the principal industries.

Efficiency in industry

The Labour Party demands efficiency. Any special assistance of industry
must be conditional upon the acceptance of the necessary measure of public
ownership or control. Labour will insist upon the adoption of efficient
methods of production so as to secure good conditions of employment for
the worker. The consumer must be protected by effective regulation of
prices.

Labour in power will remove the unjustified restrictions upon Trade Union
activity introduce by the Tory Government in 1927; and it will press forward
with legislation upon such matters as Workmen's Compensation, and the
Conditions of the Hours of Labour.

Because it appreciates the vital importantance of the Co-operative
Movement, the Labour Party will work in full alliance with co-operators,
utilising their long experience and specialised knowledge.

The tragic position of the Coal Industry reveals the complete inability of
private ownership to organise it as a national asset and Labour in power will
proceed at the first opportunity to the unification of the industry under public
ownership and control.

International disarmament

The Labour Party has always been in the van of the Movement for
International Peace; and it is universally recognised that its record, as a
Government, above all in solving disarmament by Arbitration, gave to Great
Britain the moral leadership of the World. Labour will seek to make that
record even more distinguished.

It will seek, at the Disarmament Conference next February, to put forward
proposals for drastic and far-reaching reductions by international agreement,
in the numbers and equipment of all armed forces, and in all expenditure
upon them. Labour insists that without this policy of disarmament there
cannot be either peace or security.

Labour will, as in the past, lend its full support to the use of the valuable

machinery of the League of Nations in every phase of international activity.

The countryside

The Labour Government has already made a real beginning towards the
scientific re-organisation of agriculture. The Labour Party will seek to press
forward that development. It holds that, for this purpose, the land must be
publicly ownered and controlled, and much more fully utilised for food
production and the provision of employment under good conditions.

To achieve this end, full use must be made of the Acts passed under its
auspices. The necessary machinery must be set up to make possible that
comprehensive plan of development under which alone agriculture can
become a prosperous industry.

The Labour Party emphasises its insistence that the condition of the farm-
worker must be improved, especially by provision for Unemployment
Insurance, a National Wages Board to control county wage machinery, and
the abolition of the tied cottage.

India

The Labour Party places on record its conviction that the summoning of the
Round Table Conference by the Labour Government in 1930 opened a new
epoch in the history of our relations with India. It is convinced that its
reassembly offers a unique opportunity to establish a new era of friendly
partnership between the two peoples. While recognising the difficulties to be
surmounted, the Labour Party will offer stern opposition to those who seek
to prevent the Conference from bearing its full result.

If returned to power, Labour will leave no stone unturned to bring the
Conference to a successful issue.

The Government's cuts

The Labour Ministers resigned because they refused to abandon Labour's
cardinal principle that proper provision for the unemployed is a social duty
and a national responsibility. Sound public policy demands the absorption of
the unemployed into normal work; while that is being effected, adequate
maintenance should be provided.

The Labour Party protests against the reduction in the rates of
unemployment benefit and the increase in contributions. It denounces the
introduction of Poor Law Tests and machinery into the administration of
Unemployment Insurance.

It pledges itself to reverse immediately the harsh policy of the present
Government.

1931 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:06

The social services

Labour accepts a balanced Budget as the first condition of sound national
finance, but it condemns the Economy Act as an unjustified means of
attaining this end.

It pledges itself to maintain and develop the social services and to deal with
the Rents Problem. It will restore, as rapidly as the claims of the unemployed
and other depressed sections of the community permit, the remuneration of
teachers and other public servants.

Labour asks for power

It is for these ends that the Labour Party asks for power at the forthcoming
Election.

It warns the Nation that the alternative is the continuance in office of a
Government harsh in purpose and incompetent in method, whose failure to
produce a constructive policy offers no prospect of hope. Dominated as that
Government is by the selfish interests of big business and finance, its return
would encourage ruinous attacks on wages. Its victory would perpetuate the
degradation and misery of unemployment. It would intensify nationalist
economic conflict, and imperil all progress towards international co-
operation and disarmament without which there can be no hope of peace or
prosperity.

The Labour Party offers to the people of this country planned reconstruction,
national and international, instead of the chaos and anarchy which are the
parents of disaster. It recognises the gravity of the issue; it is prepared to
meet it by bold and drastic remedies.

Given a majority, the Labour Party pledges itself to unsparing efforts to
remove the spectres of want and insecurity from the homes of the people,
that this and succeeding generations may be assured of a fuller and richer
life.

1922 Labour Party General
Election Manifesto

 

Labour's call to the people

The Coalition has been destroyed and a Conservative Government has been
formed to carry out a policy of naked reaction. Labour is appealing to the
men and women of the country on a policy of International Peace and
National Reconstruction.

Peace and the League of Nations

Revision of the Peace Treaties, which has caused greater international
wrongs than they removed, is the first step to Peace. German reparations
must be brought within Germany's capacity to pay. Turkey's relations with
Europe and the Freedom of the Straits can only be dealt with in an
International Conference attended by representatives of all countries
concerned.

Labour is working for an all-inclusive League of Nations with power to deal
with international disputes by methods of judicial arbitration and

conciliation. Through the League of Nations an agreement can be reached
for a limitation of armaments, with general disarmament as the goal.

Freedom in the Empire

Labour advocates the recognition of the real independence of Egypt and self-
government for India.

Labour demands the prompt and cordial acceptance of the new constitution

of the Irish Free State, and supports every effort to make Ireland united,
prosperous, and contented.

How to find the money

https://web.archive.org/web/20040212175705/http://labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1922/1922-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 5

1922 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:08

Labour recognises the urgent need of lifting from the trade and industry of
the country the deadweight burden of the National Debt. It therefore
proposes the creation of a War Debt Redemption Fund, by a special
graduated levy on fortunes exceeding £5,000. labour will not penalise thrift,
but will require some restitution from the profiteers out of the huge fortunes
made in the war.

To secure the necessary annual revenue, Labour advocates a system of
taxation which will distribute the burden fairly according to ‘ability to pay’.

It proposes an increase of the Death Duties on large estates and of the Super-
Tax on large incomes; incomes below £250 a year would be exempt from
taxation and there would be a reduction in the tax on all incomes under £500
a year, with a steeper graduation of the scale above that limit.

Taxation of Land Values will secure to the community socially-created
wealth now diverted to private hands.

Labour is in principle opposed to indirect taxation. It stands for an untaxed
breakfast table, and wishes to free trade and industry from all burdensome
imposts, whether customs, excise, or stamp duties.

No 'penny-wise' economy

Labour attaches the utmost importance to economy in the public
administration. But we do not believe in starving the public services, least of
all do we countenance the notion of economics at the expense of the poor for
the benefit of the rich.

Reduced expenditure on the children's education and health, the safety of the
workers, and the well-being of mothers and babies is the costliest kind of
waste.

By a revision of the National Grants in Aid to local Authorities, we believe

an equitable reduction of rates in all the severely pressed districts can be
secured.

Policy for unemployment

Unemployment and low wages, caused by the policy of the Liberal and
Unionist Government, have brought distress to the bulk of the working
people.

Labour's policy is to provide work, or maintenance, for the unemployed by
reopening trade with foreign countries, by the national organisation of
production, and by a large programme of necessary and useful public works.

Agriculture

https://web.archive.org/web/20040212175705/http://labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1922/1922-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 5

1922 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:08

The plight of Agriculture can only be dealt with by a bold policy of
reorganisation. Those who produce the nation's food must not go hungry.
Labour proposes to require the landlords to sacrifice rents rather than to ask
the farm-workers to accept starvation wages.

We advocate the restoration of the Agricultural Wages Board to enforce an
adequate national wage standard.

We propose also the establishment of representative Councils of Agriculture
to promote all-round improvements in the use of the land, the reduction of
transport charges, the development of co-operative methods, and the
fostering of rural industries.

Revision of the Game Laws, improved school facilities, more and better
cottages, increased hospital accommodation, and fuller opportunities of
recreation are included in Labour's rural policy.

Industrial reorganisation

Labour is resolved to change as speedily as possible by constructive
measures the social and economic system which confers unfair privileges on
the few, and undeserved hardship on the many. The working of this system
has brought unemployment and reduced wages to the workers, suffering and
starvation to their families, loss of opportunities for full mental and physical
development to their children, anxiety and worry to the salaried and
professional workers and small traders. Labour means to bring about a more
equitable distribution of the wealth produced by the common effort of the
workers by hand and brain.

Our industrial policy involves the prompt Nationalisation of Mines, as
recommended by the Sankey Commission, and the Nationalisation of
Railways, with an increased share of control for the workers, an improved
Workmen's Compensation Act, and other measures for the protection of the
workpeople.

We oppose all attempts to interfere with the Trade Boards.

Houses and health

Our social programme includes a national scheme of housing which will end
the scandal of a homeless population and replace the slums by decent homes.

More generous provision for the Old Age Pensioners has been one of
Labour's constant demands, and is one we shall continue to press. We shall
also urge the removal of the present unjust deductions from Old Age
Pensions where Friendly Society or Trade Union benefits or small savings
exist, whereby thrift is at present penalised. We stand for the complete
supersession of the Poor Law and the institution of a system of Pensions for
Widowed Mothers. Labour will strive to stop the continued attempts now
being made to cut off or cut down the ex-Service men's pensions; it demands

https://web.archive.org/web/20040212175705/http://labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1922/1922-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 5

1922 Labour Party Manifesto - 13/06/2024, 13:08

the conversion of conditional into permanent pensions, and it will resist all
attempts to tranfer the mentally or physically infirm to the Poor Law.

In our view, the rule to be applied by the Pensions Ministry throughout its
administration should be, 'Fit for service, fit for pension’.

More power to democracy

The Labour Party has always declared its opposition to measures which
increase the power of the wealthier classes to frustrate the people's will. The
Parliament Act must stand, and there must be no restoration of the Lords'
veto.

Our policy is to remove all existing disabilities affecting women as citizens,
voters, and workers. Adult suffrage, reform of Parliamentary procedure, and
control of Ministers by the House of Commons are included in our
programme to make the people's will effective by constitutional means. In
accordance with these democratic principles Labour must stand for the
control of the Liquor Traffic according to the people's will.

Higher standard of life

The task of government is to raise the standard of life and labour for those
whose work of hand and brain increases the nation's wealth.

Parliaments have in the past been too much concerned to protect the
privileges and extend the power of the rich. Labour wants to increase the
happiness and prosperity of the poor, by better housing, better schooling,
better living, better health, more leisure, more freedom, more opportunities
for enjoying the good things of life.

We shall defend the school as we defend the home, and we aim at providing
the rising generation with full protection from harmful and degrading moral
and social conditions.

Against revolution

Labour's programme is the best bulwark against violent upheaval and class
wars. Democratic government can be made effective in this country without
bloodshed or violence. Labour's policy is to bring about a more equitable
distribution of the nation's wealth by constitutional means. This is neither
Bolshevism nor Communism, but common sense and justice.

This is Labour's alternative to Reaction and Revolution.

1935 Labour Party General
Election Manifesto

The Labour Party's call to power

Four years have passed since the 'National' Government obtained a swollen
majority in the House of Commons on a campaign of fraud,
misrepresentation and panic. The Government has now decided to plunge
the nation into an electoral struggle in the midst of an international crisis.

The Labour Party deplores this attempt to exploit for partisan ends a
situation of grave international anxiety.

It accepts the challenge and enters the Election confident of victory.

Four barren years

At the end of four years the country faces the grim spectacle of two million
workless with an army of well over a million and a half people on the Poor
law, and with the deepening tragedy of the distressed areas. Whilst doles of
varying kinds have been dispensed on a lavish scale to industry after
industry, not a single constructive step has been taken to improve the lot of
the people.

¢ The Government has robbed the unemployed of benefit and subjected
them to a harsh and cruel household means test.

¢ It withdrew, under a storm of public indignation, its new
Unemployment Regulations, and after nine months of reconsideration
of this burning question it has ignominiously failed to produce any
policy for the proper care of the unemployed.

e It has retarded the building of houses to let, curtailed schemes on food
and other necessaries of life and by deliberately organising restriction
of supplies.

The international situation

The Government has a terrible responsibility for the present international
situation. It did nothing to check the aggression of Japan in the Far East, and
thus seriously discredited the League of Nations and undermined the
Collective Peace System.

It has wrecked the Disarmament Conference by resisting all the constructive

http://labourmanifesto.com/1935/1935-labour-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 13:10

Page 1 of 3

1935 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:10

proposals made by other States. As regards air armaments, in particular,
Lord Londondery has boasted that he succeeded, though with great
difficulty, in preventing an agreement for the complete abolition of all
national air forces.

The Government has helped to restart the arms race, and it failed to make
Signor Mussolini understand that, if he broke the peace in Africa, Britain
would join with other nations in upholding the authority of the League.

Too late to stop the war, the Government ranged itself at the eleventh hour
behind the Covenant at Geneva. Even so, its action has been slow and half-
hearted. Whilst paying lip-service to the League it is planning a vast and
expensive rearmament programme, which will only stimulate similar
programmes elsewhere. This Government is a danger to the peace of the
world and to the security of the country.

Labour's peace policy

The Labour Party calls for a reversal of this suicidal foreign policy. It seeks
wholehearted co-operation with the League of nations and with all States
outside the League which desire peace. It standard firmly for the Collective
Peace System. It demands speedy action, through the League, to bring the
war in Africa to an end, to be followed by an immediate resumption of
negotiations for all-round disarmament.

Labour will efficiently maintain such defence forces as are necessary and
consistent with our membership of the League; the best defence is not huge
competitive national armaments, but the organisation of collective security
against any aggressor and the agreed reduction of national armaments
everywhere.

Labour will propose to other nations the complete abolition of all national
air forces, the effective international control of civil aviation and the creation
of an international air police force; large reductions by international
agreement in naval and military forces; and the abolition of the private
manufacture of, and trade in, arms.

A Labour Government would also seek full international co-operation in
economic and industrial questions, with a view to increasing trade and
raising standards of living throughout the world, and removing the economic
causes of war, through equitable arrangements for access to markets, for the
international control of sources of supply of raw materials, and for the
extension of the mandate system for colonial territories.

A bold policy of Socialist Reconstruction

At home, the Labour Party will pursue its policy of Socialist Reconstruction.
Labour has already put before the country, boldly and clearly, schemes of
public ownership for the efficient conduct, in the national interest, of

http://labourmanifesto.com/1935/1935-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 3

1935 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:10

banking, coal and its products, transport, electricity, iron and steel, and
cotton.

It has also declared for the public ownership of land, in order that the
community should profit by its value and proper use, the reorganisation of
agriculture, the introduction of unemployment insurance for farm workers,
the abolition of the 'tied' cottage, and the provision of cheap cottages in the
countryside.

Labour is pledged to a comprehensive programme of industrial legislation,
so as to secure reasonable hours and conditions of employment for all
workers and adequate compensation for the accidents of working life. It
would restore the freedom of Trade Unions lost through the Trade Disputes
and the Trade Unions Act. It would repeal the unjust and penal tax which the
Government has imposed upon Co-operative Societies.

Labour in power will attack the problem of the distressed areas by special
steps designed to deal with the root causes of their troubles, as part of a
vigorous policy of national planning. Labour will sweep away the
humiliating means test imposed by the 'National' Government and will
provide adequately for the unemployed, but will seek above all to reabsorb
idle workers into productive employment by far-reaching schemes of
national development. The Labour Party stands for a big move forward in
education, including the raising of the school-leaving age with adequate
maintenance allowances. It will vigorously develop the health services, and,
in particular, will treat as one of its immediate concerns the terrible and
neglected problem of maternal mortality. It favours an increase in the
amount of old age pensions and a lowering of the qualifying age. It will go
ahead with the provision of healthy homes for the people at reasonable rents,
until the needs of the nation are fully met.

Labour seeks a mandate to carry out this programme by constitutional and
democratic means, and with this end in view, it seeks power to abolish the

House of Lords and improve the procedure of the House of Commons.

Labour asks the Nation for a Parliamentary Majority to promote Socialism at
home and Peace abroad.

1945 Labour Party Election
Manifesto

 

Let Us Face the Future: A Declaration of
Labour Policy for the Consideration of the
Nation

Victory in War must be followed by a Prosperous Peace

Victory is assured for us and our allies in the European war. The war in the
East goes the same way. The British Labour Party is firmly resolved that
Japanese barbarism shall be defeated just as decisively as Nazi aggression
and tyranny. The people will have won both struggles. The gallant men and
women in the Fighting Services, in the Merchant Navy, Home Guard and
Civil Defence, in the factories and in the bombed areas - they deserve and
must be assured a happier future than faced so many of them after the last
war. Labour regards their welfare as a sacred trust.

So far as Britain's contribution is concerned, this war will have been won by
its people, not by any one man or set of men, though strong and greatly
valued leadership has been given to the high resolve of the people in the
present struggle. And in this leadership the Labour Ministers have taken
their full share of burdens and responsibilities. The record of the Labour
Ministers has been one of hard tasks well done since that fateful day in May,
1940, when the initiative of Labour in Parliament brought about the fall of
the Chamberlain Government and the formation of the new War Government
which has led the country to victory.

The people made tremendous efforts to win the last war also. But when they
had won it they lacked a lively interest in the social and economic problems
of peace, and accepted the election promises of the leaders of the anti-
Labour parties at their face value. So the ""hard-faced men who had done
well out of the war"" were able to get the kind of peace that suited
themselves. The people lost that peace. And when we say ""peace"" we mean
not only the Treaty, but the social and economic policy which followed the
fighting.

In the years that followed, the ""hard-faced men"" and their political friends
kept control of the Government. They controlled the banks, the mines, the
big industries, largely the press and the cinema. They controlled the means
by which the people got their living. They controlled the ways by which
most of the people learned about the world outside. This happened in all the

http://labourmanifesto.com/1945/1945-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 12

1945 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:10
big industrialised countries.

Great economic blizzards swept the world in those years. The great inter-war
slumps were not acts of God or of blind forces. They were the sure and
certain result of the concentration of too much economic power in the hands
of too few men. These men had only learned how to act in the interest of
their own bureaucratically-run private monopolies which may be likened to
totalitarian oligarchies within our democratic State. They had and they felt
no responsibility to the nation.

Similar forces are at work today. The interests have not been able to make
the same profits out of this war as they did out of the last. The determined
propaganda of the Labour Party, helped by other progressive forces, had its
effect in ""taking the profit out of war"". The 100% Excess Profits Tax, the
controls over industry and transport, the fair rationing of food and control of
prices - without which the Labour Party would not have remained in the
Government - these all helped to win the war. With these measures the
country has come nearer to making ""fair shares"" the national rule than ever
before in its history.

But the war in the East is not yet over. There are grand pickings still to be
had. A short boom period after the war, when savings, gratuities and post-
war credits are there to be spent, can make a profiteer's paradise. But Big
Business knows that this will happen only if the people vote into power the
party which promises to get rid of the controls and so let the profiteers and
racketeers have that freedom for which they are pleading eloquently on
every Tory platform and in every Tory newspaper.

They accuse the Labour Party of wishing to impose controls for the sake of
control. That is not true, and they know it. What is true is that the anti-
controllers and anti-planners desire to sweep away public controls, simply in
order to give the profiteering interests and the privileged rich an entirely free
hand to plunder the rest of the nation as shamelessly as they did in the
nineteen-twenties.

Does freedom for the profiteer mean freedom for the ordinary man and
woman, whether they be wage-earners or small business or professional men
or housewives? Just think back over the depressions of the 20 years between
the wars, when there were precious few public controls of any kind and the
Big Interests had things all their own way. Never was so much injury done to
so many by so few. Freedom is not an abstract thing. To be real it must be
won, it must be worked for.

The Labour Party stands for order as against the chaos which would follow
the end of all public control. We stand for order, for positive constructive
progress as against the chaos of economic do-as-they-please anarchy.

The Labour Party makes no baseless promises. The future will not be easy.

But this time the peace must be won. The Labour Party offers the nation a
plan which will win the Peace for the People.

1945 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:10

What the Election will be about

Britain's coming Election will be the greatest test in our history of the
judgement and common sense of our people.

The nation wants food, work and homes. It wants more than that - it wants
good food in plenty, useful work for all, and comfortable, labour - saving
homes that take full advantage of the resources of modern science and
productive industry. It wants a high and rising standard of living, security for
all against a rainy day, an educational system that will give every boy and
girl a chance to develop the best that is in them.

These are the aims. In themselves they are no more than words. All parties
may declare that in principle they agree with them. But the test of a political
programme is whether it is sufficiently in earnest about the objectives to
adopt the means needed to realise them. It is very easy to set out a list of
aims. What matters is whether it is backed up by a genuine workmanlike
plan conceived without regard to sectional vested interests and carried
through

Point by point these national aims need analysis. Point by point it will be
found that if they are to be turned into realities the nation and its post-war
Governments will be called upon to put the nation above any sectional
interest, above any free enterprise. The problems and pressures of the post-
war world threaten our security and progress as surely as - though less
dramatically than - the Germans threatened them in 1940. We need the spirit
of Dunkirk and of the Blitz sustained over a period of years.

The Labour Party's programme is a practical expression of that spirit applied
to the tasks of peace. It calls for hard work, energy and sound sense.

We must prevent another war, and that means we must have such an
international organisation as will give all nations real security against future
aggression. But Britain can only play her full part in such an international
plan if our spirit as shown in our handling of home affairs is firm, wise and
determined. This statement of policy, therefore, begins at home.

And in stating it we give clear notice that we will not tolerate obstruction of
the people's will by the House of Lords.

The Labour Party stands for freedom - for freedom of worship, freedom of
speech, freedom of the Press. The Labour Party will see to it that we keep
and enlarge these freedoms, and that we enjoy again the personal civil
liberties we have, of our own free will, sacrificed to win the war. The
freedom of the Trade Unions, denied by the Trade Disputes and Trade
Unions Act, 1927, must also be restored. But there are certain so-called
freedoms that Labour will not tolerate: freedom to exploit other people;
freedom to pay poor wages and to push up prices for selfish profit; freedom
to deprive the people of the means of living full, happy, healthy lives.

The nation needs a tremendous overhaul, a great programme of

http://labourmanifesto.com/1945/1945-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 12

1945 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:10

modernisation and re-equipment of its homes, its factories and machinery, its
schools, its social services.

All parties say so - the Labour Party means it. For the Labour Party is
prepared to achieve it by drastic policies and keeping a firm constructive
hand on our whole productive machinery; the Labour Party will put the
community first and the sectional interests of private business after. Labour
will plan from the ground up - giving an appropriate place to constructive
enterprise and private endeavour in the national plan, but dealing decisively
with those interests which would use high-sounding talk about economic
freedom to cloak their determination to put themselves and their wishes
above those of the whole nation.

Jobs for All

All parties pay lip service to the idea of jobs for all. All parties are ready to
promise to achieve that end by keeping up the national purchasing power
and controlling changes in the national expenditure through Government
action. Where agreement ceases is in the degree of control of private
industry that is necessary to achieve the desired end.

In hard fact, the success of a full employment programme will certainly turn
upon the firmness and success with which the Government fits into that
programme the investment and development policies of private as well as
public industry.

Our opponents would be ready to use State action to do the best they can to
bolster up private industry whenever it plunges the nation into heavy
unemployment. But if the slumps in uncontrolled private industry are too
severe to be balanced by public action - as they will certainly prove to be -
our opponents are not ready to draw the conclusion that the sphere of public
action must be extended.

They say, ""Full employment. Yes! If we can get it without interfering too
much with private industry."" We say, ""Full employment in any case, and if
we need to keep 8 firm public hand on industry in order to get jobs for all,
very well. No more dole queues, in order to let the Czars of Big Business
remain kings in their own castles. The price of so-called ‘economic freedom'
for the few is too high if it is bought at the cost of idleness and misery for
millions.""

What will the Labour Party do?

First, the whole of the national resources, in land, material and labour must
be fully employed. Production must be raised to the highest level and related
to purchasing power. Over-production is not the cause of depression and
unemployment; it is under-consumption that is responsible. It is doubtful
whether we have ever, except in war, used the whole of our productive
capacity. This must be corrected because, upon our ability to produce and
organise a fair and generous distribution of the product, the standard of

http://labourmanifesto.com/1945/1945-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 12

1945 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:10
living of our people depends.

Secondly, a high and constant purchasing power can be maintained through
good wages, social services and insurance, and taxation which bears less
heavily on the lower income groups. But everybody knows that money and
savings lose their value if prices rise so rents and the prices of the necessities
of life will be controlled.

Thirdly, planned investment in essential industries and on houses, schools,
hospitals and civic centres will occupy a large field of capital expenditure. A
National Investment Board will determine social priorities and promote
better timing in private investment. In suitable cases we would transfer the
use of efficient Government factories from war production to meet the needs
of peace. The location of new factories will be suitably controlled and where
necessary the Government will itself build factories. There must be no
depressed areas in the New Britain.

Fourthly, the Bank of England with its financial powers must be brought
under public ownership, and the operations of the other banks harmonised
with industrial needs.

By these and other means full employment can be achieved. But a policy of
Jobs for All must be associated with a policy of general economic expansion
and efficiency as set out in the next section of this Declaration. Indeed, it is
not enough to ensure that there are jobs for all. If the standard of life is to be
high - as it should be - the standard of production must be high. This means
that industry must be thoroughly efficient if the needs of the nation are to be
met.

Industry in the Service of the Nation

By the test of war some industries have shown themselves capable of rising
to new heights of efficiency and expansion. Others, including some of our
older industries fundamental to our economic structure, have wholly or
partly failed.

Today we live alongside economic giants - countries where science and
technology take leaping strides year by year. Britain must match those
strides - and we must take no chances about it. Britain needs an industry
organised to enable it to yield the best that human knowledge and skill can
provide. Only so can our people reap the full benefits of this age of
discovery and Britain keep her place as a Great Power.

The Labour Party intends to link the skill of British craftsmen and designers
to the skill of British scientists in the service of our fellow men. The genius
of British scientists and technicians who have produced radio-location, jet
propulsion, penicillin. and the Mulberry Harbours in wartime, must be given
full rein in peacetime too.

Each industry must have applied to it the test of national service. If it serves

http://labourmanifesto.com/1945/1945-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 12

1945 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

the nation, well and good; if it is inefficient and falls down on its job, the
nation must see that things are put right.

These propositions seem indisputable, but for years before the war anti-
Labour Governments set them aside, so that British industry over a large
field fell into a state of depression, muddle and decay. Millions of working
and middle class people went through the horrors of unemployment and
insecurity. It is not enough to sympathise with these victims: we must
develop an acute feeling of national shame - and act.

The Labour Party is a Socialist Party, and proud of it. Its ultimate purpose at
home is the establishment of the Socialist Commonwealth of Great Britain -
free, democratic, efficient, progressive, public-spirited, its material resources
organised in the service of the British people.

But Socialism cannot come overnight, as the product of a week-end
revolution. The members of the Labour Party, like the British people, are
practical-minded men and women.

There are basic industries ripe and over-ripe for public ownership and
management in the direct service of the nation. There are many smaller
businesses rendering good service which can be left to go on with their
useful work.

There are big industries not yet ripe for public ownership which must
nevertheless be required by constructive supervision to further the nation's
needs and not to prejudice national interests by restrictive anti-social
monopoly or cartel agreements - caring for their own capital structures and
profits at the cost of a lower standard of living for all.

In the light of these considerations, the Labour Party submits to the nation
the following industrial programme:

1. Public ownership of the fuel and power industries. For a quarter of a
century the coal industry, producing Britain's most precious national
raw material, has been floundering chaotically under the ownership of
many hundreds of independent companies. Amalgamation under
public ownership will bring great economies in operation and make it
possible to modernise production methods and to raise safety
standards in every colliery in the country. Public ownership of gas and
electricity undertakings will lower charges, prevent competitive waste,
open the way for co-ordinated research and development, and lead to
the reforming of uneconomic areas of distribution. Other industries
will benefit.

2. Public ownership of inland transport. Co-ordination of transport
services by rail, road, air and canal cannot be achieved without
unification. And unification without public ownership means a steady
struggle with sectional interests or the enthronement of a private
monopoly, which would be a menace to the rest of industry.

3. Public ownership of iron and steel. Private monopoly has maintained
high prices and kept inefficient high-cost plants in existence. Only if

Page 6 of 12

1945 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:10

public ownership replaces private monopoly can the industry become
efficient.

These socialised industries, taken over on a basis of fair
compensation, to be conducted efficiently in the interests of
consumers, coupled with proper status and conditions for the workers
employed in them.

4. Public supervision of monopolies and cartels with the aim of
advancing ;industrial efficiency in the service of the nation. Anti-
social restrictive practices will be prohibited.

5. A firm and clear-cut programme for the export trade. We would give
State help in any necessary form to get our export trade on its feet and
enable it to pay for the food and raw materials without which Britain
must decay and die. But State help on conditions - conditions that
industry is efficient and go-ahead. Laggards and obstructionists must
be led or directed into better ways. Here we dare not fail.

6. The shaping of suitable economic and price controls to secure that first
things shall come first in the transition from war to peace and that
every citizen (including the demobilised Service men and women)
shall get fair play. There must be priorities in the use of raw materials,
food prices must be held, homes for the people for all before luxuries
for the few. We do not want a short boom followed by collapse as after
the last war; we do not want a wild rise in prices and inflation,
followed by a smash and widespread unemployment. It is either sound
economic controls - or smash.

7. The better organisation of Government departments and the Civil
Service for work in relation to these ends. The economic purpose of
government must be to spur industry forward and not to choke it with
red tape.

Agriculture and The People's Food

Agriculture is not only a job for the farmers; it is also a way of feeding the
people. So we need a prosperous and efficient agricultural industry ensuring
a fair return for the farmer and farm worker without excessive prices to the
consumer. Our agriculture should be planned to give us the food we can best
produce at home, and large enough to give us as much of those foods as
possible.

In war time the County War Executive Committees have organised
production in that way. They have been the means of increasing efficiency
and have given much practical assistance, particularly to the small farmer.
The Labour Party intends that, with suitable modifications and safeguards,
their work shall continue in peacetime.

Our good farm lands are part of the wealth of the nation and that wealth
should not be wasted. The land must be farmed, not starved. If a landlord
cannot or will not provide proper facilities for his tenant farmers, the State
should take over his land at a fair valuation. The people need food at prices
they can afford to pay. This means that our food supplies will have to be
planned. Never again should they be left at the mercy of the city financier or

http://labourmanifesto.com/1945/1945-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 12

1945 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:10

speculator. Instead there must be stable markets, to the great gain of both
producer and consumer.

The Ministry of Food has done fine work for the housewife in war. The
Labour Party intends to keep going as much of the work of the Ministry of
Food as will be useful in peace conditions, including the bulk purchase of
food from abroad and a well organised system of distribution at home, with
no vested interests imposing unnecessary costs.

A Labour Government will keep the new food services, such as the factory
canteens and British restaurants, free and cheap milk for mothers and
children, fruit juices and food supplements, and will improve and extend
these services.

Houses and the Building Programme

Everybody says that we must have houses. Only the Labour Party is ready to
take the necessary steps - a full programme of land planning and drastic
action to ensure an efficient building industry that will neither burden the
community with a crippling financial load nor impose bad conditions and
heavy unemployment on its workpeople. There must be no restrictive price
rings to keep up prices and bleed the taxpayer, the owner-occupier and the
tenant alike. Modern methods, modern materials will have to be the order of
the day.

There must be a due balance between the housing programme, the building
of schools and the urgent requirements of factory modernisation and
construction which will enable industry to produce efficiently.

Housing will be one of the greatest and one of the earliest tests of a
Government's real determination to put the nation first. Labour's pledge is
firm and direct - it will proceed with a housing programme with the
maximum practical speed until every family in this island has a good
standard of accommodation. That may well mean centralising and pooling of
building materials and components by the State, together with price control.
If that is necessary to get the houses as it was necessary to get the guns and
planes, Labour is ready.

And housing ought to be dealt with in relation to good town planning -
pleasant surroundings, attractive lay-out, efficient utility services, including
the necessary transport facilities.

There should be a Ministry of Housing and Planning combining the housing
powers of the Ministry of Health with the planning powers of the Ministry of
Town and Country Planning; and there must be a firm and united
Government policy to enable the Ministry of Works to function as an
efficient instrument in the service of all departments with building needs and
of the nation as a whole.

The Land

http://labourmanifesto.com/1945/1945-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 12

1945 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:10

In the interests of agriculture, housing and town and country planning alike,
we declare for a radical solution for the crippling problems of land
acquisition and use in the service of the national plan.

Labour believes in land nationalisation and will work towards it, but as a
first step the State and the local authorities must have wider and speedier
powers to acquire land for public purposes wherever the public interest so
requires. In this regard and for the purposes of controlling land use under
town and country planning, we will provide for fair compensation; but we
will also provide for a revenue for public funds from ""betterment"".

Education and Recreation

An important step forward has been taken by the passing of the recent
Education Act. Labour will put that Act not merely into legal force but into
practical effect, including the raising of the school leaving age to 16 at the
earliest possible moment, ""further"" or adult education, and free secondary
education for all.

And, above all, let us remember that the great purpose of education is to give
us individual citizens capable of thinking for themselves.

National and local authorities should co-operate to enable people to enjoy
their leisure to the full, to have opportunities for healthy recreation. By the
provision of concert halls, modern libraries, theatres and suitable civic
centres, we desire to assure to our people full access to the great heritage of
culture in this nation.

Health of the Nation and its Children

By good food and good homes, much avoidable ill-health can be prevented.
In addition the best health services should be available free for all. Money
must no longer be the passport to the best treatment.

In the new National Health Service there should be health centres where the
people may get the best that modern science can offer, more and better
hospitals, and proper conditions for our doctors and nurses. More research is
required into the causes of disease and the ways to prevent and cure it.

Labour will work specially for the care of Britain's mothers and their
children - children's allowances and school medical and feeding services,
better maternity and child welfare services. A healthy family life must be
fully ensured and parenthood must not be penalised if the population of
Britain is to be prevented from dwindling.

Social Insurance against the Rainy Day

The Labour Party has played a leading part in the long campaign for proper
social security for all - social provision against rainy days, coupled with

http://labourmanifesto.com/1945/1945-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 12

1945 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:10

economic policies calculated to reduce rainy days to a minimum. Labour led
the fight against the mean and shabby treatment which was the lot of
millions while Conservative Governments were in power over long years. A
Labour Government will press on rapidly with legislation extending social
insurance over the necessary wide field to all.

But great national programmes of education, health and social services are
costly things. Only an efficient and prosperous nation can afford them in full
measure. If, unhappily, bad times were to come, and our opponents were in
power, then, running true to form, they would be likely to cut these social
provisions on the plea that the nation could not meet the cost. That was the
line they adopted on at least three occasions between the wars.

There is no good reason why Britain should not afford such programmes, but
she will need full employment and the highest possible industrial efficiency
in order to do so.

A World of Progress and Peace

No domestic policy, however wisely framed and courageously applied, can
succeed in a world still threatened by war. Economic strife and political and
military insecurity are enemies of peace. We cannot cut ourselves off from
the rest of the world - and we ought not to try.

Now that victory has been won, at so great a cost of life and material
destruction, we must make sure that Germany and Japan are deprived of all
power to make war again. We must consolidate in peace the great war-time
association of the British Commonwealth with the U.S.A. and the U.S.SR.
Let it not be forgotten that in the years leading up to the war the Tories were
so scared of Russia that they missed the chance to establish a partnership
which might well have prevented the war.

We must join with France and China and all others who have contributed to
the common victory in forming an International Organisation capable of
keeping the peace in years to come. All must work together in true
comradeship to achieve continuous social and economic progress.

If peace is to be protected we must plan and act. Peace must not be regarded
as a thing of passive inactivity: it must be a thing of life and action and
work.

An internationally protected peace should make possible a known
expenditure on armaments as our contribution to the protection of peace; an
expenditure that should diminish as the world becomes accustomed to the
prohibition of war through an effective collective security.

The economic well-being of each nation largely depends on world-wide
prosperity. The essentials of prosperity for the world as for individual
nations are high production and progressive efficiency, coupled with steady
improvement in the standard of life, an increase in effective demand, and fair

http://labourmanifesto.com/1945/1945-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 12

1945 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:10

shares for all who by their effort contribute to the wealth of their community.
We should build a new United Nations, allies in a new war on hunger,
ignorance and want.

The British, while putting their own house in order, must play the part of
brave and constructive leaders in international affairs. The British Labour
Movement comes to the tasks of international organisation with one great
asset: it has a common bond with the working peoples of all countries, who
have achieved a new dignity and influence through their long struggles
against Nazi tyranny.

And in all this worth-while work - whether political, military or economic -
the Labour Party will seek to promote mutual understanding and cordial co-
operation between the Dominions of the British Commonwealth, the
advancement of India to responsible self-government, and the planned
progress of our Colonial Dependencies.

Labour's Call to all Progressives

Quite a number of political parties will be taking part in the coming
Election. But by and large Britain is a country of two parties.

And the effective choice of the people in this Election will be between the
Conservative Party, standing for the protection of the rights of private
economic interest, and the Labour Party, allied with the great Trade Union
and co-operative movements, standing for the wise organisation and use of
the economic assets of the nation for the public good. Those are the two
main parties; and here is the fundamental issue which has to be settled.

The election will produce a Labour Government, a Conservative
Government, or no clear majority for either party: this last might well mean
parliamentary instability and confusion, or another Election.

In these circumstances we appeal to all men and women of progressive
outlook, and who believe in constructive change, to support the Labour
Party. We respect the views of those progressive Liberals and others who
would wish to support one or other of the smaller parties of their choice. But
by so doing they may help the Conservatives, or they may contribute to a
situation in which there is no parliamentary majority for any major issue of
policy.

In the interests of the nation and of the world, we earnestly urge all
progressives to see to it - as they certainly can - that the next Government is
not a Conservative Government but a Labour Government which will act on
the principles of policy set out in the present Declaration.

1950 Labour Party Election
Manifesto

 

Let Us Win Through Together:

A Declaration of Labour Policy for the Consideration of the
Nation

When the Labour Party published Let Us Face the Future in 1945 those five
words were more than the title of the Election Manifesto; they were five
words which crystallised the minds of our people at that time. By hard work,
good sense and self-discipline the people have laid the foundations of a
future based on free social democracy. They have helped Parliament and
Government to carry into effect all the main proposals in that Manifesto.

Now in 1950 the country is facing another General Election. We ask our
fellow citizens to assert in their free exercise of the franchise that by and
large the first majority Labour Government has served the country well. The
task now is to carry the nation through to complete recovery. And that will
mean continued, mighty efforts from us all. The choice for the electors is
between the Labour Party - the party of positive action, of constructive
progress, the true party of the nation - and the Conservative Party - the party
of outdated ideas, of unemployment, of privilege.

The New Moral Order

Socialism is not bread alone. Economic security and freedom from the
enslaving material bonds of capitalism are not the final goals. They are
means to the greater end - the evolution of a people more kindly, intelligent,
free, co-operative, enterprising and rich in culture. They are means to the
greater end of the full and free development of every individual person. We
in the Labour Party - men and women from all occupations and from every
sphere of life - have set out to create a community that relies for its driving
power on the release of all the finer constructive impulses of man. We
believe that all citizens have obligations to fulfil as well as rights to enjoy.

In contrast, the fainthearted feel that only fear of poverty will drive men to
work for the nation. 'Empty bellies'. one Tory has said, 'are the one thing that
will make Britons work.' Labour for its part declares that full employment is
the corner-stone of the new society.

The Labour Government has ensured full employment and fair shares of the
necessities of life. What a contrast with pre-war days! In those days millions

http://labourmanifesto.com/1950/1950-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 12

1950 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

of unwanted men eked out their lives in need of the very things they
themselves could have made in the factories that were standing idle.

Even when at work each man often feared that the next pay-day would be
the last. The wife feared that the housekeeping money would suddenly
vanish. Often it did. Her husband was handed his cards, he drew the dole,
then she had to make do with a fraction of her previous money - and despite
all her sacrifices the children suffered. The queue at the Labour Exchange
was repeated in the queue of small traders at the bankruptcy court. Clerks
and professional people saw their hopes destroyed and their savings swept
away by the slump.

Big Business did not believe in Britain - it believed only in profit. So money
went into cinemas, not coal; into luxury flats, not looms for Lancashire; into
land speculation, not into agriculture.

Whatever our Party, all of us old enough to remember are in our hearts
ashamed of those years. They were unhappy years for our country and our
people. They must never come again.

First Five Years

Full employment is the main, but not the only achievement. Six years of war
ate away our wealth - crippled our trade, blitzed our homes and factories,
sank our ships, and axed our overseas investments. The world has been
desperately short of food since the war. But Britain has accomplished a
recovery unsurpassed by any other country. No doubt there have been
mistakes. But judge on what basis you will - by the standard of life of the
general body of citizens, by employment, by the infrequency of serious
industrial disputes, by the stability of the nation, by social security - by any
fair comparison, the British people have done an infinitely better job than
was done after the first World War.

By explaining to the people what needed to be done, by giving the facts, by
appealing to the patriotism of the people, by vigorous, sensible leadership,
the Labour Government has led Britain to the first victories of peace. Now
let us win through together.

WORK FOR ALL

The supreme aim that we set before the nation is the maintenance of full
employment. Here is Labour's policy.

The nation's greatest need is to export more, especially to North America, so
that we can pay for enough food to eat, and enough raw materials to keep
our factories running. Labour will not dodge this problem as Tory
Governments did before the war. If mass unemployment came again, people
would once more be too poor to buy much food from abroad, and idle
factories would not need imported raw materials. If social services were cut,

http://labourmanifesto.com/1950/1950-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 12

1950 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

wages slashed and full employment lost we might once again succeed in
masking our overseas trade problem - but only at the cost of human misery,
queues at the Labour Exchange and a nation divided by industrial bitterness.
That was, and still is, the Tory way. It is not ours.

Labour's way - the way of full employment - is to produce more and to
export more, to increase efficiency and to lower costs.

Purchasing power and production must march together. Just as we have
aimed at keeping purchasing power within limits in the last few years when
there have been too few goods and too much money, so we will be prepared
to expand purchasing power if the danger is too little money and too many
goods.

Labour will encourage the introduction of equal pay for equal work by
women when the nation's economic circumstances allow it.

Finance must be the servant and not the master of employment policy. Public
owner ship of the Bank of England has enabled the Government to control
monetary policy. Subject to the will of Parliament, we shall take whatever
measures may be required to control financial forces, so as to maintain full
employment and promote the welfare of the nation.

Publicly owned industry will be ready to expand its investment when
employment policy demands it. The public sector will, by speeding up
necessary capital development, help to maintain employment.

Special measures for areas of special need. The rebuilding of the
Development Areas, which has transformed the lives of many thousands
from destitution to active work, will be vigorously continued. To aid one of
the chief industries in these Areas, a Development Council will be
established for shipbuilding and ship-repairing. Labour will take all steps
necessary to ensure that this great industry is never again neglected as it was
between the wars.

Raise Production - Lower Costs

Unless we continue to increase production as we have done in the last four
years, we cannot improve or even maintain our present standard of life; the
social services cannot advance or even survive; and our national freedom
and independence cannot continue. This is a lob for every one of us, pulling
together. Private enterprise must not shelter behind price rings and rigged
markets. Public enterprise must be vigorous, not easy-going. Drive, public
spirit and initiative are required throughout, and from us all.

There can be no advance without planning. Exports must be sold in the right
markets at the right price, and imports arranged according to our needs. Only
by price control and rationing can fair shares of scarce goods be ensured.
Only control over capital investment, distribution of industry, industrial
building and foreign exchange can enable us to overcome the dollar shortage

1950 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

and build up a permanently thriving national economy. Yet many Tories still
cry ‘Scrap controls'. Nothing could be more disastrous.

Industrial Democracy

We have begun to build up a flourishing partnership between Government,
management and workers. More has to be done, both in public and private
enterprise. Too many managements still pay lip-service to joint consultation
and then do little to make it effective. They should consult with workers'
representatives before decisions affecting them are taken, and not after; they
should make available to these representatives the accounts and records on
which managerial decisions are based. Upon the trade unions lies the
responsibility for further equipping and training their members for service to
industry and the country.

THE SOCIALISED INDUSTRIES

The long decline and demoralisation of the coal industry has been halted. In
1949 out put was 28 million tons higher than in 1945. Output per manshift -
the best measure of efficiency - has gone up steadily and is now above the
1938 level. For the first time British miners are getting a square deal. Justice
for the miner has meant fuel and power for the nation. Nationalisation of
coal has saved British industry from collapse.

The vital electricity and gas industries are able to plan ahead for expansion
on a large scale. Already new generating stations are supplying more
electricity for the home, and more horsepower for our factories.

Britain's public transport system, as road and rail services are increasingly
unified, will bring an ever better service to industry and passengers.

And when private monopoly is replaced by public ownership, the steel
industry will be responsible to the nation.

Labour will not be content until each public enterprise is a model of
efficiency and of social responsibility. The Government must be free to take
all necessary steps to that end. The initiative and public spirit of the
individual manager must be fostered. New leadership should be given its
chance to emerge. The public will be encouraged to make much more use of
the Consumers' Councils which have been created for all nationalised
industries: consumers should assume the important place which is theirs by
right as the owners of the whole concern.

Encouragement for Enterprise

Private enterprise must be set free from the stranglehold of restrictive
monopolies. Labour's aim is to give a fair chance to everybody in industry,
above all to the small concerns which have been the most ruthlessly
exploited by trusts, cartels and rings. The less efficient firms will be helped
to raise themselves to the standards of the best.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1950/1950-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 12

1950 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

Development Councils on which management, workers and the public are
represented will be set up, compulsorily if need be. The drive to apply the
results of scientific research throughout industry will be sustained. Technical
education will be extended. The Government will be ready in suitable cases
to provide manufacturers with buildings and general purpose equipment for
sale or hire, as well as finance for approved capital expenditure.

But where private enterprise fails to meet the public interest, the
Government will be empowered to start new competitive public enterprises
in appropriate circumstances. For private and public enterprise to compete
fairly and squarely in the public interest will be good for both.

The Government will also take practical steps to prevent monopolies from
continuing to exploit the public. The Monopolies Commission has been
established to expose anti-social restrictive practices. Monopoly concerns
which cannot be dealt with in other ways will be socialised.

The private sugar monopoly was buttressed by Conservative legislation
which is due to expire early in the next Parliament. We propose that beet
sugar manufacture and sugar refining shall be transferred to national
ownership for the benefit of the consumer. Fair compensation will be paid in
this as in the other cases where it is proposed that an industry should be
transferred from private to public ownership.

The cement industry is controlled by a tightly organised private monopoly
which allows high profits to be made. Labour will convert this essential
industry to public ownership.

One industry which will be carefully examined is the chemical industry. If
necessary to assure vital national interests, Labour will transfer to public
ownership any appropriate sections of this vital industry.

Agriculture and the Countryside

We must grow more food at home. The more we grow the more there will be
to eat, and the more we shall save on imports. The nation's duty to farmers
and landworkers is to give them all the help they need; their duty to the
nation is to produce as much as they can with the greatest possible
efficiency.

Under the Tories agriculture was plunged into a depression from which it
was rescued only by war. Today agriculture is thriving. The hard work of
farmers and farm workers is taking us towards our immediate target of a 50
per cent increase in production over pre-war by 1952. There are and will be
assured markets at guaranteed prices for as much of the main products of our
farms as our farmers can produce. Labour will continue the policies which
have transformed the life of the countryside.

We have not reached the limit of British agricultural capacity. Production
needs to be raised still further. The first method of doing so is by increasing

http://labourmanifesto.com/1950/1950-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 12

the standard of efficiency. The 1947 Agriculture Act has given ample powers
to ensure good husbandry; they will be used to the full.

In the battle for food the nation cannot afford wasted land. There are still in
Britain many thousands of acres of marginal land - idle at a time when every
productive acre is needed - upon which food can and will, with Government
support, be grown. Where the job is too big for individual farmers to tackle,
public ownership will be used as the means of bringing into sound
cultivation good food-producing land not fully used.

Steps will be taken to promote more efficient marketing and preparation of
horticultural produce.

The country's natural resources must be treated and developed as a whole.
Britain's vital fishing industry will be encouraged so that its efficiency, both
in production and distribution, is further improved. Britain's woodlands will
be developed on a large scale and efficiently run by the Forestry
Commission and by private and municipal owners. Britain's minerals are an
essential and often neglected part of Britain's wealth; all suitable minerals
will be placed in public ownership.

Rural Amenities

A prosperous agriculture is the foundation of the good life for all our country
towns and villages. Labour's aim is to improve the amenities of the
countryside as fast as resources permit. Rural areas will continue to enjoy a
special provision in housing. Every year more out of date rural homes will
be replaced by good houses designed for the housewife and, wherever
possible, grouped together in sociable villages. When the Rent Restrictions
Acts are dealt with in the new Parliament, the position of tied cottages will
be reconsidered and the Unions consulted about the best means of giving to
farmworkers the security in their homes enjoyed by other workers.

Nationalisation is bringing electricity to more homes and farms every year.
In the next five years, more rapid progress will be made with rural
electrification.

Water as a National Service

Far too many rural houses, farm buildings and fields are still without piped
water. There is plenty of water - in times of flood too much - but not enough
in pipes. Great progress has been made in extending piped supplies since
1945. But the work must be speeded up still further and the whole
organisation for the purpose improved. Labour therefore proposes that water
supply should become a wholly public responsibility so that as soon as
possible plentiful water will be brought into every rural area. There will also
be an extension of drainage and sewerage for country homes and farms.

Cost of Living

1950 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

In the last five years we have waged a successful defensive battle against
inflation. Food subsidies, rationing, price control of essentials, rent control,
and the freest possible competition where supplies have been plentiful -
these are all helping to keep down the cost of living.

Food subsidies have saved the average family of four about 14s. a week on
its food bill. Tory spokesmen clamour for large cuts in the subsidies. A vote
for the Tories is thus a vote for dearer food. Labour on the other hand will
continue the present policy of subsidies as long as present circumstances
continue and the need to keep down the cost of living is paramount.

No trade union movement in the world has such a proud record as the
British. With unexampled restraint and loyalty, it has co-operated to hold
wages steady through these difficult years. The great Co-operative
Movement has also exerted a steadying effect on retail prices. It is a fine
example of democratic co-operation to meet the needs of the people.

But many prices are still far too high and a burden to every housewife. Our
aim for the future is to bring down excessive prices, by increasing the
efficiency of production and distribution. Labour proposes to overhaul
distribution in the following ways:

Fruit and Vegetables. More wholesale and retail markets under municipal
or other public ownership, together with improved storage facilities, will
reduce the present waste in marketing.

Cold Stores. The development of cold storage, an essential service in food
distribution, will be effected through public ownership.

Meat Trade. The nation needs larger supplies of better quality meat. Since
the Ministry of Food took over the importing and wholesaling of meat ten
years ago, the job has been done efficiently and economically. The present
system of distribution should be come a permanent public service.

Public Buying. Labour proposes to extend buying by public bodies so that
well-made goods can be supplied to the housewife through the ordinary
distributors at reasonable prices. This will benefit the public and the retailers,
and also maintain the supply of Utility goods.

Retailing. Competition among private retailers will be encouraged. Subject
only to the needs of town planning, any citizen should be able to open a
shop. Anti-social private agreements to keep prices too high will be dealt
with.

Value for Money. An independent Consumer Advice Centre will be set up

to test and report on the various consumer goods on the market. Good
manufacturers will be protected and unscrupulous advertising exposed.

Helping Each Other in Time of Need

Labour has honoured the pledge it made in 1945 to make social security the

http://labourmanifesto.com/1950/1950-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 12

1950 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

birthright of every citizen. Today destitution has been banished. The best
medical care is available to everybody in the land.

Great Acts of Parliament - the National Insurance, Industrial Injuries,
National Assistance and National Health Service Acts - have been placed on
the Statute Book. This social legislation has benefited all sections of the
community, including members of the middle classes. Hundreds of
thousands of middle class and professional families have been relieved of
one of their worst anxieties - the fear of the sudden illness, the expensive
operation, the doctors' crippling bills. What is needed now is not so much
new legislation as the wise development, through efficient and economical
administration, of the services provided by these Acts.

Role of Local Authorities

In this task local authorities have a vital role. The necessity to transfer some
functions has not reduced the importance of local authorities. They are
performing essential duties, above all in the expanded services of housing,
education, town planning and health. Councils have been given new powers
to provide fuller opportunities for citizens’ leisure hours. Local government
will continue to be fostered in all possible ways.

The Conservatives say they fought for Social Security. Against whom? Who
was resisting? They voted against /I> the second and third readings of the
National Health Service Bill. A year after taking office, Labour had begun to
pay out family allowances. But the Tory spokesman in the House declaimed
against this as a hasty action and said the same about the increase in old-
age pensions. When devaluation made economies necessary, they clamoured
for more drastic cuts. Can these Conservatives be trusted to safeguard the
welfare of the sick, the poor and the old?

We pledge ourselves to go forward on the sure foundations already laid. The
rate of progress will be determined by one thing only - the productive effort
of the people.

Children First

Labour has placed the needs of our children in the forefront of national
policy. Never before have our babies been so healthy; our youngsters so well
fed, clothed and shod. Labour has raised the school leaving age. New
schools are being built. The door to higher education is being opened ever
wider by the provision of scholarships and grants to Universities. More
teachers are being trained so that the size of classes - often still too large -
can be reduced. Fees in secondary schools have been abolished.

The policy of putting the children at the head of the queue will be continued.
Cheap and free milk and food supplements will go on. Education will in
every way be expanded as fast as our straitened means allow. While
improving physical standards in the schools, we should never forget we are

http://labourmanifesto.com/1950/1950-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 12

1950 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

dealing with people, not statistics, and that the community needs more and
more people of individuality who can think for themselves as co-operative
members of our democratic community.

The Old People

Labour has shown its determination to give the old people a square deal.
The guiding principle of our policy is that old age should be a time of
recreation and useful service, not a burden of loneliness and sorrow.
Pensions have been raised for old people - as also for disabled ex-
Servicemen. The Poor Law has gone, and National Assistance stands ready
to help whenever insurance cannot do the full job. Old people have benefited
much from the National Health Service. More labour-saving homes are
being built for old people.

These policies will be continued. And in the next Parliament there will be a
review of the working of the National Insurance Act in the light of the
economic situation at that time. It will be as well not to leave this review to
the Tories; old people know too much of Tory meanness for that.

Industrial Assurance

Those who supplement their standard of life in old age or protect themselves
against any of the hazards of life by voluntary saving through the Industrial
Assurance Offices should receive the best possible return for their money.
The Labour Party, believing that the interests of policyholders should be
paramount, therefore proposes that the Proprietary Companies should be
taken out of the realm of private profit and mutually owned by the
policyholders themselves instead of by private shareholders. The interests of
the staffs will be safeguarded.

A Home for Every Family

Since the war more than a million new homes have been provided. Yet in
spite of this great achievement, the demand for new homes is pressing. We
must move forward until every family has its own separate home, and until
every slum is gone. Rent controls and rent tribunals will be continued. The
law of leasehold will be reformed so as to do justice to householders,
shopkeepers and business men.

Labour intends to see that the countryside is not despoiled, that the fastest
possible progress is made with the great adventure of the New Towns and
that housing estates are developed into communities where people can enjoy
life to the full.

Recreation and the Arts

The Government has already added greatly to opportunity for the full

http://labourmanifesto.com/1950/1950-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 12

1950 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

enjoyment of leisure. We shall continue to do all that can legitimately be
done to support the Arts without interfering in any way with the free
expression of the artist.

National Parks will be established in the fairest parts of Britain. Footpaths
will be preserved and access to the countryside will be secured for all hikers
and cyclists. There is also need for more playing fields for the children, and
wherever possible these will be provided. A Holidays Council will be
established to promote more holiday centres with reasonably priced
accommodation for families.

One World of Peace and Plenty

In the days of Munich, when the Tories decided British foreign policy, the
prestige of Britain sank to its lowest ebb for a century or more.

The selfish and cowardly bungling of the Conservative Government landed
us in a war which collective security could have prevented and for which the
Government had not prepared. The Colonies were shamefully neglected and
the democratic aspirations of the Indian people met with continuous
frustration and delay. During the last five years, under Labour leadership,
Britain has regained her moral position in the Western world and has won
the confidence of many millions in Africa and Asia. By applying the moral
principles of Socialism to our relations with other peoples, the Labour
Government has made Britain a symbol of justice and social advance.

We will continue if returned to power, to work realistically for peace. We will
stand firm against any attempt to intimidate us or to undermine our position
in the world. But we will remain ready at any moment to co-operate fully
with Russia, as with any country that is prepared to work with us for peace
and friendship.

Labour believes that the purposes of the United Nations are best served by
still closer associations between friendly countries within the Charter. The
Labour Government has put particular energy into strengthening the
associations of the Commonwealth, the Atlantic community, and Western
Europe. These associations are, we believe, not only compatible but
necessary to each other as bastions of world security.

In Europe great strides have been taken towards the creation of a new
economic and political unity. No country has given more leadership to this
great movement than Labour Britain. We shall continue this support and
leadership in the years to come, always remembering that we are the heart
of a great Commonwealth extending far beyond the boundaries of Europe.

Unity of the Commonwealth

By recognising the desire of Commonwealth countries for complete national
self-determination, the Labour Government has immensely helped to

http://labourmanifesto.com/1950/1950-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 12

1950 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

strengthen the essential unity of the Commonwealth. In April, 1949, all the
Commonwealth Prime Ministers welcomed the free choice of India, Pakistan
and Ceylon to join the Commonwealth as full and equal members, and
accepted India's decision to be a Republic while recognising The King as
head of the Commonwealth. These decisions marked an event of epoch-
making importance. They created a bridge of friendship and co-operation
between the peoples of East and West which will prove increasingly essential
as the movement towards world-wide unity proceeds. These decisions would
never have been taken under a Tory Government in Britain.

The natural confidence and mutual affection existing between the peoples of
the Commonwealth are one of the world's greatest assets in its struggle for
stability and peace. We will continue to strengthen these powerful bonds of
union by practical measures of co-operation. Already we have vastly
expanded Commonwealth trade through long-term con tracts and bulk
purchase agreements. Moreover, by finding new sources of supply within the
Commonwealth we are helping to bridge the dollar gap.

In the Colonial territories our purpose is to help in creating the economic
and social basis for democratic self-government. Moreover we believe that
world peace and prosperity will not be secure so long as vast areas are
suffering from bitter poverty.

The Colonies are now engaged in a great ten-year plan of development and
welfare largely financed by Britain. This plan aims to root out poverty,
ignorance and disease. Since 1945, there has been a great increase,
compared with pre-war, in the volume of capital goods sent to the Colonies
to help in raising their production. Trade unionism, co-operation and social
welfare are now fostered so that this new investment shall bring freedom
instead of exploitation. A new confidence and energy are springing up
throughout Britain's territories overseas.

In the whole of our overseas policy we are proud of the new strength that our
country derives from the support of hundreds of millions in all parts of the
world who seek a way of life that is neither capitalist nor communist. To
these millions Labour Britain is a beacon of inspiration and encouragement.

Put the Nation First

We have now set before our fellow citizens the principles and policy upon
which the Labour Party will fight the General Election of 1950.

Our appeal is to all those useful men and women who actively contribute to
the work of the nation. We appeal to manual workers - skilled, semi-skilled
and so-called unskilled; farmers and agricultural workers; active and able
managers and administrators in industry and the public services;
professional workers, technicians and scientists; and housewives and women
workers of all kinds. And just as we in this declaration have put the general
public interest first, we ask the electors of all classes to do the same. For if
they put sectional interests in front of the general good of the people as a

http://labourmanifesto.com/1950/1950-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 12

1950 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

whole, they will tend to damage, not only the nation, but themselves.

The fundamental question for the men and women of the United Kingdom to
determine when they vote is this: Shall we continue along the road of
ordered progress which the people deliberately chose in 1945, or shall
reaction, the protectors of privilege and the apostles of scarcity economics
be once more placed in the seats of power, to take us back to the bleak years
of poverty and unemployment? Those years must never return.

We are successfully going forward with the great and inspiring adventure of
our time. Let us win through together.

Labour Party Election Manifesto

Labour - proud of its record, sure in its policies - confidently asks the
electors to renew its mandate.

Four major tasks face our nation: to secure peace; to maintain full
employment and increase production; to bring down the cost of living; to
build a just society. Only with a Labour Government can the British people
achieve these aims.

Peace

Our first aim is to save the peace of the world. Labour has striven hard since
1945 to bring all the nations together in world-wide co-operation through the
United Nations. We have had grievous disappointments, particularly with the
Soviet Union, but we shall persevere. We do not for one moment accept the
view that a third world war is inevitable. We arm to save the peace.

The Labour Government decided without hesitation that Britain must play
her full part in the strengthening of collective defence. Britain must be
strong: so must the Commonwealth.

But peace cannot be preserved by arms alone. Peace depends equally on
bringing freedom from poverty to lands where hunger and disease are the lot
of the masses. Britain's Labour Government has given a lead in economic
assistance to these lands. As our armed strength grows, more attention must
be given to the under-developed regions of the world. Only a Labour
Government would do this.

The Tory still thinks in terms of Victorian imperialism and colonial
exploitation. His reaction in a crisis is to threaten force. His narrow outlook
is an obstacle to that world-wide co-operation which alone makes peace
secure. He would have denied freedom to India, Pakistan, Ceylon and
Burma.

It is this that makes the election so critical, not only for the people of Britain
but for the whole world. Anxious eyes will be watching what we do. If the
election were to result in a Tory victory there would be no major power in
the councils of the Western nations represented by Labour.

Surely now, even more than ever before, it is vital to the fate of civilisation

that the voice of Labour should be heard wherever and whenever the issues
of war and peace are discussed between the spokesmen of the Great Powers.

1951 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

Full Employment and Production

Full employment through six years of peace is the greatest of all Labour's
achievements. It has never happened before. It has meant a revolution in the
lives of our people. To-day, there are half a million unfilled vacancies at the
employment exchanges. Under Labour - more jobs than workers. Under the
Tories - more workers than jobs.

Largely due to full employment, with everyone contributing to the national
product, production in Britain since 1945 has risen twice as fast each year as
under the Tories. Our industrial and agricultural output is now 50 per cent
above pre-war, but we must do better still to improve our living standards, to
fulfil our obligations in collective defence and to play our part in assisting
under-developed regions. Almost 20 per cent of the national income is now
devoted to new capital equipment for the nation. This is higher than ever in
British history.

World shortage of raw materials has steeply raised the prices of our imports
and re opened the dollar gap. The difficulties are great. But we can conquer
them.

We shall do everything possible to stimulate production at home and to
expand our exports. We shall press on with the development of new sources
of raw materials, particularly within the Commonwealth.

We shall attack monopolies and combines which restrict production and
keep prices and profits too high. We shall prohibit by law the withholding of
supplies to traders who bring prices down.

We shall take over concerns which fail the nation and start new public
enterprises wherever this will serve the national interest. We shall help
industry with scientific and technical aid.

We shall establish Development Councils, by compulsion if necessary,
wherever this will help industrial efficiency.

We shall associate the workers more closely with the administration of
public industries and services.

The British countryside which was being ruined and depopulated before the
war is more prosperous under Labour than ever before. Our farmers and
farmworkers have beaten all records in the production of home-grown food.
We shall continue the policy of guaranteed prices for the farmer and good
conditions of labour for the farmworker.

We shall further extend electricity and water supplies and sewerage in rural
areas. We shall encourage agricultural co-operatives. We shall stop the

creation of new tied cottages under the cottage certificate system as the first
step towards a just and comprehensive solution of the tied cottage problem.

Under the Tories there was never full employment. Year after year millions

http://labourmanifesto.com/1951/1951-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 5

1951 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

were with out work. The Tories gave us the distressed areas. They betrayed
agriculture; they encouraged monopolies and cartels. They are condemned
by their record.

Cost of Living

Rising world prices have increased the cost of living, but much less in
Britain than in most other countries. Our people have been sheltered against
rising prices by Labour's policy of price control; by rent control; by food
subsidies worth 12s. a week to the average family; by utility production and
by bulk purchase which has kept down the cost of imports.

Though long overdue improvements in the miners' wages and working
conditions have been made, the price of coal under nationalisation is less
than in any other country in Europe, or in the United States.

Our Government has started international discussions for a fairer distribution
of raw materials and for lower and more stable prices. Largely through this
initiative the prices of textiles and clothing, including children's clothing,
have recently been much reduced. This brings great benefit to the housewife
and is a welcome change from the previous upward movement of the cost of
living.

We hope to see this fall extend to other prices soon. With this object we shall
extend and strengthen price controls. We shall set up new auction markets in
provincial towns to reduce the price of fruit and vegetables to the housewife.
She will have fresher supplies, and when unnecessary middlemen are cut out
the grower will get better and more stable prices. We shall overhaul
marketing in other trades with the same object.

Tory policy would cause a catastrophic rise in the cost of living. They are for
high profits and against controls. They demand the abandonment of bulk
purchase. They want to end the utility scheme. They would allow landlords
to raise rents.

Social Justice

Contrast Britain in the inter-war years with Britain to-day. Then we had
mass unemployment; mass fear; mass misery. Now we have full
employment.

Then millions suffered from insecurity and want. Now we have social
security for every man, woman and child.

Then dread of doctors bills was a nightmare in countless homes so that good
health cost more than most people could afford to pay. Now we have a
national health scheme which is the admiration of the post-war world.

Then we had the workhouse and the Poor Law for the old people. Now we
have a national insurance system covering the whole population with greatly

http://labourmanifesto.com/1951/1951-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 5

1951 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

improved pensions and a humane National Assistance scheme.

Then only 39 per cent of the nation's personal incomes after taxation went to
the wage earner, and 34 per cent to rent, interest and profit. Now, following
Labour's great reforms in taxation, 48 per cent goes in wages and only 25 per
cent in rent, interest and profit.

There has, indeed, been progress, but much more remains to be done in the
redistribution of income and of property to ensure that those who create the
nation's wealth receive their just reward. Half of Britain's wealth is still
owned by | per cent of the population.

Labour will press forward towards greater social equality and the
establishment of equal opportunities for all. We shall extend our policy of
giving all young people equal opportunities in education. We shall
encourage a spirit of hope and adventure in the young.

As soon as tax reductions become possible we shall still further reduce
taxation of wages, salaries, moderate incomes and moderate inheritances.
We shall also take steps to abolish the differences between the payment of
men and women in the public services. On the other hand, we shall limit
dividends by law, increase taxation on the small minority who own great
fortunes and large unearned incomes, and take measures to prevent large
capital gains.

The Tories are against a more equal society. They stand, as they have always
stood, for privilege. In Parliament they proposed cuts in taxation on large
incomes and fought the profits tax. They opposed the dividend freeze.

In order to reduce the taxes of the well-to-do they would cut down the social
services and penalise the great mass of people. They now suggest 'some sort
of an excess profits tax'. In the interests of the nation Labour would stop all
excess profits.

They have voted in Parliament against the National Health Service, and they
condemned the Labour Government for being 'too hasty' in introducing
family allowances and raising old age pensions.

Under Labour more than 1,300,000 new dwellings have been built since the
war. We shall maintain the present rate of 200,000 new houses a year and
increase it as soon as raw materials and manpower can be spared. Most of
these houses will as now be built for rent and not for sale, and for the benefit
of those whose housing need is greatest.

We shall give security to householders and shopkeepers by leasehold
enfranchisement and by other changes in the law.

Forward with Labour or Backward with the
Tories

http://labourmanifesto.com/1951/1951-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 5

1951 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

We ask the electors to renew their vote of confidence in the Labour Party. It
is a simple choice - Labour or Tory.

Look first at the past records, for we have both made history. But what kind
of history? To-day, after six years of Labour rule and in spite of post-war
difficulties, the standard of living of the vast majority of our people is higher
than ever it was in the days of Tory rule. Never have the old folk been better
cared for. Never had we so happy and healthy a young generation as we see
in Britain to-day.

Scotland and Wales have a new vitality. The great areas of depression have
gone. There has been much devolution of administration from Whitehall and
this will be carried further.

Welfare at home, peace abroad, with a constant striving for international co-
operation - this is Labour's aim. The Tories with their dark past, full of bitter
memories for so many of our people, promise no light for the future. They
would take us backward into poverty and insecurity at home and grave perils
abroad.

1955 Labour Party Election
Manifesto

 

Forward With Labour: Labour's Policy for the
Consideration of the Nation

As we in Britain prepare to go to the poll, the Hydrogen Bomb looms over
all mankind. What can we do to meet that menace? The existence of this
terrible weapon on both sides of the Iron Curtain maintains an uneasy
balance under the threat of mutual destruction. But deterrents can at best
only give us a breathing space. We are faced with the choice between world
co-operation and world annihilation. The time is short.

The Labour Party approaches the problem in no party spirit. In April, 1954,
we moved a motion in the House of Commons asking for immediate high-
level talks. This was carried unanimously. Despite our pressure, those talks
have not taken place. Labour believes that the first task of a British
Government is to end this delay.

Labour's Policy for Peace

But to insist on high-level talks is not enough. The Prime Minister who takes
part in them must stand for a positive peace policy. Labour's peace policy is
threefold:-

1. Disarmament - Labour will ensure that Britain gives her full support to
the United Nations as the world-wide organisation for peace and
security. Ultimately the menace of the H-bomb can only be removed
by world disarmament, which covers all kinds of weapons. We shall
co-operate in any genuine plan for disarmament which provides for
effective international control, even though it involves, as it must,
sacrifices of national sovereignty. As a first step, we believe that
Britain should propose the immediate cessation of H-bomb tests.

2. Relaxing World Tension. - If the great powers are to disarm, the
causes of world tension must be attacked. In Europe the chief of them
is a divided Germany. Labour believes that the time has now come to
make another effort to achieve the reunification of Germany by means
of genuinely free elections.

In the Far East the war crisis centres on Formosa. Labour has
constantly urged that this crisis can only be overcome by the
evacuation of the off-shore islands, now held by Chiang Kai-Shek's
forces; by the long overdue admission of Communist China to the

http://labourmanifesto.com/1955/1955-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 8

1955 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

United Nations; and by the neutralisation of Formosa under the United
Nations to enable its inhabitants to make their own choice.

3. The Under-Developed Areas. - There can be no lasting peace until we
have met the most profound challenge of our time - the gap between
the highly developed industrial nations of the West and the peasant
millions of Asia and Africa. The Labour Government responded to
this challenge and earned the confidence of the colonial peoples. For
this reason alone no one is better fitted to represent Britain at high-
level talks than Clement Attlee - the man who freed India, despite
Conservative jeers of 'Socialist scuttle’.

Empire into Commonwealth

Labour worked to transform the British Empire into a Commonwealth of
free and equal peoples. We helped India, Pakistan, Ceylon and Burma to
achieve their freedom; we encouraged West Africa to move rapidly towards
self-government; and we began to tackle backwardness and poverty in
South-East Asia through the Colombo Plan.

We shall continue the transformation from Empire to Commonwealth as
each Colonial people becomes ready for independence. Meanwhile, it is our
responsibility to protect the weaker peoples from being exploited, and to
develop communities free from racial and colour discrimination.

Defence

Faced with actual aggression in Korea and the threat of it elsewhere, the
Labour Government did not shirk the heavy burden of rearmament. It took
the lead in building up the North Atlantic Alliance.

We believe that in the absence of all-round disarmament, the democratic
powers must be strong and united, and their defensive power sufficient to
deter aggression. But recently, after three years of Tory Government and
despite heavy defence expenditure, grave deficiencies have been revealed
both in the equipment of the Royal Air Force and in the use of man power in
the Services.

A Labour Government will at once submit all problems of defence to a
searching inquiry. In particular, it will review the period of National Service.

The Cost of Living

The Tories' main claim is that the nation is more prosperous as the result of
their decision to scrap socialist planning and return to a free-for-all to suit
big business. What are the facts? Industrial production - the key to prosperity
- has gone up since they took office at only half the rate by which it rose
while Labour was in power. Exports have hardly increased at all since 1951.
They went up in the last three years of the Labour Government ten times as

fast as under the Tories.

Our gold and dollar reserves have been falling for the past nine months, and
to-day they are two hundred million pounds less than they were at the time
of the last General Election.

Such improvements as there have been in the last three years have been,
mostly due to the movement of world prices in our favour which has reduced
the cost of our imports. Moreover, the gain has been precarious and most
unfairly distributed.

Dividends have gone up faster than wages or salaries. Speculators and
investors, whose shares have risen in value 50 per cent. in the last two years,
have done best of all. Even the long overdue increase in pensions is being
financed by making workers and employers pay a shilling a week more in
contributions.

It was the policy of the Labour Government to protect consumers from the
full effect of rising world prices; and up to 1951 the cost of living rose far
less here than in other countries.

The Tories fought last time on a pledge to bring prices down, and Mr. Butler
promised not to cut food subsidies. In less than a year he broke this promise,
and thus deliberately drove up the cost of living. Although import prices are
down by 3s. in the pound, prices in the shops at home have continued to rise
and food in particular costs 4s. in the pound more than in 1951. This, of
course, has hit hardest the old age pensioners and others living on small
incomes.

Labour's policy is to keep the cost of living steady

1. by long-term agreements with Commonwealth countries;

2. by firm action against monopolies which, through price-fixing and
restrictive practices, exploit the public;

3. by cutting out waste in the present antiquated system of food
distribution; and

4. by re-imposing price-controls on essential goods where necessary.

The charge that a Labour Government would re-introduce rationing is a
deliberate Tory lie.

A Fair Deal for the Consumer

Labour will take powers to protect the public against shoddy goods and
unscrupulous trade practices, and enforce clean food standards in shops and
restaurants.

We will encourage manufacturers to produce better goods by enforcing
quality standards and accurate labelling.

We shall establish a Consumers' Advisory Service.

1955 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11
Helping the Family

Labour believes that security should not be a privilege of the few but the

right of all, and is determined to assure it to every family - security in the
home, security against the burdens of old age and sickness, and an equal

chance for every child at school.

Housing

Labour believes that housing is a social service and will therefore go on
subsidising the building of houses to let by local authorities. It will also
begin to tackle the vast problem of old, rent-restricted houses in private
hands.

The failure of the Tory Rents and Repairs Acts has proved that the landlords
will not repair those houses without steeper increases of rent than even a
Tory Government would dare to permit. Labour will therefore ask local
authorities to submit schemes for gradually taking over and modernising
rent-controlled private property, subject to fair compensation. We shall help
those who wish to do so to own their own homes. We shall give leaseholders
an opportunity of purchasing the freeholds of their houses.

Health and Old Age

Through the National Health Service and National Insurance, the Labour
Government began to abolish the fear of old age, sickness and disablement
which haunted working-class life before the war. We shall go forward with
the job.

In order to restore a free Health Service, we shall abolish all charges,
including those on teeth, spectacles and prescriptions. We shall stop queue-
jumping by ensuring that the need for treatment and not ability to pay shall
be the test for obtaining a bed in National Health Service hospitals.

Now social security must be carried one stage further. In order to remove the
last taint of 'public assistance’, a Ministry of Social Welfare will be
established to take over the work not only of the Ministry of Pensions and
National Insurance, but also of the National Assistance Board.

To maintain the real purchasing power of these benefits, pensions and
allowances, we shall institute an annual review, and in any year in which
there has been an increase in the cost of living, the scale of payments will be
increased accordingly.

One of the first acts of the next Labour Government will be to improve the
rates of National Assistance fixed last February by the Tory Government, an
increase which we regard as quite inadequate. We shall also deal with the
anomalies of the National Insurance and Industrial Injuries schemes.

We welcome the growth of superannuation schemes in industry and

http://labourmanifesto.com/1955/1955-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 8

1955 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

commerce as valuable additions to National Insurance pensions. We shall
consult with the T.U.C. and industry with a view to extending similar
schemes on a voluntary basis to all kinds of employment and will seek,
wherever possible, to arrange for pensions to be made transfer able.

Education

Labour is determined on a radical reform of our education service. Our first
objectives are:-

* (a) to increase the number of teachers and to improve, especially in
rural areas, the standard of our schools; and

¢ (b) to remove from the primary schools the strain of the 11-plus
examination.

This cramps the free and happy life which should stimulate the children's
early years. It penalises the children who develop late and gives an inferior
place in our education to the practical skills increasingly essential to our
industrial efficiency.

Local Authorities will be asked to submit schemes for abolishing the
examination and, to realise the fulfilment of the Education Act, 1944, we
shall encourage comprehensive secondary schooling. We shall insist on the
inspection of all private schools.

To prevent children being removed from school or denied a University
education for lack of means, a national scale of Maintenance Allowances
will be established, and every student admitted to a University will be
entitled, in case of need, to a State Scholarship.

For those who leave school at the age of 15, we shall begin to carry Out
those parts of the 1944 Education Act which make provision for part-time
education.

We shall provide more playing fields. We shall abolish the tax on sport and
the living theatre.

Television is a growing influence for good or ill. Labour will establish an
alternative public television service, free from advertising.

Fair Shares

The Tories have reduced taxes on profits and unearned income, and granted
tax reliefs which give most help to those who need help least. With their
encouragement, higher dividends are being paid at the expense of the re-
equipment of industry.

Labour will once again use the Budget as an instrument for the twin

purposes of remedying social inequality and increasing production. We shall
review the working of the tax system to ensure that it is efficient and just.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1955/1955-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 8

1955 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

We shall encourage those who earn their money by hard work and ability;
we shall assist National Savings and investment. But we shall deal firmly
with tax dodgers, and we shall see to it that a fairer share of the burden will
be carried by those who get their money too easily through excessive profits,
capital gains and the inheritance of large fortunes.

We shall speed up the repayment of post-war credits which was inevitably
delayed in the difficult years immediately after the war.

Labour re-affirms its belief in equal pay for equal work and will immediately
extend it to industrial workers in Government service and so give a lead to
industry.

Planning and Public Ownership

In order to strengthen our Welfare State still further and at the same time to
play our part in assisting the under-developed areas of the world, our own
production must rise every year. Only a government prepared to plan the
nation's resources can do this.

Labour will ensure that the claims of investment and modernisation come
first, and will use taxation policy to help productive investment - thus
providing more efficient plant and equipment for the workers.

Even the Tories have had to praise the nationalised industries for their high
rate of in vestment and advances in technical efficiency.

Public ownership of the steel and road haulage industries is essential to the
nation's needs and we shall re-nationalise them.

We shall bring sections of the chemical and machine tools industries into
public owner ship. Where necessary, we shall start new public enterprises.

The Labour Government brought new hope to the old distressed areas. The
Tory Government have scrapped many of the essential controls, and now,
once again, some areas face the danger of unemployment. Labour will use
the Development Area powers to the full, and where necessary, extend them
in order to provide new jobs.

A New Industrial Era

Atomic energy and other new inventions can bring dramatic increases in
productivity and therefore in wealth and leisure. They will also demand new
skills. To meet this demand, Labour will enlist the help of scientists, trade
unions and progressive managements, and begin a real drive for better
technical education.

We will encourage schemes of industrial democracy and introduce long
overdue legislation to improve working conditions in shops and offices.

1955 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

Full Harvest

Labour in power revitalised the countryside. Britain needs a continuously
expanding and efficient farming industry. The farmer must be able to
produce in the confidence that he will find a market. This was Labour's
policy under the 1947 Agriculture Act - a policy which the Tories are
undermining.

The housewife is paying more than she need for food because there are too
many middlemen between her and the grower. Yet the grower, too, is
threatened with insecurity again.

Labour will return to a system of fixed guaranteed prices for the main
commodities so that the farmer can plan ahead, and will abolish the costly
system of private auctions and deficiency payments.

We shall encourage the setting-up of producer marketing boards to organise
distribution more efficiently in the interests of the consumer as well as the
farmer. Advisory services and credit facilities for farmers will be improved.

Labour will cheapen fruit and vegetables by opening more markets and thus
bring the produce of our market gardens into the shops more quickly and
efficiently.

There will be a square deal for the farm worker and his family, and the
injustices of the tied cottage system will be brought to an end. Safety
regulations will be applied to farms.

Water supplies, still pitifully inadequate in the countryside, will be greatly
extended and brought under public ownership.

Labour's aim is to revive the best in country life and to bring the benefits of
modern living to our hamlets and villages.

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland

Under the Tories, there had been hunger and misery, idle pits and shipyards
and bankrupt farms. Labour in power brought new life to Scotland and
Wales. Thriving industry justified triumphantly Labour's system of controls
and priorities.

But unemployment in some parts of these countries remains high. Labour
will ensure full employment in Scotland and Wales, and will begin to
overtake Tory neglect by bringing new industries to Northern Ireland.

We respect and will safeguard the distinctive national cultures of these
countries.

Local Government

http://labourmanifesto.com/1955/1955-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 8

1955 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

Labour believes in a vigorous local democracy. But at present local
authorities do not have adequate revenue to do their job properly. Immediate
relief will be provided by the repeal of the de-rating of industrial properties.
We shall review local government structure and finance, and consider the
possibility of rating of site values.

Forward with Labour

In the dangerous world in which we live we must seek to unite all those who
earnestly desire peace and disarmament and who recognise the need for a
positive policy to remove the causes of war.

Faith, vision and enthusiasm are needed if civilisation is not to be destroyed
by man's many inventions. A Party that proudly claims for its inspiration the
brotherhood of man is best fitted to grasp the opportunity of building a world
of peace, freedom and justice.

In Britain our goal is a society in which free and independent men and
women work together as equals.

The signposts along our road are Work for All, Abolition of Want, Fair
Distribution of Income and Property, Better Education.

The powers we ask for will be used in the interests of the whole nation, fully
respecting the rights of human personality. Our aim is to make men more

truly free. In 1945, Britain started out along the path of social justice.

Now is the time to go forward with Labour.

1959 Labour Party Election
Manifesto

Britain Belongs to You: The Labour Party's
Policy for Consideration by the British People

We welcome this Election; it gives us, at last, the chance to end eight years
of Tory rule. In a television chat with President Eisenhower, Mr. Macmillan

told us that the old division of Britain into the two nations, the Haves and the

Have Nots, has disappeared. Tory prosperity, he suggested, is shared by all.
In fact, the contrast between the extremes of wealth and poverty is sharper
today than eight years ago. The business man with a tax-free expense
account, the speculator with tax-free capital gains, and the retiring company
director with a tax-free redundancy payment due to a take-over bid-these
people have indeed 'never had it so good'.

It is not so good for the widowed mother with children, the chronic sick, the
400,000 unemployed, and the millions of old age pensioners who have no
adequate superannuation. While many of those at work have been able to
maintain and even improve their standard of living by collective bargaining,
the sick, the disabled and the old have continually seen the value of state
benefits and small savings whittled away by rising prices. Instead of
recognising this problem as the greatest social challenge of our time, the
Prime Minister blandly denies it exists.

The Danger of Complacency

One of the dangers we face as a nation is the mood of complacency and self-
deception engendered by the vast Tory propaganda machine. The Tory
Manifesto claims that the Government has 'now stabilised the cost of living
while maintaining full employment' and that it is 'succeeding in creating one
nation at home'.

These claims are largely without foundation. The cost of living has not been
stabilised.

Full employment has not been maintained. There are many millions of ‘have
nots' in Britain.

The best way to ensure you do not reach your goal is to pretend that you are
there already.

This is what the Tories have been doing.

1959 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

We do not say that the task of combining an expanding economy with full
employment and steady prices is an easy one. Indeed it will remain
impossible until we have a Government which is prepared to use all
measures, including the Budget, in order to expand production and
simultaneously to ensure that welfare is developed and prosperity fairly
shared. Labour's five-year programme of action has been carefully worked
out to achieve these aims.

The Truth about Production

Rising living standards depend upon a steady expansion of production. The
Tory record, whether measured against that of the Labour Government or of
other countries, is deplorable. Far from leading in the race for higher
productivity, Britain in these last years has been outpaced by almost every
other industrial nation.

After the Thorneycroft crisis of 1957, the Government deliberately created
unemployment in an attempt to halt inflation. Unemployment is still heavy
in some areas. Throughout the country it has led to broken apprenticeships;
and many school-leavers this autumn are having difficulty in finding jobs.

Ending Poverty in Old Age

The living standards of more than half our old-age pensioners are a national
disgrace. About a million are driven by poverty to seek National Assistance,
and another 500,000 would be entitled to receive it but are too proud to do
so. True, the small minority who draw a really good superannuation pension
are comfortably off, but they are the exception.

Our emergency plan for tackling this problem is to raise the basic pension
and other social security benefits at once from £2 10s. to £3 a week; and
their purchasing power will be maintained by an automatic increase to cover
any rise in prices that may have taken place in the previous year.

The Government have turned down both the basic £3 pension and the
guarantee of its value. All they have done is to improve slightly the scales of
National Assistance, from which no one can benefit without a means test.

The contrast between our /ong-term scheme and that of the Tories is equally
striking. Our plan for National Superannuation will not affect those already
covered by good superannuation schemes. But every other employed and
self-employed person will be brought into National Superannuation and
enjoy all the advantages of the best kind of private scheme. The scheme will
be financed by graded contributions, 5 per cent from employer and 3 per
cent from employee, and an Exchequer grant equivalent to 2 per cent of
average national earnings. In five years it will be providing a useful addition
to the basic pension. When it is in full operation, it will provide half-pay on
retirement for the average wage-earner, and up to two-thirds for the lower
paid workers, both men and women.

1959 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

The Tories have put on the Statute Book a bogus imitation of National
Superannuation, due to come into force in 1961. This does not give an
immediate increase to existing pensioners; it does not raise pensions if prices
rise; it does not cover those earning less than £9 a week; and, though the
contributions are heavy, it does not provide anything approaching half-pay
on retirement. Indeed, only a third of the graded contribution comes back in
graded benefit to the contributor. The rest is taken by the Chancellor for
other purposes.

The Tory scheme is really a financial device for shifting most of the burden
of paying for pensions from the better-off taxpayers to workers earning
between £9 and £15 a week.

Widows

Among widows - especially widowed mothers with growing children - there
is a great deal of hardship and want. We shall review all widows' pensions,
paying particular attention to the earnings rule, and increase to £1 the basic
pension of the '10s. widow'.

Education

Money spent on education is an investment for the future. We propose,
therefore, a great drive to abolish slum schools, to reduce the size of classes
to 30 in primary and secondary schools, and to expand facilities for technical
and other higher education.

One of the greatest barriers to equality of opportunity in our schools is the
segregation of our children into grammar and other types of school at the age
of 11. This is why we shall get rid of the 11-plus examination. The Tories
say this means abolishing the grammar schools. On the contrary, it means
that grammar-school education will be open to all who can benefit by it. In
our system of comprehensive education we do not intend to impose one
uniform pattern of school. Local authorities will have the right to decide how
best to apply the comprehensive principle.

At present, children whose parents cannot pay fees often suffer from an
unfair disadvantage in secondary education. By improving the system of
maintenance grants, we shall make sure that no child is deprived of
secondary schooling by the parents' lack of money. In the same way we shall
ensure that any student accepted by a university will receive a really
adequate State scholarship.

Housing

Labour's policy has two aims: to help people buy their own homes and to
ensure an adequate supply of decent houses to let at a fair rent.

As a first step we shall repeal the Rent Act, restore security of tenure to

http://labourmanifesto.com/1959/1959-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 13

1959 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

decontrolled houses, stop further decontrol, and ensure fair rents by giving a
right of appeal to rent tribunals.

The return of a Tory Government would mean further rent increases and the
decontrol of many more houses. We say this despite the official Tory
assurance that there will be no decontrol during the life of the next
Parliament-for we remember what happened last time.

During the 1955 Election Mr. Bevan prophesied that rents of controlled
houses would be increased if the Conservatives came back to power. Two
days later the Conservative Central Office denied this, and said there was no
truth in his statement. In 1957 the Conservative Government introduced the
Rent Act.

Under the Tories, home purchasers have been subject to unpredictable and
burden-some increases of interest rates. Labour will bring interest rates
down. We shall also reform leasehold law to enable leaseholders with long
leases to buy their own homes.

Council building of rented houses has been slashed under the Tories chiefly
as a result of higher interest rates and the abolition of the general housing
subsidy. We shall reverse their policy by restoring the subsidy and providing
cheaper money for housing purposes. We shall encourage councils to press
on with slum clearance.

At the last count there were seven million households in Britain with no
bath, and over three million sharing or entirely without a w.c. The Tories
have tried to induce private land lords to improve their property by means of
public grants, with very small success. Labour's plan is that, with reasonable
exceptions, local councils shall take over houses which were rent-controlled
before | January, 1956, and are still tenanted. They will repair and
modernise these houses and let them at fair rents. This is a big job which
will take time and its speed will vary according to local conditions.

Every tenant, however, will have a chance first to buy from the Council the
house he lives in; and all Council tenants in future will enjoy the same
security of tenure as rent-restricted tenants.

Health

The creation of the National Health Service was opposed by the Tories.
Since they took office they have starved the Service of money.

Although the period of post-war scarcity is long since over, the Tories have
completed only one new hospital. As a minimum we shall spend £50 million
a year on hospital development, and we shall also restore the free Health
Service by abolishing all charges, starting with the prescription charge.

One gap in the Service is that at present no provision is made for health care
at work. We shall close that gap by creating an occupational health service.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1959/1959-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 13

1959 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

The family doctor will, however, remain the basis of health care. We shall
help him by reducing the permitted maximum number of patients, without
loss of income, and encourage

group practice by a substantial increase in the group practice loans fund. We
shall safeguard the health, welfare and safety of people employed in shops
and offices by carrying out the recommendations of the Gowers Committee.

We shall also establish a free chiropody service for old people.

Leisure

As our plan for expansion develops, people will be increasingly able to
choose between more money and more leisure. How the balance is struck is
largely a matter for the trade unions in negotiation with the employers. How
leisure is spent is a matter for the individual. Governments should not
interfere in either. The individual, however, can only have real freedom to
use his leisure as he wants to if proper facilities are available to all and not
merely to a privileged few; and this is where both the Government and the
local authorities can help.

We shall make much better provision for the enjoyment of sport, the arts and
the countryside. A Sports Council will be set up with a grant of £5 million.
The Arts Council grant will be increased by £4 million annually. The
National Theatre will be established. In order to ensure that the countryside
is open for the enjoyment of all, the powers of the National Parks
Commission will be increased.

We shall get rid of out-of-date restrictions on personal liberty. Anomalies in
the betting laws will be removed; an enquiry will be held into the Sunday
observance laws; and a Royal Commission will be set up to review and
recommend changes in the licensing laws. But, as these are all matters of
conscience, there will be free votes on them for Labour M.P.s.

We do not propose to end commercial television, but evasions of the
Television Act must stop. When it is technically possible we shall welcome a
third choice of television programme. There is a strong case for granting this
neither to the B.B.C. nor to the I.T.A. but to a new public corporation. But a
decision will be deferred until the views of an in dependent committee have
been obtained.

Labour will end the Cinema Entertainments Duty.

Youth

The Youth Service, which should provide recreation for boys and girls
leaving school, has, year after year, been starved of funds. Many youth club
premises are dingy and unattractive, trained leaders are too few, and
facilities for sports and games are quite in adequate.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1959/1959-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 13

1959 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

Over the next five years we have got to cater for a million more teenagers
leaving school. Our new Sports Council will go some way to meet their
needs. But we shall also require (1) a sustained drive to re-equip the whole
youth service, (2) a rapid increase of apprenticeships and other forms of
training, and (3) economic expansion sufficient to provide a million new
jobs.

We are also convinced that the affairs of the community will benefit from
more active participation by young people. Among the many proposals
which Labour will consider is the lowering of the voting age. As this would
be a major change in our electoral law and social practice, we shall in the
next Parliament initiate discussions on it with the other parties.

Taxation - and Planned Expansion

Tory propagandists allege that a Labour Government would have to put up
taxes in order to pay for these improved social services. This is quite untrue.
The finance required would be raised in two ways. The chief way of raising
it will be through planned expansion. For four years under the Tories
industrial production scarcely rose. In 1958 alone this cost the country
£1,700 million, of which the Exchequer would have received £450 million.

With this increased revenue we could have paid for great improvements in
the welfare services, and we could have reduced taxation and extended the
repayment of postwar credits. So, too, the steadily expanding national
income will enable us to pay for our five-year programme with out
increasing the present rates of taxation.

Secondly, we shall change the tax system to deal with the tax-dodgers and
limit tax- free benefits. These benefits are now so extensive and lavish that
the ordinary wage or salary earner who has no access to them pays more
than his fair share of taxation.

In particular:

1. We shall deal with the business man's expense account
racket and the tax-free compensation paid to directors on
loss of office;

2. We shall tax the huge capital gains made on the Stock
Exchange and elsewhere;

3. We shall block other loopholes in the tax law including
those which lead to the avoidance of death duties and
surtax.

Public Ownership

The nationalised industries have played a great part in Britain's postwar
development. Pits have been modernised, atomic power stations built, a
massive modernisation of the rail ways started. But one crying need is to

http://labourmanifesto.com/1959/1959-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 13

1959 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

clear up the present muddle by an overall national fuel policy.

The work of our nationalised industries has been made much more difficult
by the Tories. Big business and the Tory Party itself have invested huge
sums in propaganda campaigns, designed to discredit the idea of public
ownership. Many of the Government's policies have, indeed, been activated
by prejudice-for example, their transference of work from publicly owned
railway workshops to private firms and the favouritism they have shown to
private airlines. Under a Labour Government, the nationalised industries will
be given an opportunity once again to forge ahead.

As part of our planned expansion, it will be necessary to extend the area of
public ownership. The private steel monopoly will be restored to public
ownership, in order to ensure its expansion and give the taxpayer value for
the large sums of public money still in vested in it. Commercial long-
distance road haulage will be renationalised and built into an integrated
transport system.

With half a million new cars coming on the roads each year, the
Government's road programme is entirely inadequate. But, to solve the
problem, road-building must be related to a national plan which covers all
the transport needs of an expanding economy. It must also deal with the
appalling problem of road casualties.

We have no other plans for further nationalisation. But where an industry is
shown, after thorough enquiry, to be failing the nation we reserve the right to
take all or any part of it into public ownership if this is necessary. We shall
also ensure that the community enjoys some of the profits and capital gains
now going to private industry by arranging for the purchase of shares by
public investment agencies such as the Superannuation Fund Trustees.

The Cost of Living

To achieve planned economic expansion and full employment without
raising prices requires a buoyant demand to stimulate British industry; a high
rate of investment as the basis of raising productivity; an energetic
application of science in all phases of our economic life; a favourable
balance of payments including the development of Commonwealth trade;
and a strong pound.

Under the Tories the cost of living has risen by a third. Eventually the
Government were forced to take action and apply the traditional Tory
remedy: they cut production and deliberately created unemployment.

This use of unemployment to halt rising prices is as obsolete as it is cruel.
But it is unavoidable under a Government with a doctrinaire prejudice
against controls-a Government, moreover, which antagonises the unions.
Every wage-earner realises the futility of wages chasing prices and wants to
see a stable cost of living combined with full employment. But the unions
can only co-operate if the Government, too, plays its part. If we want lasting

http://labourmanifesto.com/1959/1959-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 13

1959 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11
prosperity it must be p rosperity which is fairly shared.

Only a Labour Government is ready to use the necessary controls and able to
win full co-operation from the unions by such measures as a fair-shares
Budget policy and the extension of the Welfare State.

Consumer Protection

We shall begin a vigorous campaign of consumer protection. Buyers will be
protected against hire-purchase ramps and shoddy goods. A tough anti-
monopoly policy will lower prices and we shall make it compulsory to show
clearly the net weight or quantity of packaged goods. Existing consumer
protection organisations will be encouraged and we shall examine the need
for further consumer protection-a task in which the Co-operative Movement
will obviously have a great part to play.

PRIVATE INDUSTRY

Our policy for planned expansion without inflation requires the full co-
operation of the private sector of industry. Our tax policy will be directed
towards helping industry to mechanise, modernise and expand and make a
maximum contribution to exports. As for the industrial giants which
dominate our economic life, we shall ensure that these firms plan their
operations in accordance with our national objectives of full employment
and maxi mum efficiency.

With employers and trade unions we shall work out a Code of Conduct. This
will include a Workers' Charter, designed to raise the status of the wage-
earner and extend privileges, such as sickness pay, already provided for most
salaried employees.

Local Unemployment

One of our first tasks will be to help industries at present suffering
depression and contraction. Despite the Government's 'scrap and shut down'
policy, we shall at once put into effect our own Plan for Cotton and
guarantee to what survives of the industry a much more hopeful future.
Shipbuilding and ship-repairing is another hard-hit industry, where vigorous
action must be taken if full employment is to be restored.

Wherever there is a danger of local unemployment arising, we shall use the
full powers of the Distribution of Industry Act. The activities of the
industrial estates companies will be greatly expanded. The Government will
build 'advance' factories to encourage firms to move to places where they are
needed. Additional areas with high unemployment will be scheduled for
development purposes. From 1945 to 1951 it was Labour's policy to bring
the work to the workers. We pledge ourselves to do this again

Unemployment pay will be raised to £3 a week. By discontinuing Section 62

1959 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

of the National Insurance Act, the Tories have ended long-term
unemployment benefit. We shall restore it.

The Countryside

The Labour Government gave the farmer reasonable security for the first
time in this century; but since 1951 this security has been whittled away. It

must be restored. Protection will be given against unfair foreign competition.

The tenant farmer will obtain real security of tenure and an effective rent
arbitration system such as existed until the Tories recent wrecking measure.
A special credit organisation will be set up to provide loans at reasonable
and stable rates of interest. Agricultural co-operation will be encouraged. We
shall introduce measures to improve agricultural and horticultural marketing.

The farm worker is leaving the land. If he is to stay there he needs a better
life. We shall:

1. enable the Wages Board to introduce a 'payment during
sickness' scheme;

2. end the evils of the tied cottage; and

3. through National Superannuation provide security in old
age for workers in an industry in which there are virtually
no private occupational schemes.

Labour will also improve rural amenities. Slum schools will be abolished,
education in the countryside brought up to the town level. The publicly-
owned industries have already done much: thanks to nationalisation, 110,000
more farms than in 1948 now have electricity.

We shall carry out the long overdue reorganisation of water supplies under
public ownership. This will not only help the countryside, but industry as
well.

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland

Each of the various nations that make up the United Kingdom has its special
problems.

Labour has recognised this by issuing the policy statements Let Scotland
Prosper and Forward with Labour-Labour's Policy For Wales. The Northern
Ireland Labour Party has issued its own policy statement on the problems of
Ulster, to which Labour's National Executive has given general approval.

Labour's plans for expansion, restoring full employment and increasing
welfare will benefit all these areas. In particular we will take vigorous
measures to increase and diversify industry and to stimulate agriculture.
Improvements in communications will include such major enterprises as the
building of road bridges over the Severn and the Tay.

The time has now come for the special identity of Wales to be recognised by

the appointment of a Secretary of State.

Who goes to the Summit?

All our hopes of building a decent, happy society at home are vain without
peace abroad. Our very existence depends on ending the nuclear arms race.

This summer a new opportunity has come for breaking the East-West
deadlock. There is now every chance of the Summit Conference for which
Labour has pressed for two long years.

It seems to us that there are three tests to which anyone who claims to
represent Britain at the Summit should be prepared to submit himself.

1. Has he proved beyond doubt that he believes in
promoting the rule of law in inter national relations, and
that he rejects as obsolete the resort to violence in order to
achieve his ends?

2. Can he show by his past actions that he will make Britain
the leader in securing a disarmament agreement?

3. Has he faced, in a way that will gain the confidence of
Asia and Africa, the problem of a world divided between
rich and poor nations, subject and free peoples?

The Rule of Law and the United Nations

The Tories pay lip-service to the rule of law but ignore it whenever it seems
to conflict with their interests. That is the lesson of Suez. Ignoring an
overwhelming vote by the United Nations Assembly, they put Britain into a
hopeless military venture which split the Commonwealth and all but
destroyed the Anglo-American alliance. The Suez gamble was not only a
crime, it was also an act of folly, hopelessly misconceived, bungled in
execution and covered with a tissue of lies told by the leading Ministers
concerned, including the present Premier and Foreign Secretary. By refusing
to express any compunction or regret about Suez, Mr. Macmillan and Mr.
Selwyn Lloyd have shown the world how little respect they really feel for
the rule of law.

The Labour Party, on the other hand, upheld the decision of the United
Nations on Suez. Since then our proposals for disengagement in Central
Europe, the Middle East and the China Sea have all been designed to
substitute the rule of law and negotiated settlements for the power politics of
conflicting blocs. We have also insisted that the West should not violate the
spirit of the Charter by preventing the admission of Communist China to the
United Nations.

We have always realised, however, that power is required to make the rule of

law effective. That is why during the period of the East-West deadlock we
have stood resolutely by our defensive alliances and contributed our share to

http://labourmanifesto.com/1959/1959-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 13

1959 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

Western defence through N.A.T.O. It is our view that any weakening of the
alliance would contribute to a worsening of international relations.

For this reason we have repeatedly exposed the blunders in planning and
expenditure committed by no fewer than seven Tory Defence Ministers in
eight years. We have vigorously opposed the Government's dangerously one-
sided reliance on nuclear weapons; and we urged that highly trained, well-
paid regular forces should be substituted for conscripts.

The Arms Race

In the field of disarmament Labour has set the pace. We led the demand for
an end to all nuclear tests; after years of delay the tests are now temporarily
suspended, and we declare that, even if other countries break the truce, we
would not start our tests again but would immediately convene a new
conference. This year we have taken the lead on another urgent problem-the
spread of nuclear weapons to other countries. We have put forward the only
concrete proposals designed to stop this dangerous development and so to
leave the way open to world-wide disarmament, which is our paramount
objective. We have pro posed a comprehensive disarmament treaty which
would reduce arms, manpower and military expenditure, destroy all stocks
of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery, abolish all chemical and
biological weapons, and provide new safeguards against surprise attack.

In contrast, the Tory record has been negative and, sometimes, obstructive.
They opposed a disarmament agreement unless it was tied to the settlement
of political problems. They opposed a nuclear test agreement unless it was
part of a general disarmament agreement. They opposed the suspension of
tests when Russia offered to stop her own. They opposed Labour's proposals
for disengagement in Europe. They opposed a Summit Conference. Only
with a change of American policy and in time for a General Election in
Britain has Mr. Macmillan emerged as a sponsor of a Summit Conference.

Two Worlds

Two worlds, one white, well-fed and free, the other coloured, hungry and
struggling for equality, cannot live side by side in friendship. In their
attitudes to the Colonial and ex Colonial peoples of Asia and Africa the
Labour and Tory records stand in sharp contrast.

No action of the Attlee Government evoked greater enthusiasm than the
freeing of nearly 500 million people in India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon.
The transformation of the old British Empire into the first inter-racial
Commonwealth of free nations was the supreme achievement of the Labour
Government.

What of the Tory record? In Cyprus foolish words and a stubborn refusal to

face facts led to disturbance and bloodshed-and, in the end, the Government
had to agree to a settlement that could have been obtained years earlier. An

http://labourmanifesto.com/1959/1959-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 13

1959 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:11

opportunity to integrate Malta into the United Kingdom was thrown away. In
Kenya eleven African prisoners were beaten to death. Above all, the Tories
ignored Labour's solemn warnings that nine-tenths of the peoples of
Nyasaland and Northern and Southern Rhodesia opposed the Federation
which the Tories were forcing on them. The Government's own Devlin
Commission exposed the tragic folly of Tory policy. Mr. Macmillan rejected
its findings. After this, how can the peoples of Africa and Asia trust a Tory
Government?

Today the future of Africa is poised as perilously as that of India in 1945.
The only British Government which can regain the confidence of Africans is
a Government whole heartedly committed to three principles of the Labour
Party's Colonial policy: first, that the peoples still under Colonial rule have
as much right as we have to be governed by consent; secondly, that 'one
man, one vote' applies in all parts of the world; thirdly, that racial
discrimination must be abolished.

War Against Want

Labour has always recognised that even if the East-West differences were
ended the West is still presented with an immense challenge-the poverty of
two-thirds of the world's people. This is a challenge the Tories have never
really faced. We believe in extending the Socialist concept of the Welfare
State to all the peoples of the world. This is why we have solemnly pledged
ourselves to devote an average of | per cent of our national income each
year to helping the underdeveloped areas.

Our Socialist Ethic

Like our other social and economic policies, this pledge is based on the
Socialist belief in the equal value of every human being. This is the belief
which inspired the pioneers of Socialism, and still inspires the Labour Party,
in the struggle for social justice and human rights.

In Britain, despite the bitter resistance of those who saw their profits and
privileges threatened, great gains were won in the first half of the twentieth
century. We still have to consolidate and extend these gains: none of us,
however lucky or well-off we may happen to be, ought to feel comfortable in
a society in which the old and sick are not decently cared for.

The same principle applies when we face this vast problem of the hungry
two-thirds of the world. To solve this problem is the biggest task of the
second half of the century. We know that it can be solved-if the fear of war is
removed, and with it the crippling burden of arms expenditure.

At this historic moment a British Government with a clear policy based on
the ethical principles of Socialism can exercise a decisive influence for
peace. Hundreds of millions of people throughout the world still look to
Britain for moral leadership and eagerly await the result of this General

will be represented at the Summit by a Labour Prime Minister.

1964 Labour Party Election
Manifesto

 

""The New Britain""

The world wants it and would welcome it. The British people want it,
deserve it and urgently need it. And now, at last, the general election
presents us with the exciting prospect of achieving it. The dying months of a
frustrating 1964 can be transformed into the launching platform for the New
Britain of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

A New Britain - mobilising the resources of technology under a national
plan; harnessing our national wealth in brains, our genius for scientific
invention and medical discovery; reversing the decline of the thirteen wasted
years; affording a new opportunity to equal, and if possible surpass, the
roaring progress of other western powers while Tory Britain has moved
sideways, backwards but seldom forward.

The country needs fresh and virile leadership. Labour is ready. Poised to
swing its plans into instant operation. Impatient to apply the ""new thinking""
that will end the chaos and sterility. Here is Labour's Manifesto for the 1964
election, restless with positive remedies for the problems the Tories have
criminally neglected.

Here is the case for planning, and the details of how a Labour Cabinet will
formulate the national economic plan with both sides of industry operating
in partnership with the Government. And here, in this manifesto, is the
answer to the Tory gibe that planning could involve a loss of individual
liberty. Labour has resolved to humanise the whole administration of the
state and to set up the new office of Parliamentary Commissioner with the
right and duty to investigate and expose any misuse of government power as
it affects the citizen.

Much of the manifesto deals with the vital social services that affect the
personal lives and happiness of us all, the welfare of our families and the
immediate future of our children. It announces, unequivocally, Labour's
decisions on the nagging problems the Tories stupidly (in some cases
callously) brushed aside:

The imperative need for a revolution in our education system which will
ensure the education of all our citizens in the responsibilities of this
scientific age;

The soaring prices in houses, flats and land;

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

Social security benefits which have fallen below the minimum levels of
human need;

The burden of prescription charges in the Health Service.

Labour is concerned, too, with the problems of leisure in the age of
automation and here again Labour firmly puts the freedom of the individual
first.

""It is not the job of the Government to tell people how leisure should be
used"", the manifesto declares. But, in a society where facilities are not
provided when they are not profitable and where the trend towards
monopoly is growing, it is the job of the Government to ensure that leisure
facilities are provided and that a reasonable range of choice is maintained.

The pages that follow set out the manifesto in full. Please study it.

Why the Tories Failed

This is an age of unparalleled advance in human knowledge and of
unrivalled opportunity for good or ill. In ever-widening areas of the world
the scientific revolution is now making it physically possible for the first
time in human history to provide the whole people with the high living
standards, the economic security, and the cultural values which in previous
generations have been enjoyed by only a small wealthy minority.

Until 60 years ago when the Labour Party was founded, the ending of
economic privilege, the abolition of poverty in the midst of plenty, and the
creation of real equality of opportunity were inspiring but remote ideals.
They have now become immediate targets of political action. Britain can
achieve them provided that it resolutely wills three things: the mobilisation
of its resources within a national plan; the maintenance of a wise balance
between community and individual expenditure; and the education of all its
citizens in the responsibilities of this scientific age, not merely a small
section of them.

Since 1951, however, these opportunities of the scientific revolution have
been disastrously wasted largely because of the Conservative determination
since they took office to end the purposive planning of the post-war Labour
Government and replace it with an economic free-for-all.

As a result, successive Conservative Chancellors have been unable to get the
economy moving steadily forward. Every jerk of expansion has ground to a
full stop as the Government jams on the brake in a desperate attempt to
combat inflation and rising prices. This is why, while other countries have
made giant strides forward, our progress in the past 12 years has been so
fitful. So sharp has the contrast become that only 18 months ago a Tory
Government, driven by economic failure, lost its nerve and prepared to
accept humiliating terms for entry into the European Common Market in the
vain hope that closer contact with a dynamic Europe would give a new boost

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

to our wilting economy. Since the French veto our affairs have not improved.

Once again an election year boom is heading for a post-election ""stop"" -just
as happened after the 1959 and 1955 general elections. Indeed, by hanging
on to power to the last possible moment in the hope of gaining some
temporary electoral advantage, the Government has made the task of its
successor immeasurably' more difficult.

This chapter in our affairs must be brought to a close. Tinkering with
policies that have clearly failed and half-hearted conversion to principles
previously rejected will not suffice. Only a major change of attitude to the
scientific revolution, including an acceptance of the need for purposive
planning, will enable us to mobilise the new resources technology is creating
and harness them to human needs. Only a major change in economic and
fiscal policy can break the defeatist stop-go cycle and prevent another bout
of stagnant production, rising unemployment and declining national
strength.

Only with a new Government, with a sense of national purpose, can we start
to create a dynamic, just and go-ahead Britain with the strength to stand on
her own feet and to play a proper part in world affairs. We believe that such
a New Britain is what the British people want and what the world wants. It is
a goal that lies well within our power to achieve.

The Lessons of 13 Years

But first, what lessons must we learn from the past? Thirteen years ago,
when the Tories came to power, they claimed to have the remedies for our
national problems. The medicines they offered were first, the restoration of a
""free"" market economy in Britain; second, cuts in community expenditure in
the interests of low taxation.

The direct and crippling consequences of their free market policies are now
well known. First, it has slowed up Britain's rate of industrial expansion. Not
even the Tories' stop-go policies have been able to prevent some increase in
production and in living standards but our record is now among the worst in
the western world. If we had only kept up with the rest of Western Europe
since 1951, our national income in 1964 would be one-third more than it is -
and we should have available an extra £8,000m. of goods and services to
meet Britain's problems and to raise living standards.

The Tories still peddle their boast - ""You've never had it so good."" The truth
is that Britain could and should have had it a whole lot better, and in the
process have shown a greater concern for the needs of others.

Second, it has necessitated a stop-go economic policy, resulting in
intermittent bouts of high unemployment. A continuing excess of imports
over exports, with consequential balance of payments and currency crises
has forced the Government again and again to halt expansion and to squeeze
and freeze the economy.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

Third, it has led to growing stagnation, unemployment and under
employment in large parts of the North, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland, combined with a drift of work and people to the overcrowded
London and Midland regions.

Fourth, it has led to chaos in our transport system. with unused rail and
overused road services and an appalling congestion problem in all our cities.

Fifth, it has led to continuing inflation as companies have pushed up prices
and bid with each other for scarce labour.

Sixth, it has led to soaring land and house prices which have made it almost
impossible for local authorities to replan our towns or for many ordinary
families to buy or rent a home.

Seventh, it has led to a pervasive atmosphere of irresponsibility; to a selfish,
get-rich-quick mood, in which the public interest is always subordinated to
private advantage.

No nation in the history of human endeavour was ever inspired to become
great (or greater) with the venal philosophy of ""I'm all right, Jack"".

The consequences of their attitude to public expenditure have been no less
crippling. While public money has been lavished on wasteful military
projects, and while the Government has imposed on itself an ever-increasing
burden of interest payments on the national debt, vital community services
have been starved of resources.

In social security, we still have austerity National Insurance benefits that
impose poverty standards on the retired, the sick and the unemployed and
deny them their proper share in rising living standards.

In community services of all kinds we face such critical and neglected needs
as the rebuilding of our towns, the creation of a modern road system, the
provision of new hospitals and schools, and a desperate need for new
housing.

In education we are faced today with a chronic shortage of teachers, with
oversize classes, with far too many scandalously out-dated school buildings
and with a system of higher and further education far too small for our
minimum national needs.

No one can say, after 13 years, that Tory policies have not been put to the
test. Not only is their failure now generally recognised, it is even apparent to
the Tories themselves. The same party that began its rule with the
shibboleths of a free market economy and cuts in public expenditure, now
proclaim its conversion to economic planning and to an increased public
spending programme of no less than £2,000 m. in the next five years.

A death-bed repentance may ease the Tory conscience, but it is a cynical and
utterly unacceptable substitute for the lifelong sincerity and solidarity of the
Labour Party on this crucial issue. Tory devices - or Labour Planning?

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

A Philosophy of the Past

At the root of Tory failure lies an outdated philosophy - their nostalgic belief
that it is possible in the second half of the 20th century to hark back to a 19th
century free enterprise economy and a 19th century unplanned society. In an
age when the economy is no longer self-regulating and when the role of
government must inevitably increase, they have tried and failed to turn back
the clock.

The same backward-looking approach has prevented them from responding
to the major world changes of the last decade.

They have reacted churlishly to the rise of the new nations in Asia and
Africa, including many new Commonwealth countries, that have emerged
from the end of colonialism.

They have failed to respond to the immense new challenge of world poverty
and racial antagonism.

They have failed to understand the revolution in national defence policies
that nuclear weapons necessitate.

The effects of their policy at home and abroad are all too plain. They have
denied us the rate of expansion we could and should have achieved; they
have weakened our military power and they have reduced our political
influence in the counsels of the world.

Planning The New Britain

We offer no easy solution to our national problems. Time and effort will be
required before they can be mastered. But Labour has a philosophy and a
practical programme which is relevant to our contemporary needs. The
starting point is our belief that the community must equip itself to take
charge of its own destiny and no longer be ruled by market forces beyond its
control.

Labour does not accept that democracy is a five-yearly visit to the polling
booth that changes little but the men at the top. We are working for an active
democracy, in which men and women as responsible citizens consciously
assist in shaping the surroundings in which they live, and take part in
deciding how the community's wealth is to be shared among all its members.

Two giant tasks now await the nation: first, we must energise and modernise
our industries - including their methods of promotion and training - to
achieve the sustained economic expansion we need; second, we must ensure
that a sufficient part of the new wealth created goes to meet urgent and now
neglected human needs.

A. A Modern Economy

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

The aims are simple enough: we want full employment; a faster rate of
industrial expansion: a sensible distribution of industry throughout the
country; an end to the present chaos in traffic and transport; a brake on rising
prices and a solution to our balance of payments problems.

As the past 13 years have shown, none of these aims will be achieved by
leaving the economy to look after itself. They will only be secured by a
deliberate and massive effort to modernise the economy; to change its
structure and to develop with all possible speed the advanced technology and
the new science-based industries with which our future lies. In short, they
will only be achieved by socialist planning.

1. A National Plan

Labour will set up a Ministry of Economic Affairs with the duty of
formulating, with both sides of industry, a national economic plan. This
Ministry will frame the broad strategy for increasing investment, expanding
exports and replacing inessential imports.

In the short term Labour will give priority to closing the trade gap-
(a) By using the tax system to encourage industries and firms to export more.
(b) By providing better terms of credit where the business justifies it.

(c) By improving facilities and help for small exporters, particularly on a
group basis.

(d) By encouraging British industry to supply those manufactures which
swell our import bill in time of expansion. With proper stimulus we can
produce many of those things we are now forced to import from abroad.

But in the long run a satisfactory trade balance will depend upon carrying
out Labour's overall plan to revitalise and modernise the whole economy. It
will depend upon maintaining a steady and vigorous programme of long-
term expansion.

Tax policies will contribute directly to the aims of the national plan. They
will be used to encourage the right type of modern industry. Above all the
general effect of our tax changes will be to stimulate enterprise, not to
penalise it.

2. Plan for Industry

Within the national plan each industry will know both what is expected of it
and what help it can expect - in terms of exports, investment, production and
employment. Farmers, too, will be given a new certainty with the
establishment of commodity commissions to supervise and regulate the main
imported foodstuffs and to balance imports with home production.

If production falls short of the plan in key sections of industry, as it has done

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

recently in bricks and in construction generally, then it is up to the
Government and the industry to take whatever measures are required.

Public Ownership

The public sector will make a vital contribution to the national plan. We will
have a co-ordinated policy for the major fuel industries. Major expansion
programmes will be needed in the existing nationalised industries, and they
will be encouraged, with the removal of the present restrictions placed upon
them, to diversify and move into new fields : for example, the railways'
workshops will be free to seek export markets, and the National Coal Board
to manufacture the machinery and equipment it needs. Private monopoly in
steel will be replaced by public ownership and control. The water supply
industry, most of which is already owned by the community, will be
reorganised under full public ownership.

Science and Technology

If we are to get a dynamic and expanding economy, it is essential that new
and effective ways are found for injecting modern technology into our
industries.

The Government provides over half the money spent on industrial research
and development in Britain. Some of this research is already carried forward,
in Government establishments like the National Research and Development
Corporation set up by the last Labour Government, to the point of
commercial development. This has already led to scores of new products and
processes of which the Hovercraft and the Atlas Computer are only the most
famous.

But to get more rapid application of new scientific discoveries in industry,
new measures are urgently required. A Labour Government will

(i) Go beyond research and development and establish new industries, either
by public enterprise or in partnership with private industry.

(ii) Directly stimulate new advance by using, in the field of civil production,
the research and development contracts which have hitherto been largely
confined to military projects.

(iii) Set up a Ministry for Technology to guide and stimulate a major
national effort to bring advanced technology and new processes into
industry.

Mobility and Training

Skill, talent and brain power are our most important national resources. Yet
in Britain under the Conservatives much of the natural ability of the nation is
being wasted. In far too many firms, technicians and technologists, designers

and production engineers are held back by the social prejudices and anti-

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

scientific bias of the ""old boy"" network.

In industry, though there are some first-rate training schemes, they are few
and far between. Most young people, and particularly girls, are still denied
either adequate training at work or release for further education in technical
colleges. Older people who wish to change their jobs meet such obstacles as
loss of pension rights and the absence of retraining schemes.

Is it any wonder that the British economy has been slow to evolve? Is it any
wonder that there is widespread fear of automation or that so many of our
skilled young people have sought opportunities abroad?

Labour believes that the national plan will require a faster rate of change in
industry. To meet the human needs that will arise it is essential to combine
with our education reforms a revolution in training. We must also extend
joint consultation in industry, develop new techniques for forecasting future
manpower needs and adopt radical new measures to reconcile security with
mobility.

To this end we shall implement a charter of rights for all employees. This
will include:

(a) The right to compensation for loss of job or disturbance.

(b) The right to half-pay maintenance during any period of sickness and
unemployment.

(c) The right to first-rate industrial training with day and block release for
the young worker.

(d) The right to retraining for adult workers.
(e) The right to full transferability of pension entitlements.

(f) The right to trade union representation and proper safeguards against
arbitrary dismissal.

(g) The right to equal pay for equal work.

We shall also strengthen the factory inspectorate in order to reduce
accidents.

3. Plan for the Regions

Within the framework of the national plan, plans must also be worked out
for the different regions of the United Kingdom.

In the case of Wales and Scotland, the Labour Party has already made clear
what needs to be done by issuing the policy statements, Signposts to the New
Wales and Signposts for Scotland. As for Northern Ireland, the Northern
Ireland Labour Party has issued its own statement Signposts to the New
Ulster, to which the Labour Party national executive has given general

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

approval.

For these three nations, as for the regions of England itself, control over the
location of new factories and offices, inducements to firms to move to areas
where industry is declining, the establishment of new public enterprises
where these prove necessary - all these measures will be required to check
the present drift to the south and to build up the declining economies in other
parts of our country.

But it will not be enough to plan employment alone on a regional basis.
Regional planning is also necessary if we are to solve the problems of slum
clearance and overcrowding in our major cities; to carry out a vigorous
programme for new town and overspill development, including the proposed
new town for Central Wales; to clear up the ugly, scarred face of industrial
Britain; to save the countryside from needless despoliation; and to get the
co-ordination of higher education, further education and industrial training
required to maintain economic expansion.

To bring together the different tasks of regional planning, and the different
Ministries concerned, Labour will create regional planning boards, equipped
with their own expert staffs, under the general guidance of the Ministry of
Economic Affairs. These planning boards will work closely with
representatives of the local authorities, both sides of industry and other
interests in the region.

In Scotland and Northern Ireland more unified structures of administration

already exist. These can be readily adapted for effective regional planning.

In Wales, the creation of a Secretary of State, to which we are pledged, will
facilitate the new unified administration we need.

4. Plan for Transport

Nowhere is planning more urgently needed than in our transport system. The
tragedy of lives lost and maimed; growing discomfort and delays in the
journey to work; the summer weekend paralysis on our national highways;
the chaos and loss of amenity in our towns and cities - these are only some
of the unsolved problems of the new motor age.

Far from easing these problems, the Government's policy of breaking up
road and rail freight co-ordination, of denationalising road haulage and
finally of axing rail services under the Beeching Plan, have made things
worse.

Labour will draw up a national plan for transport covering the national
networks of road, rail and canal communications, properly co-ordinated with
air, coastal shipping and port services. The new regional authorities will be
asked to draw up transport plans for their own areas. While these are being
prepared, major rail closures will be halted.

British Road Services, will be given all necessary powers to extend their
fleet of road vehicles and to develop a first-rate national freight service.

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

Reform of the road goods licensing system must now await the report of the
Geddes Committee but, in the interests of road safety, we shall act
vigorously to stop cut-throat haulage firms from flouting regulations
covering vehicle maintenance, loads and driving hours.

Labour believes that public transport, road and rail, must play the dominant
part in the journey to work. Every effort will be made to improve and
modernise these services. Urgent attention will be given to the proposals in
the Buchanan Report and to the development of new roads capable of
diverting through traffic from town centres.

Labour will ensure that public transport is able to provide a reasonable
service for those who live in rural areas. The studies already mentioned will
decide whether these should be provided by public road or rail services.

5. Plan for Stable Prices

The success of the national plan will turn not only on the new partnership
between government and industry but on the success of new and more
relevant policies to check the persistent rise in prices. Since the Tories came
to power the value of the £ has shrunk to 13s. 4d.: it is still shrinking.

The pensioner and the housewife suffer most when prices rise. But the
nation, too, is harmed because rising prices both reduce our exports and
provoke inflationary increases in incomes.

The Tories first ducked this problem, then tinkered with resale price
maintenance. Labour will attack it at its roots: in manufactured goods,
monopoly and semi-monopoly price fixing; in agriculture, market chaos with
an ever-increasing gap between what the farmer receives and what the
housewife pays.

Labour will: (i) Give teeth to the Monopolies Commission, control take-over
bids and mergers and take powers to review unjustified price increases.

(ii) Promote more orderly marketing of our major food supplies and
encourage, in the interests of price stability, long-term contracts with
overseas producers. In addition, Labour will make sure that the consumer
gets better value for money by attacking selling rackets of all kinds, by
ensuring that goods are independently tested and accurately labelled. It will
also publicise good quality standards.

A National Incomes Policy

This is not all. To curb inflation we must have a planned growth of incomes
so that they are broadly related to the annual growth of production. To
achieve this a Labour Government will enter into urgent consultations with
the unions' and employers' organisations concerned.

Unlike Selwyn Lloyd's notorious and negative ""pay pause"", Labour's
incomes policy will not be unfairly directed at lower paid workers and

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

public employees; instead, it will apply in an expanding economy to all
incomes: to profits, dividends and rents as well as to wages and salaries.

6. Plan for Tax Reform

As essential support to a fair national incomes policy will be a major
overhaul of our tax system. Taxation must be fair and must be seen to be fair.
The present situation where the largest gains are made, not through hard
work but through the untaxed rewards of passive ownership of Stock
Exchange speculation, must be ended.

In particular we shall tax capital gains; and block up the notorious avoidance
and evasion devices that have made a mockery of so much of our tax system.

We shall also seek to lighten the burden of rates which today falls heavily on
those with low incomes. While the reform of the rate system and
investigation of alternative forms of local government finance may take
some time to accomplish, we shall seek to give early relief to ratepayers by
transferring a larger part of the burden of public expenditure from the local
authorities to the Exchequer.

Value for taxpayers' money

Labour will take urgent measures to stop the waste of taxpayers' money.
Millions spent on missile contracts, millions more on doles to private
industry, have placed an additional burden on hard pressed taxpayers.

A Labour government will apply tests of the national interest before agreeing
to subsidies for private manufacturing industries and will insist, as would
any prudent private investor, on a voice in the control, and a share in the
profits, where public funds are involved. Waste and profiteering by
Government contractors, on defence and the health service, will be
vigorously attacked.

B. MODERN SOCIAL SERVICES

Drastic reforms are now needed in our major social services. To make them
fit for the 1960s and 1970s will be costly in money, manpower and
resources. This will not be achieved all at once: but, as economic expansion
increases our national wealth we shall see to it that the needs of the
community are increasingly met. For the children, this will mean better
education; for the family decent housing at prices that people can afford; for
the sick, the care of a modernised health service; for the old people and
widows, a guaranteed share in rising national prosperity: for all of us, leisure
facilities better geared to the coming age of automation.

Education

Our country's ""investment in people"" is still tragically inadequate. The

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

nation needs and Labour will carry through a revolution in our educational
system.

(i) Labour will cut down our overcrowded classes in both primary and
secondary schools: the aim is to reduce all classes to 30 at the earliest
possible moment.

(ii) Labour will get rid of the segregation of children into separate schools
caused by 11-plus selection: secondary education will be reorganised on

comprehensive lines. Within the new system, grammar school education will

be extended: in future no child will he denied the opportunity of benefiting
from it through arbitrary selection at the age of 11. This reform will make it
possible to provide a worthwhile extra year of education by raising the
school-leaving age to 16.

(iii) To minimise the effects of the postponement of school leaving on the
large family, Labour will replace inadequate maintenance grants with
reorganised family allowances, graduated according to the age of the child,
with a particularly steep rise for those remaining at school after the statutory
leaving age.

(iv) As the first step to part-time education for the first two years after
leaving school, Labour will extend compulsory day and block release.

(v) Labour will carry out a programme of massive expansion in higher,
further and university education. To stop the ""brain drain"" Labour will grant
to the universities and colleges of advanced technology the funds necessary
for maintaining research standards in a period of rapid student expansion.

(vi) Labour will set up an educational trust to advise on the best way of
integrating the public schools into the state system of education.

The modernisation of our school system will require time and money and
manpower. In order to get the priorities right Labour will work out a phased
and costed plan for the whole of education. To assure the funds, Labour will
restore the percentage grant and transfer the larger part of the cost of
teachers' salaries from the rates to the Exchequer.

Finally - and most important - since everything depends on teachers, Labour
will give to teacher supply a special priority in its first years in office,
negotiating a new salary structure including a new superannuation scheme
favourable to part-time and elderly teachers, encouraging more entrants to
teaching and winning back the thousands of women lost by marriage.

The whole future of our education depends on the success of a crash
programme for teacher recruitment which appeals not merely to boys and

girls at school but to adults with experience of practical life that will give an
edge to their teaching.

Land and Housing

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 13:12

Page 12 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

Under the Tories, the relentless pressure of decontrolled rents, Rachmanism,
high interest rates and soaring land prices have pushed housing and flats
beyond the reach of many ordinary families and have condemned yet
another generation to squalid and over-crowded housing.

The first requirement is to end the competitive scramble for building land.
Labour will therefore set up a Land Commission to buy, for the community,
land on which building or rebuilding is to take place. Instead of paying the
inflated market prices that have now reached exorbitant levels, the Crown
Land Commission will buy the land at a price based on its existing use value
plus an amount sufficient to cover any contingent losses by the owner, and to
encourage the willing sale of land. The Crown Land Commission will not, of
course, acquire land which continues to be used for agriculture, nor will it
purchase the freehold of existing houses and other buildings so long as they
remain in their existing use.

As a result of public acquisition, building land can be made available at
cheaper prices; although the land will remain in public ownership, new
owner-occupied houses built upon it will remain, under the new
""Crownhold"" system, the absolute property of their owners as long as the
house stands.

At the same time, we shall go ahead with a sustained programme to provide
more homes at prices that ordinary people can afford.

Labour will:

(i) Introduce a policy of lower interest rates for housing. It is impossible to
say now what changes will be required in the general interest rate structure
of the market. But because of its great importance to the family housing
should be treated as a separate case deserving specially favourable
borrowing rates.

This policy of specially favourable rates will apply both to intending owner-
occupiers and to local authorities building houses to let. We should like this
policy to apply to all owner-occupiers, but unless interest rates generally fall,
it would be too expensive. We will, however, review' the problem and see
whether, and in what form, help could be extended to hard pressed existing
owner-occupiers.

(ii) Further help the owner-occupiers by providing 100 per cent. mortgages
through local councils; by advancing funds to the building societies so that
they can reduce the deposits required on old houses; by reducing
conveyancing and land registration charges; by insisting on measures to
stamp out jerry-building on new houses and by encouraging local authorities
to develop advisory and other social services to assist the owner-occupier.

(111) Repeal the notorious Rent Act, end further decontrol and restore

security of tenure to those in already decontrolled rented flats and houses.
We shall provide machinery for settling rents on a fair basis.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

(iv) Carry out a new programme of modernisation of old houses. If landlords
fail to bring their houses up to the new standards required, then such houses
will be purchased by the local authority with an option to buy to those sitting
tenants who wish to become owner-occupiers.

(v) Accelerate slum clearance and concentrate aid and resources more
heavily on those authorities with the biggest housing problems.

(vi) Change leasehold law to enable householders with an original lease of
more than 21 years to buy their own houses on fair terms.

Labour will also increase the building of new houses, both for rent and for
sale. While we regard 400,000 houses as a reasonable target, we do not
intend to have an election auction on housing figures. It is no good having
paper plans for houses if - as the present Minister of Housing is now
discovering - you haven't the bricks to build them.

The crucial factor governing the number of new houses that we can build -
and indeed the schools, hospitals, factories, offices and roads that can be
completed - is the output of the construction and building supply industries.

Here we shall need new machinery to put through a series of long-delayed
reforms designed, above all, to increase the number of men - and particularly
of trained men - in the industry and to secure the more rapid use of the new
techniques of industrialised building.

Social Security

Social security benefits - retirement and widows' pension, sickness and
unemployment pay - have been allowed to fall below minimum levels of
human need. Consequently one in four of National Insurance pensioners are
today depending upon means-tested National Assistance benefits. Labour
will reconstruct our social security system:

(1) Existing National Insurance benefits will be raised and thereafter linked
to average earnings so that as earnings rise so too will benefits.

(ii) For those already retired and for widows, an incomes guarantee will be
introduced. This will lay down a new national minimum benefit. Those
whose incomes fall below the new minimum will receive as of right, and
without recourse to National Assistance, an income supplement.

(iii) A new wage-related scheme covering retirement, sickness and
unemployment will be grafted on to the existing flat rate National Insurance
scheme. The objective is half-pay benefits for the worker on average pay.
Those who are married will get more than half pay, as will the lower paid
worker. Since benefits will be graded, so too will contributions, which will
take the form of a percentage contribution on earnings.

Provision will be made for ""contracting out"" good private schemes along the
lines already laid down in the Government's graded pension scheme. The

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 14 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

relevant conditions will be strengthened in order to enforce provision for
widows of contributors, and for deferred retirement. Steps will be taken to
ensure transferabilitv of all private pension schemes.

(iv) Widows' benefits will be reshaped in a new and more generous way and
for them the earnings rule abolished. The ""ten shilling widow"" will have her
pension restored to its original purchasing value.

(v) Anew national severance pay scheme will be introduced. In a period of
rapid industrial change it is o nly elementary justice to compensate
employees who, through no fault of their own, find that their job has
disappeared. Directors and senior executives have long received a ""golden
handshake"": the same principle of compensation for job loss will now be
applied to the whole work force.

Labour recognises that the nation cannot have first-rate social security on the
cheap. That is why we insist that the new wage-related benefits must be self-
supporting and must be financed, in the main by graded contributions from
employers and employees. For the same reason we stress again that, with the
exception of the early introduction of the income guarantee, the key factor in
determining the speed at which new and better levels of benefit can be
introduced, will be the rate at which the British economy can advance.

Health

The National Health Service was among the foremost achievements of the
1945-50 Labour Government. Since then it has been starved of resources
and has failed to adapt sufficiently to modern needs. Serious shortages of
hospital staff mean long delays in obtaining treatment, with waiting lists of
nearly 500,000. Shortages of general practitioners mean long waits in
overcrowded surgeries. Local services for the handicapped and the elderly
are severely handicapped by lack of staff. Every part of the hospital service
is impaired by outdated premises. As a result of this neglect the patient has
suffered - in spite of the efforts of medical staffs. Labour will put the patient
first.

(i) The most serious attack on the Health Service made by Conservative
Ministers bas been the increasing burden of prescription charges imposed by
them on those least able to pay. These charges will be abolished. Labour
emphatically rejects recent proposals to introduce new charges for general
practitioner services; our aim is to restore as rapidly as possible a completely
free Health Service.

(ii) Labour will press ahead with a revised hospital plan. Nearly 20 years
after the war the nation ought to have built far more than five general
hospitals. The Tories' so-called ""plan"" is largely based on guesswork. It
seriously underestimates the demand for beds in certain areas and for certain
categories of need such as mental illness and old people's beds. And already
this inadequate plan is being bogged down for lack of funds.

Labour will review the whole plan on the basis of a full assessment of local

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 13:12

Page 15 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

needs and provide the necessary finance to carry the plan through. In
particular the plan must ensure that every women who wishes to, or needs to,
have her baby in hospital shall be able to do so. We shall take steps to
combat queue jumping for hospital beds.

(iii) Labour will greatly increase the number of qualified medical staff. We
shall train more doctors and dentists both by increasing the number of
students admitted to existing medical schools and by establishing new
medical schools. We shall tackle the serious shortages of nurses,
radiographers, dieticians and other ancillary staffs by recasting, in
consultation with the unions concerned, the salary structure and the
negotiating machinery.

(iv) We shall devote more resources to medical research.

(v) The community care services run by the local authorities the most
neglected of all the health services in recent years will be given a new
impetus.

Labour will: (a) Expand the home help and other domiciliary services which
are so vital to the well-being of the old and sick; (b) Lay down proper
standards for these services and recast the so-called ten-year health and
welfare plan on this basis; (c) Provide high percentage grants where
emergency action is required to bring a particular service up to standard, e.g.
hostels for the mentally ill.

Leisure Services

Automation, new sources of energy and the growing use of the electronic
calculating machine are beginning to transform almost all branches of our
economic and social life. As these trends develop, the importance of leisure
will steadily increase. It is not the job of the Government to tell people how
leisure should be used. But, in a society where so many facilities are not
provided because they are not profitable and where the trend towards
monopoly, particularly in entertainment, is steadily growing, the
Government has a duty to ensure that leisure facilities are provided and that
a reasonable range of choice is maintained.

A Labour Government would therefore:

(i) End the present parsimony in the supply of public funds for out-door
recreation:

develop the national parks: preserve access to the coast and protect it from
pollution and unplanned development: set up a sports council to supply in
consultation with local authorities and voluntary bodies the physical

equipment, coaching facilities and playing fields that are so badly needed.

(ii) The Youth Service will be developed with grants for youth centres,

swimming pools, coffee bars and other facilities without which the present
service cannot function.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

(iii) Give much more generous support to the Arts Council, the theatre,
orchestras, concert halls, museums and art galleries.

(iv) Encourage and support independent film makers both for the cinema and
television.

A New Role for Britain

It is not only in the domestic field that the Conservatives have failed the
nation. During these 13 years of Conservative power British statesmanship
has been tested by three great challenges - the end of the colonial era,
thawing of the cold war and the new military role for Britain which these
developments require. In each case the Conservatives have shown their
inability to keep pace with the dramatic changes in the world scene. They
have lost any sense of vision of Britain's role in the second half of the 20th
century.

Through their bankrupt and vacillating leadership the Tory Government have
bequeathed to Labour a Britain dragging its feet, side-stepping the
challenging issues of our time, forced to linger temporarily in the wings of
history.

A. The End of Colonialism

When World War II unleashed the demand throughout Asia and Africa for
the end of colonialism, Britain's first response was an act of creative
statesmanship. The Labour Government, headed by Clem Attlee, granted
full and complete independence to India, Pakistan, and Ceylon, and thereby
began the process of transforming a white colonial empire into a multi-racial
commonwealth. No nobler transformation is recorded in the story of the
human race.

So long as they were in Opposition, the Conservatives denounced this policy
as socialist scuttle. Faced with responsibility, however, in 1951 they were
compelled very largely to accept it. But the leadership they should have
given was vitiated by the Suez fiasco and the equivocal attitude to African
demands for independence, and the promises which they made-and have
been forced to break - to the settlers.

How little they were able to transfer their faith and enthusiasm from the old
Empire to the new Commonwealth was shown when Harold Macmillan and
Alec Douglas-Home both declared there was no future for Britain outside
the Common Market and expressed themselves ready to accept terms of
entry to the Common Market that would have excluded our Commonwealth
partners, broken our special trade links with them, and forced us to treat
them as third-class nations.

Though we shall seek to achieve closer links with our European neighbours,
the Labour Party is convinced that the first responsibility of a British
Government is still to the Commonwealth.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12
Commonwealth Immigration

As the centre of a great Commonwealth of 700 million people, linked to us
by ties of history and common interest, Britain faces the three great
problems of poverty, rapidly rising population, and racial conflict.

By herself Britain cannot, of course, solve these problems; but more than
any other advanced country of the west, we have the greatest opportunity
and the greatest incentive to tackle them. We believe that the
Commonwealth has a major part to play in grappling with the terrible
inequalities that separate the developed and under developed nations and the
white and coloured races.

That is why a Labour Government will legislate against racial discrimination
and incitement in public places and give special help to local authorities in
areas where immigrants have settled. Labour accepts that the number of
immigrants entering the United Kingdom must be limited. Until a
satisfactory agreement covering this can be negotiated with the
Commonwealth a Labour Government will retain immigration control.

Commonwealth Trade

Under the Tories the Commonwealth share of our trade has been allowed to
fall from 44 per cent. to 30 per cent. and the defeatist view that it will
decline still further has gained ground.

Worse still, the Commonwealth itself came near to disintegration at the time
of the Common Market negotiations. The recent Commonwealth conference
showed its sturdy resilience, but what is lacking is any coherent policy at the
centre. We shall:

(i) Promote more effective and frequent consultations between
Commonwealth leaders, for example by the establishment of a
Commonwealth Consultative Assembly.

(ii) Make a new drive for exports through a Commonwealth exports council.

(iii) Build a firmer base for expanding trade by entering into long-term
contracts and commodity agreements providing guaranteed markets for
Commonwealth primary produce at stable prices.

(iv) Ensure that development and capital investment programmes are geared
to Commonwealth needs.

(v) Promote wider educational, cultural, scientific and technical contracts, a
more imaginative system of links between British communities and towns
and villages in the Commonwealth, and more opportunities for overseas
voluntary service.

(vi) Encourage joint Commonwealth activity on developments required
throughout the Commonwealth, such as a communications satellite and

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 18 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

passenger aircraft designed for Commonwealth routes.

(vii) Work towards the creation of a pensionable career service for experts
working in the Commonwealth.

The New War - On Want

But the problem presented by the colonial uprising is not limited to the
Commonwealth. Poverty is an ever-present fear for more than half the
world's population. It presents the western industrialised nations with a
tremendous challenge which we ignore at our peril: for there is a growing
danger that the increasing tensions caused by gross inequalities of
circumstances between the rich and poor nations will be sharply accentuated
by differences of race and colour.

We believe that the socialist axiom ""From each according to his ability, to
each according to his need"" is not for home consumption only. Labour will:

(i) Discuss with other countries proposals for expanding the trade of
developing nations.

(ii) Increase the share of our national income devoted to essential aid
programmes, not only by loans and grants but by mobilising unused
industrial capacity to meet overseas needs.

(iii) Revive the concept of a world food board for the disposal of agricultural
surpluses.

To give a dynamic lead in this vital field, Labour will create a Ministry of
Overseas Development to be responsible not only for our part in
Commonwealth development but also for our work in and through the
specialist agencies of the United Nations. This new Ministry will help and
encourage voluntary action through those organisations that have played
such an inspired part in the Freedom from Hunger campaign. We must
match their enterprise with Government action to give new hope in the
current United Nations Development Decade.

B. New Prospects for Peace

The second great opportunity for British statesmanship arose as a result of
the changes in the communist world that followed Stalin's death - changes
which are gradually transforming the relations between the Soviet Union,
Eastern Europe and China and rapidly changing the whole nature of East-
West relationships. In 1945, it was the hope of the whole world that east-
west co-operation would prove close enough to permit the United Nations to
be transformed step by step into a world government.

When these hopes were blighted by Stalin's brutal intransigence, it was
Labour's Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, who took the lead in facing the
harsh realities of the cold war, and in creating the Nato alliance as the basis
of Europe's military security. But even during the grimmest periods of the

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 19 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

Berlin airlift and the Korean War, Labour always regarded the cold war
strategies as a second best, forced on us by Russia's obstinacy and remained
faithful to its long-term belief in the establishment of east-west co-operation
as the basis for a strengthened United Nations developing towards world
government.

The attitude of the Conservatives after 1951 was very different. Viewing the
world only in terms of old-fashioned power politics, resentful of the loss of
empire, and the increasing influence of the new nations, they have been
mainly concerned to build up a so-called independent British nuclear power
in the vain belief that this would restore our influence in world affairs.
Instead of throwing Britain's full weight into efforts to relax tensions and to
halt the spread of nuclear weapons the Tories were content to play a minor
and subordinate role leaving the initiative to others.

Moreover their isolationist nuclear policy has been a direct incitement to
other nations to attain nuclear status. All the arguments the Tories have used
for Britain have been repeated in France and find dangerous echoes in
Germany. The spread of nuclear weapons cannot lead to disarmament or to
the thawing of the cold war, only to a proliferation of nuclear arms and the
heightening of tensions between East and West.

Relaxing Tensions

A Labour Government will do everything possible to halt this dangerous
trend, and to resolve the differences at present dividing east and west.

First and foremost will come our initiative in the field of disarmament. We
are convinced that the time is opportune for a new break-through in the
disarmament negotiations, releasing scarce resources and manpower
desperately needed to raise living standards throughout the world.

We shall appoint a Minister in the Foreign Office with special responsibility
for disarmament to take a new initiative in the Disarmament Committee in
association with our friends and allies. We have put forward constructive
proposals:

(i) To stop the spread of nuclear weapons.

(ii) To establish nuclear free zones in Africa, Latin America and Central
Europe.

(111) To achieve controlled reductions in manpower and arms.
(iv) To stop the private sale of arms.

(v) To establish an international disarmament agency to supervise a
disarmament treaty.

In a further effort to relax tension, a Labour Government will work actively
to bring Communist China into its proper place in the United Nations: as

http://labourmanifesto.com/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 20 of 24

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

well as making an all-out effort to develop east-west trade as the soundest
economic basis for peaceful co-existence.

Peaceful co-existence, however, can only be achieved if a sincere readiness
to negotiate is combined with a firm determination to resist both threats and
pressures. In particular in dealing with the still intractable problems dividing
Germany, we shall continue to insist on guarantees for the freedom of west
Berlin.

A New Lead at the United Nations

But our most important effort will be concerned to revive the morale and
increase the powers of the United Nations. Every year that has passed since
the Conservatives came to power has seen Britain's influence in the United
Nations decline. At home the Prime Minister and others have voiced their
nagging criticisms while in the General Assembly, time and time again
Britain is to be found among the ranks of the abstentionists on vital issues of
freedom and racial equality.

This has reflected itself in the Government's equivocal attitude to racial
problems in South Africa. Labour will stand by its pledge to end the supply
of arms to South Africa. Britain, of all nations, cannot stand by as an
inactive observer of this tragic situation.

Labour will reassert British influence in the United Nations. We will seek to
strengthen the U.N. by developing its machinery for international
conciliation, by making an effective contribution to the creation of an
international police force, and by reforming the Security Council and the
Economic and Social Council so that they are more representative of the
new nations. We believe that the United Nations provides the natural venue
for more frequent summit meetings.

For us world government is the final objective - and the United Nations the
chosen instrument by which the world can move away from the anarchy of
power politics towards the creation of a genuine world community and the
tule of law.

C. Defence Policy

The Labour Party will ensure that Britain is adequately defended. This is
manifestly not the position today.

In 13 years, the Conservatives have spent £20,000 m. and our defences are
weaker than at almost any time in our history. Flagrant waste on missile and
other projects has diverted funds and resources from urgently needed
defence projects. This is one reason for their failure to obtain on a voluntary,
regular basis the required numbers in the Army, to modernise their
obsolescent equipment and to give them the long-range mobility needed for
our commitments, particularly to the Commonwealth.

Mr. Macmillan's decision in 1957 to stake his all on Blue Streak, followed
by further costly expenditure on Skybolt and now Polaris, has meant that the
Navy too has been run down to a dangerously low level, and is now
pathetically inadequate in numbers of ships in commission, in manning and
in the most modern types such as nuclear-powered tracker submarines.

Many thousands of millions have been spent on the aircraft industry, but
because of lurches in strategic policy, wrong priorities, and grave errors in
the choice of aircraft, we are now in a position where obsolete types have
not been replaced, and for such urgently needed machines as helicopters
(which could make a great contribution to the security and effectiveness of
our troops in Malaysia) we are dependent on the United States.

Tory Nuclear Pretence

The Nassau agreement to buy Polaris know-how and Polaris missiles from
the U.S.A. will add nothing to the deterrent strength of the western alliance,
and it will mean utter dependence on the U.S. for their supply. Nor is it true
that all this costly defence expenditure will produce an ""independent British
deterrent"". It will not be independent and it will not be British and it will not
deter. Its possession will impress neither friend nor potential foe.

Moreover, Britain's insistence on this nuclear pretence carries with it grave
dangers of encouraging the spread of nuclear weapons to countries not
possessing them, including Germany.

The Government bases its policy on the assumption that Britain must be
prepared to go it alone without her allies in an all-out thermo-nuclear war
with the Soviet Union, involving the obliteration of our people. By
constantly reiterating this appalling assumption the Government is
undermining the alliance on which our security now depends.

Labour's New Approach

A Labour Government's first concern will be to put our defences on a sound
basis and to ensure that the nation gets value for money on its overseas
expenditure. In this field, any government has a clear responsibility to ensure
the security of its own people and the fulfilment of its obligations to other
nations. As a first step, we shall submit the whole area of weapons supply to
a searching re-examination in order to ensure that the limited sums available
are spent on those weapons best designed to carry out our policies and fulfil
our obligations.

We are not prepared any longer to waste the country's resources on endless
duplication of strategic nuclear weapons. We shall propose the re-negotiation
of the Nassau agreement. Our stress will be on the strengthening of our
conventional regular forces so that we can contribute our share to Nato
defence and also fulfil our peacekeeping commitments to the
Commonwealth and the United Nations.

1964 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

We are against the development of national nuclear deterrents and oppose
the current American proposal for a new mixed-manned nuclear surface fleet
(MLF). We believe in the inter-dependence of the western alliance and will
put forward constructive proposals for integrating all Nato's nuclear weapons
under effective political control so that all the partners in the alliance have a
proper share in their deployment and control.

We do not delude ourselves that the tasks ahead will be easy to accomplish.
Even now we do not know the full extent of the damage we shall have to
repair after 13 wasted years of Conservative government. The essential
conditions for success are, however, clear.

First, we shall need to make government itself more efficient. As the tasks of
government grow more numerous and more complex, the machinery of
government must be modernised. New techniques, new kinds of skill and
experience are needed if government is to govern effectively. Certainly we
shall not permit effective action to be frustrated by the hereditary and non-
elective Conservative majority in the House of Lords.

At the same time new ways must be found to ensure that the growth of
government activity does not infringe the liberties of the subject. This is why
we attach so much importance to humanising the whole administration of the
state and that is why we shall set up the new office of Parliamentary
Commissioner with the right to investigate the grievances of the citizen and
report to a select committee of the House.

Second, we shall seek to establish a true partnership between the people and
their parliament. The government itself cannot create a new Britain. National
regeneration must mean the release of energy in the whole people in the
regions no less than in the capital, so that the drive towards renewal comes
from the vitality and self-confidence of the community itself.

Third, we must foster, throughout the nation, a new and more critical spirit.
In place of the cosy complacency of the past 13 years, we shall seek to
evoke an active and searching frame of mind in which all of us, individuals,
enterprises and trade unions are ready to re-examine our methods of work, to
innovate and to modernise. Here too, the Government can give a lead by
subjecting to continuing and probing review the practices of its own
Departments of State, the administration of justice and the social services,
the Statute Book with its encrusted laws - and the work of Parliament itself.

Fourth, we must put an end to the dreary commercialism and personal
selfishness which have dominated the years of Conservative government.
The morality of money and property is a dead and deadening morality. In its
place we must again reassert the value of service above private profit and
private gain.

The Labour Party is offering Britain a new way of life that will stir our
hearts, re-kindle an authentic patriotic faith in our future, and enable our
country to re-establish itself as a stable force in the world today for progress,
peace, and justice.

1966 Labour Party Election
Manifesto

 

Time for Decision

Preface: Time for Decision

The time has come when the Government must ask the British people to
renew and strengthen its mandate. Since we came to power in October, 1964,
the nation has had firm government. But without an effective working
majority it is difficult - and would become increasingly so - for the
Government to continue to exercise influence in the outside world, and to
exert its full authority in Whitehall, Westminster and the councils of
industry.

Since the collapse of the Macmillan Government three years ago, the
authority of successive governments had been eroded by an atmosphere of
fevered electoral uncertainty.

The remedy lies in the hands of the electors. The time for decision has
come.

The course the Government recommends to the nation is clear. We are
asking for a mandate to carry through the radical reconstruction of our
national life which we began eighteen months ago. The road of renewal had
been mapped in our election manifesto of 1964. Since we took office we
have started on the long process of modernising obsolete procedures and
institutions, ending the dominance of vested interests, liberating the forces of
youth and building a New Britain.

The task we have started, however, cannot be completed by Government
acting alone. Its fulfilment will only be possible if the British people
understand what the Government is doing, and give us their active support in
finishing the job. It is for this active support, represented by a clear
Parliamentary majority, that we now ask.

Part 1: Facing the Facts

During the past 18 months, Britain has faced, fought and overcome its
toughest crisis since the War. More, it has in the teeth of adversity fashioned
the new instruments of policy with which, under the guidance of the
National Plan, a new and better Britain can be built.

In this Statement we first make a progress report to the nation. Then we
show what next must be done to turn the breathing space won in 1965 into a
period of permanent strength and security.

Whatever the future may bring, there can be no turning back to the tired and
discredited policies of the long Conservative era. The period of drift and
indecision in Government, of backward looking complacency in industry
and commerce, of reliance upon individual and group selfishness as the main
motive for change - all this is over.

1. Britain in Crisis

No one can deny the magnitude of the crisis the Labour Government
inherited in 1964.

With a record - and almost incredible - deficit of over £750 million already
incurred; with a rising flood of foreign goods; with the pound sterling
imperilled; with prices soaring; with wages and salaries following hard
behind - the nation in October, 1964, was plunging towards economic
disaster and financial collapse.

Not only did the Tories fail to take preventive measures; throughout the
previous year they were busily feeding the pre-Election boom. By Initiating
a spate of vote-catching schemes, they had encouraged a massive expansion
of private and public expenditure without regard for the consequences that
would follow after the Election.

But acute as they were, the dangers we faced in October, 1964, were only
symptoms of a more fundamental crisis:

1. Successive Tory Governments had failed to rethink Britain's role in
the modem world. They failed to identify the new problems of the
Sixties and realistically appraise national resources. Instead they
pursued, from motives of prestige and nostalgia, foreign, military and
financial policies which were increasingly irrelevant and increasingly
expensive - policies which sapped our economic strength, depleted our
reserves and overstrained our resources.

2. At home there was an equally disastrous failure to tackle the
fundamental problems of the British economy: instead of ensuring
steady economic growth, a strong balance of payments, the rapid
modernisation of our industries and a proper balance between public
and private expenditure, the economy was left to the push and pull of
the market - as though we were still living in an era of laissez faire.

Consequently, for more than a decade, we suffered the disastrous cycle
of Stop-Go; inadequate investment in manufacturing industry; the
scandalous neglect of such essential community services as houses,
schools and hospitals.

3. Throughout our national life there was a stubborn refusal to root out
obsolete ideas and modernise obsolescent institutions. Instead of
setting an example to the timid and old-fashioned in industry and

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

commerce, Tory Governments funked the radical reorganisation of the
whole machinery of the state - local as well as national - which was so
desperately required.

4. Finally - and perhaps most serious - easy-going drift, backward-
looking incompetence and an acceptance of national decline were
accompanied by the erosion of fairness and social justice, by a
growing neglect of community responsibility for the old, the sick and
the needy - and by an incitement to speculation and the pursuit of
sectional advantage.

2. Forward from Crisis

The Labour Government had to take unpopular decisions - and took them
regardless of temporary unpopularity. Imports were cut and taxes raised. The
TSR2 and other prestige projects were cancelled; firm limits were placed on
military and civil expenditure. But in the pursuit of solvency and the
defence of the pound, which were our overriding aims, the new
Government was determined not to repeat Conservative Stop-Go.

Whatever the pressures, it would not jettison the four central objectives of its
policy:

1. To ensure that even in times of economic crisis those in need should
be helped by the state. Even in the first crucial six months of office,
retirement and widows' pensions, sickness and unemployment
benefits, war and industrial disability pensions were all increased by
the greatest amount ever. Prescription charges were abolished and an
interim measure was rushed through to stop evictions, unleashed by
the Tory Rent Act.

2. To establish a clear system of priorities in public expenditure. While
inflated public expenditure generally was cut back, housing, schools
and hospitals were specially exempted, as were the regions of high
unemployment.

3. To maintain full employment and a high level of investment in
productive industry, while damping down the overheated economy.

4. To get on with the longer term reconstruction of Britain, with a
National Plan and a range of new economic, fiscal and social policies
to carry it through.

Inevitably it took time to forge the new instruments of policy, such as control
over building and the movement of capital abroad, without which national
planning is an empty phrase.

Nevertheless, the achievement in 500 days has been immense. The deficit on
our overseas payments has been cut from over £750 million to around £350
million. Overseas confidence in sterling has grown steadily as the world has
become convinced that we are winning the battle for solvency.

The victory was a real one; but so was the price the nation paid. In particular
the high interest rates required to strengthen sterling forced up mortgage

payments and council house rents. But one price the nation did not have to

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

pay - the deliberate creation of unemployment which our predecessors
regarded as inevitable. In this crisis year we raised the level of employment;
we built a record number of houses; we achieved record figures for
investment in new schools and hospitals. Most important to the future, the
deficit was halved; exports rose sharply and industrial investment reached an
all-time high.

In the past, our predecessors had reacted to overseas deficits by imposing a
total Stop. Faced with the far greater crisis they left us in 1964/65, we
stopped the inessential, we postponed the less essential and we went
right ahead with our priorities.

3. Telling the People

Britain has weathered the storm. But full solvency has yet to be achieved.
The debts incurred as a direct consequence of Tory policy will have to be
repaid. The reshaping of British industry and the economy have only just
begun.

There is no easy road ahead - and only the dishonest would pretend that
there is. But we do not believe that the British people want to be lulled with
the message that ""all is well"" and that they have ""never had it so good."" Nor
do we think that they expected or wanted their Government to present a
give-away Budget on the eve of a General Election. We have not done so.
And we shall take whatever further steps are necessary even if they are
unpopular, in order to achieve the rate of progress that we need.

We are facing the facts - as they should have been faced in the 13 years of
Tory rule.

Part 2: A Strong Economy

During the next five years we intend to carry through a massive programme
for modernising and strengthening British industry. That is the prime
purpose of the National Plan.

We have regulated demand through selective measures with no return to
Stop-Go. Now that our new techniques - such as investment grants, licensing
of inessential building and the Industrial Re-organisation Corporation - are
coming into use, we shall increasingly be able to apply social priorities,
giving preference to industrial investment and to a better regional balance.

While implementation of the policy depends on the initiative and ingenuity

of industry and commerce, the Government too has its responsibilities
abroad as well as at home:

1. Paying our Way

It is our aim to achieve balance in our international payments by the end of

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

this year. To do this, a persistent national effort will be required.

1. 1. Exports. Last year, exports rose by 5 per cent in volume, and by 7
per cent in value. Further progress will be made as the new incentives
to exporters - the export rebate scheme, better credit facilities and the
favourable interest rates - take effect.

2. Imports. The disastrous increase in imports was checked by the
temporary surcharge we imposed in 1964. Intense efforts are now
being made to replace those imported products which British industry
can produce competitively.

3. Overseas Military Expenditure. This is being cut back by such
measures as the Anglo-German agreement on B.A.O.R. support costs
and the decision to withdraw from Aden and to reduce establishments
in Cyprus and Malta. But we shall still be carrying a heavy burden in
maintaining commitments abroad as our contribution to peace-keeping
in different areas of the world. The 1966 Defence Review is only the
first step in a phased programme which should bring substantial cuts
both in commitments and in expenditure by 1969-70.

4. Drain of Capital. The uncontrolled flow of British capital abroad has
been an excessive burden on an already weak balance of payments. By
amending the taxation of overseas income and by selective control
over the export of capital, we have staunched this loss of resources.

There can be no relaxing here at least until we again earn a current surplus.
2. Increasing Productivity

The National Plan, published last September, defined the objectives of the
British economy between now and 1970 and then outlined the strategy
required to achieve them. Our central aim must be to accelerate industrial
expansion without undermining our social priorities.

i. Selective Investment

British industry's most compelling need is not just more investment but
more selective investment. The National Plan in itself helps by giving
industrialists a clear picture of national priorities. We are now introducing
three new economic weapons to further this policy:

First, the effect of the Corporation Tax will be to reduce taxation of profits,
provided they are ploughed back, not distributed as dividends.

Second, the new system of investment incentives will provide direct cash
grants to expanding firms. These will differentiate sharply in favour of
manufacturing industries, upon which the competitive strength of the
economy depends.

Third, the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation will stimulate

rationalisation, modernisation and expansion in those fields where British
industry at present seems unable to compete with the giant firms of the U.S.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12
and Europe.
ii. Productivity, Prices and Incomes

In order to safeguard the real value of wages, the Labour Government
launched the first serious attack on the rising cost of living. The weapon
specially fashioned for this attack is the policy for productivity, prices and
incomes, which forms an essential part of the National Plan. Without such a
policy it is impossible either to keep exports competitive or to check rising
prices at home. The alternative, in fact, is a return to the dreary cycle of
inflation followed by deflation and unemployment.

Substantial progress has been made in working out, with management and
the unions, the objectives and criteria of such a policy. An essential part of
the machinery, the Prices and Incomes Board, is now operating. But the
policy needs further development.

First, we intend to give a new stress to productivity, and we will attack
restrictive practices wherever they exist. A National Conference
representative of industry will be called under the Chairmanship of the
Prime Minister to discuss all matters relating to productivity, including the
extension throughout industry of Pay and Productivity Councils,
representing management and employees. This will form part of an effort to
stimulate industrial democracy.

Second, we shall reconstitute the Prices and Incomes Board and seek such
developments in the early warning system as are necessary for the Board to
do its job properly. Our purpose is not to dictate prices, wages and salaries -
but to give, in selected cases, the opportunity for objective consideration of
claims before either prices are fixed or collective bargains struck.

Third, we shall make sure that the policy is not only fair but seen to be fair.
In our pursuit of a planned growth of incomes the needs of the lower-paid
worker will not be ignored.

iii. Regional Economic Planning

Effective Regional Planning is needed:

¢ (a) to assist the areas of chronic unemployment, and so bring into
production the remaining untapped sources of labour; and

¢ (b) to stop the drift of work and population to the West Midlands and
the South East where congestion adds enormously to business and
social costs.

Vigorous action has already been taken in this field. We have used our new
office and building controls to relieve congestion in London and
Birmingham. We have extended the development areas and guided industry
there. We have helped firms ready to set up business in development regions
through massive special investment grants. We have further discriminated in

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

favour of these areas by totally exempting them from the cuts imposed last
summer on national and local government expenditure.

Industrial Development Certificates are helping to bring new building to the
under-employed regions - and reducing it in the congested South East. As a
result, employment has grown markedly in these regions.

These, however, are only the first emergency steps towards the development
of full-scale regional economic planning, for which the Regional Councils
and the Regional Boards have been established.

Scotland and Wales

Labour respects the differences of culture and tradition of Scotland and
Wales; nevertheless, we see the economic well-being of Great Britain as
indivisible. The Government has therefore set out measures which help both
Scotland and Wales, within the context of a true National Plan.

New life has been brought to the Highlands and Islands, and a major Plan
prepared for economic and social expansion in Scotland. The task now is to
achieve its targets, and keep up the record progress made in 1965.

For the first time there is a Secretary of State for Wales in the Cabinet. The
Welsh office is already making an impact on employment, industrial
development and opportunities for young people in Wales. The Welsh
Economic Development Council is now working out genuinely Welsh
solutions to the problems of the rural areas.

3. Helping Industry

Some of our industries present special problems, too serious to be over come
from their own resources. In such cases the Government must be ready to
help. To this end, we propose, apart from vigorous action by the Industrial
Reorganisation Corporation:

¢ to continue and develop policies introduced by the new Ministry of
Technology for providing purposive financial assistance to key
industries such as computers and machine tools.

¢ to use the various publicly financed research councils and the enlarged
N.R.D.C. to sponsor and develop new science-based industries.

¢ to transfer the private steel monopoly into public ownership and to
rationalise its structure.

¢ to rationalise the aircraft industry on the basis of public participation,
taking into account the recent Plowden Report.

Private and Public Enterprise

Britain has a mixed economy - and both sectors must play their part in
carrying out the National Plan. Both sectors, however, must be encouraged
to become more enterprising.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

In the private sector, we have already proposed major reforms of Company
Law, the purpose of which will be to stimulate, through much greater
disclosure of their affairs, improved managerial practices and a better use of
their resources. Companies will also be required to publish details of their
political subscriptions.

We shall encourage go-ahead firms by changes in the tax laws and, by
securing a larger say in the affairs of companies for full-time working
directors, encourage technical expertise, knowledge and Initiative.

In the public sector, we shall remove statutory restrictions from publicly
owned industries and so encourage greater diversification of their activities.
In a rapidly changing economy it is simply absurd to limit by statute these
large enterprises to a single sphere of activity.

The great fuel and power industries occupy a major part of the public sector.

Here, the Government has laid the basis for a national fuel policy, and gone a

long way towards reconstruction of the coal industry's finances by writing
off £415 million of the National Coal Board's capital debt. Further financial
measures will help concentrate production on the most economic pits, and
provide up to £30 million to encourage labour mobility.

The best available estimate of the market for coal in 1970 is 170-180 million
tons. We stress that this is an estimate, and in no sense a limitation.
Everything depends upon efficiency, costs and the resulting prices. If more
can be profitably sold, then no barrier will stand in the way of expansion.

We shall further develop co-operation between nationalised industries to cut
out waste; we shall set out more precise targets to guide their investment and
price policy in the national interest.

4. Agriculture

The selective expansion of agricultural production is a key part of the
National Plan. In particular, it will make a significant contribution to the
balance of payments by import saving.

The record of our farmers and farm workers in increasing productivity
is outstanding. We shall not shake their confidence by substituting for
the well-tried deficiency payments the levies on imported foodstuffs
advocated by the Conservatives. This would reduce the farmers'
security and push up food prices to new high levels.

The cost to the Exchequer of agricultural support can much better be
contained by measures designed to enable the industry to achieve still higher
productivity and a higher return on its capital. To this end we have presented
a scheme to promote agricultural and horticultural co-operation and develop
the resources of the hills and uplands.

We shall continue to improve the conditions of the farm worker, and see
that he gets his full share of rising prosperity.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 13:12

Page 8 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

We shall also expand agricultural research, making the results more widely
available. Most important of all, we shall Initiate the radical reform required
to achieve cheaper marketing of foodstuffs by reducing the gap between
what the producer receives and what the consumer pays.

To maintain price stability and orderly marketing, imports of foodstuffs must
be integrated with home supplies. Since these imports form so high a
proportion of all our imports, and have a profound effect on our balance of
payments, our price levels and the stability of our home industry, the
Government must retain responsibility for integration.

We shall do our utmost to conclude international commodity arrangements
with a view to promoting stability. As the circumstances of each commodity
differ, each will have to be treated on its merits.

5. The Standard of Living

In the next five years living standards for the individual and for the whole
community will rise by 25 per cent, as we increase our production of goods
and services.

However, unless we can check the rising cost of living many groups,
particularly those on fixed incomes, will find their living standards
undermined - as they were persistently under the Tories. The prices and
incomes policy is our main response to this problem. But other policies are
also relevant. Labour's rent control, for example, has secured hundreds of
thousands of tenants against rising rents.

In particular, we shall further reduce inflated costs and profit margins in
production and distribution by waging a vigorous anti-monopoly policy in
fields where market powers are abused. We have already referred a number
of cases to the strengthened Monopolies Commission.

We shall also enforce quality standards and protect the consumer from sharp
trading practices. Under Labour's Protection of Consumer Bill, false
advertising, misleading labelling of goods, deceptive prices (the ""4d.-off
racket"") and oral mis-statements by doorstep salesmen, are banned.

This ""Shoppers' Charter"" will be administered by Local Authorities, whose
Weights and Measures Officers will be able quickly to deal with customers'
complaints of unfair trading.

Part 3: Building a New Britain

The Britain we want has yet to be built. Many of our cities and towns are
bursting at the seams with growing populations. Those spawned by the
industrial revolution grew without vision or plan. They are utterly
inadequate to the needs of today. But whether planned or unplanned, all our
towns are choked with traffic, and their population overspill threatens the
unspoiled countryside around.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

Within them, essential services are in short supply and in urgent need of
renewal. Not only houses and roads, but hospitals, schools, universities,
offices, civic buildings, facilities for leisure and recreation - even water and
sewerage - are strained to breaking point.

At the same time our network of communications - passenger and freight,
road, rail and canal, ports and airfields - is increasingly inadequate and
chaotic.

In their pre-election boom the Conservatives gave the impression that
money, resources and skilled labour were available to meet any and all of
these demands simultaneously. It is now plain that the grandiose plans they
announced were uncosted and mutually inconsistent. The industries
concerned - building and civil engineering - cannot expand without limit
when other demands of the economy are taken into account. Although their
efficiency is being improved and their output increased, demands will
outstrip resources for years ahead and there will be a constant shortage of
skilled labour.

Moreover, the resources available are strictly limited. That is why, in this
crucial field of physical reconstruction, priorities must be clearly defined and
strongly enforced.

1. Housing

Our first priority is houses. Last year, for the first time in a period of general
economic restraint, the housing programme not only did not suffer but
actually expanded.

e In 1963, the nation built 300,000 houses.

¢ In 1964, as part of the Tory pre-election boom, the figure reached
374,000 - and greatly strained the building supply industry.

¢ In 1965, we not only overcame the shortages but increased the total to
383,000 houses.

In the next five years we shall go further. We have announced - and we
intend to achieve - a Government target of 500,000 houses by 1969/70. After
that we shall go on to higher levels still. It can be done - as other nations
have shown. It must be done - for bad and inadequate housing is the greatest
social evil in Britain today.

i. Controls

To achieve our target, we need powers to stop less essential building. Office
building is now controlled by law, and a strict control of all local authority
building is exercised by the Ministers concerned. In this way resources and

labour are being made available for the increased housing programme.

ii. Land

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

We inherited a land famine and rocketing prices, caused by the Tory decision
to return to a free market in land. In the Crown Land Commission we are
fashioning an instrument to secure a sufficiently orderly supply of land, and
bring back to the community a substantial part of the development value
created. This has met bitter opposition from Liberals as well as
Conservatives.

iii. Houses to Let

The desperate shortage of houses to let at moderate rents in our great
conurbations can only be met by a large and speedy increase in council
building. To make this financially possible, we have provided councils with
the equivalent of 4 per cent interest rates for house building. At present
interest rates, the new Subsidy Bill increases the basic subsidy of £24, where
the Tories left it, to well over £60 per house. Part of this very substantial
increase will be used by councils to ensure that every new house is built to
the improved standards laid down by the Government.

In order to combine labour saving and standardisation, which will cut costs,
with the improved quality on which we must insist, we are requiring local
authorities to rely increasingly on modern system building techniques.

iv. Houses to Buy

In order to secure an adequate flow of finance for private housing we have
persuaded the building societies and the builders to work closely with the
Ministry of Housing in planning a steady continuous expansion of output up
to their share of the programme.

In addition to a mortgage plan (see page 17) we are determined to protect the
owner-occupier against the jerry-builder. This can best be achieved if the
building societies and the builders agree that mortgages will only be given
on houses covered by the National House Building Registration Council
certificate. The Government has made it clear, however, that if this voluntary
scheme is not working effectively by the end of the year, legislation will be
used.

2. Cities and Towns

Britain needs a massive programme of urban renewal. Large parts of our
cities are in decay and many of our urban centres are ill-designed and
choked with motor traffic.

Here, however, we need the most careful planning if resources are not to be
wasted. In the past ten years, far too many ill-thought-out plans have been
sanctioned, tearing out at great cost urban centres and renewing them for
essentially commercial purposes. Department stores and office blocks have
made far too heavy demands on the construction industries. A new strategy
of development is required.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

e First, and most Important, we must deal with the problem of the
journey to work: for it is this, particularly in London and the other
great cities, that poses the most intractable problem, presenting our
diminishing public transport fleets with a tidal wave of users and
jamming the roads with private car commuters.

We are convinced that the basic solution to this problem must lie with
improved public transport, supported by sensible parking regulations
and by road building designed to siphon off through- traffic.

We are already reviewing the absurd closure programme of suburban
and urban rail services. We shall maintain public transport services in
our towns and cities and aim at higher levels of comfort and
frequency. We shall also tackle the problems of central redevelopment
and new forms of transport by financing feasibility studies by local
authorities; e.g., a monorail for Manchester.

e Second: we shall make a new approach to the problem of central
areas in our cities. Slum clearance must of course go on. But there
must be quicker and fairer compensation for those displaced.
However, we shall not be content simply to demolish. Wherever
possible, we shall renew and modernise existing buildings. We shall
also ensure that expensive facilities such as swimming pools, playing
fields, assembly halls, are made more widely available to the
community and not reserved only for the particular groups - schools
and colleges - for which they were built.

The better provision of sporting, arts and other leisure facilities is
essential to modern living.

e Third: we shall go ahead with a further programme of New and
Expanded Towns.
It was one of the scandals of the wasted years that from 1951 to 1961
not one New Town was authorised in Britain.

We are now at work on a second generation of much bigger towns to
relieve the strain on London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester.
They will reduce urban pressure by recruiting their citizens mainly
from the housing lists and from council houses. Wherever possible we
are also expanding the established New Towns.

We shall fulfil our promise to bring real democratic self-government to
those which are fully grown, by the abolition of the New Towns
Commission.

3. Transport

Transport planning, both national and regional, is an essential part of
community planning. The Tory attempt to solve our transport problems by
increasing competition between road and rail, by the adoption of rigid
commercial criteria for the railways and other public transport services, and
by deliberate fragmentation of transport undertakings, is the most

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

conspicuous and most costly of all their failures.

Restoring sense and balance to our transport system is now an immensely
difficult job. But it must be undertaken.

Within the framework of a National Transport Plan Labour will:

1. Carry out an expanding road programme speeding up road
construction and cutting costs by new methods of financing highway
development.

2. Co-ordinate road and rail in order to use existing resources to best
effect. As a first step, we shall create a National Freight Authority to
co-ordinate the movement of freight by road and rail, and provide a
first-rate publicly owned service.

3. Legislate to annul the evil effects of the 1962 Tory Transport Act.

4. Encourage the formation of regional and area transport authorities, to
provide more effective public transport in both the conurbations and
tural areas, by integrating road, rail and other forms of transport.

5. In order to speed up the vital flow of exports, reorganise and
modernise the nation's ports on the basis of a strong National Ports
Authority and publicly owned Regional Port Authorities. Within the
ports, we shall end inefficiencies and delays in cargo handling and
help to cure the chaos of the casual system by making each Port
Authority ultimately responsible for all Port operations within its area,
including stevedoring, and by extending the present valuable
experience of joint participation.

6. Remove the statutory restriction on the manufacturing powers of the
publicly owned transport industries.

To safeguard road users, Labour will press ahead with legislation to restrict
drink while driving, to introduce more frequent testing of heavy goods
vehicles and to provide for special driving tests and licences for their drivers.

4. The Countryside

Commons, parks, lakes and coastal areas are of the utmost importance for
recreation and leisure. They must not be spoilt by private development, and
public access must be assured.

The Government has already taken vigorous steps to preserve our coast line,
and safeguard common land.

A new and more powerful Commission to deal with the whole countryside
and coastline is now proposed. Its first aim will be the creation of country
parks, to provide suitable sites for picnics, for leisure pastimes, and for the
motorist.

Long distance walks, access to the open country, the provision of recreation
on canals and rivers - all will form part of this new, imaginative policy from
which millions of our people will benefit, and by which the important
balance between town and country will be maintained.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

We shall strengthen the Forestry Commission; promote landscape planting
of trees; thoroughiy explore the nation's mineral resources. We shall ensure
adequate water supplies by all means, including - where necessary -
extensions of public ownership.

Part 4: The Family in the New Welfare State

At its simplest, our aim is to extend to the whole community what the
responsible citizen wishes for himself and his family:

¢ First and foremost, the opportunity to work and to be fairly rewarded
for it.

¢ Second, to make provision against the day when age, sickness, injury
or redundancy impairs his capacity to earn.

¢ Third, to know that during the misfortunes of ill health, the facilities
of a modern and well equipped service will be available.

¢ Fourth, for his children to receive the best possible standard of
education and training, developing their abilities to the full.

¢ Fifth, to have a home for his family, and to be able to buy or rent it at
reasonable terms.

¢ Sixth, to make a just and reasonable contribution to the costs of the
essential community services which he demands.

1. Full Employment Policies

The level of economic activity in the community must be sufficient to
provide jobs for all Labour has always insisted that this can and will be
ensured through intelligent management of the economy.

The problem today and in the future is not the general unemployment of the
inter-war years but the redundancy that is due both to decline in demand for
the products of an industry and to the development of new labour-saving
methods of production.

Coal, cotton, agriculture and the railways are among those industries in
which, in the postwar years, employment has sharply contracted. Unlike our
predecessors, we have positive policies to meet this problem. We shall:

1. Ensure that new industries, providing new jobs, are available as and
when older industries decline. That is the essential aim of our location
of industry policy.

2. Modernise training and extend retraining, so that new skills are
rapidly acquired. The Government's decision to make day-release a
necessary condition for the new training grants is a major
breakthrough in this field.

3. Ease the transition from one job to another. This is the purpose of
our Redundancy Payments Act, which brings lump sum
compensation, related to service, to those affected by redundancy.

4. Deal with the problem of transferability of occupational pensions.

5. Recognise the right to trade union representation and ensure proper

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 14 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

safeguards against arbitrary dismissal.

6. Supplement voluntary collective bargaining by substantially
increasing the voluntary industrial arbitration and conciliation
machinery, including such successful innovations as the 'on the spot""
investigations instituted by the Labour Government in the motor
industry.

Finally, we must move towards greater fairness in the rewards for work. That
is why we stand for equal pay for equal work and, to this end, have started
negotiations.

We cannot be content with a situation in which important groups -
particularly women, but male workers, too, in some occupations - continue
to be underpaid.

2. Reconstructing Social Security

The postwar Labour Government created the National Insurance scheme
under which flat-rate pensions and other benefits are paid as of right in return
for flat-rate contributions.

But, over the years, this system has become increasingly inadequate, as the
widening gap between actual earnings and National Insurance benefits
makes it impossible to keep up living standards during absence or retirement
from work.

Our plans for a far-reaching reconstruction of social security were well-
advanced when we took office. But first we had to undertake the rescue
operation which we had promised. Within four weeks the Government
introduced legislation to provide the largest single increase in retirement
pensions and other social benefits since the National Insurance scheme
began. The earnings rule for widows was abolished, and prescription charges
removed. With this initial relief provided, we could plan the methods and the
phases of radical reconstruction.

1. Legislation has already been enacted which before the end of this year
will provide earnings-related supplements during the first six months
of sickness, unemployment or widowhood.

2. We shall within the lifetime of the next Parliament prepare and bring
forward a genuine earnings-related, contributory pension scheme to
replace the present Tory swindle. The new graduated scheme will
overcome the problems of transferability of pension rights when an
employee changes his job. There will be partnership between state and
occupational schemes.

3. We shall establish a Ministry of Social Security uniting the Ministry of
Pensions and National Insurance and the National Assistance Board. It
will deal with the whole range of social security questions, and ensure
a rational single system of paying benefits. The Ministry will also
head a drive to seek out, and alleviate, poverty whether among
children or old people.

4. Finally, in the interests of greater equity, we shall seek ways of

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 15 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

integrating more fully the two quite different systems of social
payment - tax allowances and cash benefits paid under National
Insurance.

3. Health and Welfare Services

¢ (i) Hospitals. The review we have undertaken of the much publicised
Conservative Hospital Plan has confirmed our worst suspicions. The
money they allocated was utterly inadequate to carry out the Plan, and
to provide the new and modernised hospitals we so urgently need. Our
aim will be to increase by 1970 the annual spending on hospital
building to a figure double the highest sum spent in any year by the
Conservatives.

Already we have provided substantially more money for the running
of our hospitals, and the rate of development will continue to increase.

¢ (ii) The Family Doctor Service. In the space of a year, the Labour
Government has produced the blueprint of a completely revitalised
family doctor service. We shall ensure that all practical steps are taken
to enable the hard-pressed family doctor to give the best possible
service to his patients with the greatest satisfaction to himself.

Many of the problems in general practice stem from the serious
shortage of doctors, for which successive Tory Ministers bear a heavy
responsibility. We have already made arrangements to increase the
number of medical students by well over 10 per cent a year within the
next couple of years. This is only a first step: a newly established
Royal Commission on Medical Education will help chart future
expansion.

¢ (iii) Community Services. Local health and welfare services,
especially for the elderly and the mentally handicapped, have been
expanding fast. We shall develop these services rapidly, with special
emphasis on those designed to help old people to continue living in
their own homes. For those who can no longer do so, much more
purpose-built accommodation will be provided to replace large
obsolete institutions which can offer neither comfort nor a homely
atmosphere.

* (iv) Preventive Health. Far too little attention has been paid to
preventive health measures in the past. Screening for cervical cancer,
which it is estimated will save the lives of some 2,000 women a year,
is being developed rapidly.

More preventive health campaigns are planned. We shall make a real

forward drive in the neglected field of health education, setting up an
entirely new body, the Health Education Council, for this purpose.

4. Educational Opportunities for All

Our educational aims are two-fold: to give the highest possible standard of
education to all children, and to ensure that those with special abilities have

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

the opportunity to develop them to the full.

These aims have to be achieved against an inheritance of acute teacher
shortage, oversized classes, old and inadequate school buildings, and a
chronically overstrained system of higher education.

Schools

Our first priority is to reduce the size of classes. We shall intensify our
efforts to increase the recruitment of teachers, and improve their status in
society.

We must also make the most effective use of teachers, by encouraging the
use of audio-visual aids and programmed learning; and by providing the
teacher with the ancillary help which he increasingly needs.

We shall carry out the largest school building programme in our history. The
National Plan shows that the programme will be increased from £84 million
in the last year of Tory rule to £138 million in 1969/70.

Equally important, we shall press ahead with our plans to abolish the 11-plus
- that barrier to educational opportunity - and re-organise secondary
education on comprehensive lines. We have appointed the Public Schools
Commission, to recommend the best ways of integrating the Public Schools
into the State sector.

New Deal for the School Leaver

Far too many of our young people still leave school at 15, enter jobs with no
training prospects and break off all contact with education. We plan to
transform this situation by the early 1970s.

The school leaving age will be raised to 16. The new Schools Council is
studying ways of making this extra year at school the greatest success.

Industrial Training Boards will increase the range of training opportunities
for school leavers. They are not just concerned with the traditional craft
skills. They will deal with the office, the shop, and the farm as well as the
factory; with girls as well as boys.

There will be a big increase of day-release and block release courses at local
colleges of further education. It will become normal, rather than exceptional,
for young workers to have part-time education up to the age of at least 18.

There will also be radical improvements in the Youth Employment Service,
and in careers advice at school, in accordance with the Albemarle Report.

Finally, a new Minister is energetically creating, through regional sports
councils, a new approach to the provision of facilities for sport.

Higher Education

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

We shall expand higher education provision in the universities, the colleges
of education, and the leading technical colleges.

The universities are being assisted to make a growing contribution in
science, technology and social studies.

The colleges of education will benefit from our new plans to liberalise their
systems of government, giving more academic freedom. We shall encourage
the growth of arrangements between the colleges and the universities, to
enable more students to take a B.Ed. degree.

In the leading technical colleges we shall rationalise the provision of higher
courses, so that there can be a very large expansion combined with very high
quality.

The Open University

We shall establish the University of the Air. By using TV and radio
communal facilities, high grade correspondence courses and new teaching
techniques, this open University will enormously extend the best teaching
facilities and give everyone the opportunity of study for a full degree.

It will mean genuine equality of opportunity for millions of people for the
first time. Moreover, even for those who prefer not to take a full course, it
will bring the widest and best contribution possible to their general level of
knowledge and breadth of interests.

Arts and Amenities

Access for all to the best of Britain's cultural heritage is a wider part of our
educational and social purpose, and is one hallmark of a civilised country.
That is why we appointed the first Minister for Arts and Leisure.

The 1965 White Paper, ""Policy for the Arts"", has inspired a coherent,
generous and imaginative approach to the arts and amenities. Already the
situation is being transformed, by substantially increased financial support
for the Arts Council, purchasing grants for museums, and five times the
support for younger artists. A quite new local authority building fund has
been initiated. Next year expenditure on the arts will rise by £2.5 million.

5. Fair Rents and Mortgages

A secure home for everyone is the most important contribution a community
can make to family life. Building houses is only half the job. People need
houses at a cost they can afford; and, once in their homes, they need
protection against exploitation or eviction.

(i) The New Rent Act

The 1957 Tory Rent Act inflicted injury on hundreds of thousands of

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 18 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

families by decontrolling their homes in a period of intense housing
shortage. Labour was pledged to annul this social crime. This we have
done. In addition to restoring security of tenure to every decontrolled
house, we are appointing rent officers and rent assessment committees
for fixing fair rents. The new Act also gives basic protection to almost
everyone in his home, including the lodger and the worker in his tied
cottage. Today it is a crime not merely to evict without a court order but
to harass or to persecute anyone in order to force him out or force his
rent up.

(ii) Leasehold Enfranchisement

For years socialists have crusaded to redress the grievance of the
leaseholder who loses his home without compensation when a long lease
comes to an end.

More thin one million house-owners will benefit from the Leasehold
Enfranchisement Bill which we shall enact.

(iii) A Fair Deal for the Council House Tenant

The new houses we are pledged to build will not help existing tenants of
council houses. Indeed most of them will have to contribute towards
paying for them by increased rents. Within limits this is fair. But in
cities crippled with slums, the burden was becoming too great. Hence
the Government's decision to give special financial relief to selected
authorities so that rent increases can be kept within bounds.

(iv) The new Home Ownership Plan

Those who wish to buy their own homes also need help from the State.
Until now this mainly took the form of tax remissions on mortgage
instalments. The higher the mortgagee's income bracket and the more
expensive his house, the bigger his tax concession. This system is
obviously unfair, particularly since the lower paid get nothing at all.

We have therefore announced a new Home Ownership Plan under
which each mortgagee will have this choice: to retain his present right to
tax concessions - or qualify for a new Government grant which brings
down the interest rate on his mortgage by 2j per cent (subject to a
minimum of 4 per cent).

With the help of this grant many more wage-earners, especially those
with family responsibilities, will be able to buy their own homes.
Everyone who joins the Home Ownership Plan will also benefit from a
new Government Guarantee which will substantially reduce any deposit
he is required to make.

6. Fair Taxation

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 19 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

In an age when taxation is bound to be substantial, it is essential that the
tax system should be fair and intelligible. This has not been true of
Britain for many years. Among the worst injustices has been the heavy
weight of taxation on the average citizen and the very light burden
which) as a result of tax avoidance and other devices, is borne by those
best able to shoulder it.

To remedy this we have already introduced:

1. A Capital Gains Tax which at last brings into the tax system those
large and previously tax-free gains, realised on the sale of shares
and securities.

2. A Measure to deal with Business Expense Accounts, by refusing to
accept such expenses - except where related to export earnings - as
deductions from company or income tax.

3. A Corporation Tax which has the effect both of increasing the
taxation of company profits if dividends are raised) and of
decreasing them where profits are retained.

We now intend to reinforce these remedies with two new measures: a
general tax on betting and gaming, and a Land Levy. The case for the
first need not be argued. The second will deal with the grossest example
of speculative gains - the difference between the value of land at its
existing use and the price received when it is sold for redevelopment.

Reforming the Rates

The most urgent area for tax reform is the rating system. When our
reconstruction of local government has been completed, we shall
introduce major reforms in local finance.

Meanwhile the worst features of the rating system are being put right:

1. The new system of rate rebates to help the two million hardest hit
families should be in operation this year.

2. Anew measure of domestic de-rating will relieve all domestic
ratepayers of about half the annual increase.

3. Empty properties, now free from rates, will make a contribution.

Part 5: Wider Democracy in the New Britain

To create the new Britain we require an immense effort by the whole
community. That effort can only be effective if the machinery of
Government, in all its aspects) is refashioned to meet the needs of a
modern society.

In the next five years, it is not the power of Government that we shall
seek to extend, but its efficiency and intelligence. The truth is that for
many of the tasks that they must perform, our institutions are badly
organised and ill-equipped.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 20 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

In the short time that the Government has been in office) a start has
been made in reorganising the structure of Government Departments;
in setting up new Commissions to overhaul both the Civil Service and
Local Government; in convening a Speaker's Conference to review the
electoral system and in the proposal for a Parliamentary Commissioner
(or ""Ombudsman"") to investigate complaints by the citizens against the
Administration.

Law Commissioners have started to revise, consolidate and modernise
our ancient laws, to bring them into line with the needs of a modern
society. This is a considerable achievement. But it does not go far
enough.

1. Reorganising Whitehall

In the interests of efficiency we shall greatly improve the collection,
processing and organisation of Government information and statistical
services.

We shall streamline the organisation of many departments - for
example, in addition to the new unified Ministry of Social Security, by
integrating the Colonial Office in the Commonwealth Relations Office,
and bringing into the Ministry of Housing, the Ministry of Land and
relevant parts of the Ministry of Public Building and Works.

2. Modernising Parliament

1. Improvement and modernisation of the work of Parliament is
essential to reinforce the democratic element in modern
Government. Changes must improve procedure and the work of
committees, and reform facilities for research and information.

2. Consideration is being given to the broadcasting of Commons
proceedings, in order to bring Parliament closer to the people it
represents, and to increase the sense of public participation in
policy making.

3. The Labour Party has proposed to the Speaker's Conference the
introduction of Votes at Eighteen, to add a necessary political
dimension to the increasingly important economic and social
position of young people.

4. Finally, legislation will be introduced to safeguard measures
approved by the House of Commons from frustration by delay or
defeat in the House of Lords.

3. Immigration

In the field of immigration, we shall continue realistic controls, flexibly
administered, combined with an imaginative and determined
programme to ensure racial equality. Incitement to racial hatred has
been outlawed, and financial support given to the positive work of
promoting racial harmony. A special committee is now studying the law

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 21 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

relating to the position of aliens and Commonwealth immigrants who
are refused entry or threatened with deportation.

4. Law Enforcement

For years Britain has been confronted by a rising crime rate,
overcrowded prisons and many seriously undermanned police forces.

Strengthening the Police

The slide in numbers has already been checked. Energetic action will
now

be taken to build up police strength in those areas confronted with a
severe shortage. We shall ensure not only that police resources are used
more efficiently, but that they receive the most modern scientific and
technological equipment.

There is also an urgent need for fewer - and larger - police forces. This
cannot await the reports of the Royal Commission on Local
Government. We shall, therefore, press ahead with a vigorous
programme of amalgamations, to provide the police with the form of
organisation best suited to the battle against crime.

Proposals for dealing with adult and juvenile offenders have been set
out in two White Papers. Detailed legislative proposals will be presented
early in the next Parliament.

The problem of our out-of-date, overcrowded prisons and borstals
remains. The parole system for adult offenders will ease the pressure on
accommodation to some extent. But our prisons can only provide a
useful reformative influence when we close the doors on some of the
worst survivals of mid-19th-century England and transfer the inmates
to more modern surroundings where they can do work of some social
value.

Part 6: The New Britain and the World

While great tasks await us at home, we must never forget that Britain is
part of a world community; that it is involved in the affairs of mankind;
that in many areas it has special responsibility which it alone must bear;
that it has, more widely, a key role to play.

But what should our objectives be?

e Britain must be committed to realism in Defence;

¢ Britain must work to strengthen the United Nations which is the
main instrument for peace in a divided world;

¢ Britain must promote nuclear disarmament and work to prevent
the spread of nuclear weapons;

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 22 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

e Britain must work to achieve better relations in Europe;

¢ Britain must not fail to contribute to peace-keeping outside
Europe;

e Britain must take the lead in the war on want and deprivation.

1. Realism in Defence

Britain has a key role to play in promoting peaceful change; but
Britain's position has also changed. Although we are a world power with
world responsibilities, this is not the 19th century when Britain ruled
one-quarter of mankind. We have to see ourselves realistically in the
right proportion, not spreading ourselves beyond our means nor failing
in our duty.

Britain's security and influence in the world depend no less on the
strength of her economy than on her military power. Excessive and mis-
directed defence expenditure by Conservative Governments has
weakened our economy without providing forces sufficient to carry out
the tasks imposed on them without dangerous overstrain. Labour has
carried out a comprehensive review of Britain's foreign and defence
policies to rectify this situation.

The Defence Review has achieved its three objectives:

¢ (i) It has brought the runaway growth in our defence expenditure
under control, and made sure that we get value for the money we
spend.

¢ (ii) It has decided what military tasks and political commitments it
will make sense for Britain to undertake within the limits of her
resources.

¢ (iii) It has made certain that our forces will be able to carry out
these tasks, without overstrain, with the full range of weapons
needed for the job.

By bringing defence spending down to a stable level of about 6 per cent
of our national wealth, Labour will be able to direct new capital and
skills to vital industrial modernisation. The country will benefit from
this new realism in defence.

2. The United Nations

The United Nations is mankind's chief instrument for preserving the
rule of law, promoting peaceful change and fighting poverty. When
Labour came to power, the United Nations was rent by dispute. The
Labour Government, by contrast to the habitual Conservative
disparagement of the United Nations, appointed a Foreign Office
Minister to lead Britain's delegation, helped to resolve the dispute,
helped the United Nations to pay its debts and strengthened it by a
pledge to make forces available for peace keeping activities. It was at the
Security Council of the United Nations that Britain explained her policy

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 23 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

for ending the Rhodesian rebellion and won world support to make
sanctions effective. Labour will continue to give full support to the
authority and efficiency of the United Nations.

3. Nuclear Weapons

Within N.A.T.O. we have given over-riding priority to stopping the
further spread of atomic weapons. For this purpose we believe that
Labour's proposal for an Atlantic Nuclear Force remains the best basis
for allied discussions, since it allows for legitimate consultation among
the members of N.A.T.O. while providing firm guarantees against new
fingers on the nuclear trigger. Labour stands by its pledge to
internationalise our strategic nuclear forces.

With the appointment in the Foreign Office of a Minister for
Disarmament, Britain has exercised increasing influence in the Geneva
Disarmament Conference. The Government had a difficult task; the
Conservatives had landed Britain with the political dangers of an
""independent nuclear deterrent"" without in fact producing a deterrent
that was truly independent. Labour's immediate objectives are
agreements to stop all nuclear tests and prevent the spread of nuclear
weapons; further, Labour will seek agreements to create nuclear-free
zones and make possible agreed and verified inter national
disarmament.

4. Better Relations in Europe

In seeking to relax tensions in Europe we need to keep the confidence of
our allies and to reach understanding with the East. We must be both
ready to reach agreement and determined to resist threats. Labour,
there fore, firmly supports N.A.T.O. and has greatly increased Britain's
contact and understanding with the Soviet Union and other countries of
Eastern Europe. By the end of this year Labour Ministers will have
visited nearly all of those countries. By such contact we shall encourage
trade and travel and promote that growth of trust which is essential to
progress towards disarmament and assured peace. This progress
towards normalisation of our relations with Eastern Europe is an
essential part of our whole European policy.

Britain is a member of the European Free Trade Association, which is a
thriving organisation beneficial to us and to our partners. The Labour
Government has taken the lead in promoting an approach by E.F.T.A.
to the countries of the European Economic Community so that Western
Europe shall not be sharply divided into two conflicting groups. Labour
believes that Britain, in consultation with her E.F.T.A. partners, should
be ready to enter the European Economic Community, provided
essential British and Commonwealth interests are safeguarded.

The Conservative record on relations between Britain and the ""Six"" is
one of notorious and abject failure. Yet Conservatives now talk as if they

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 24 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

could take Britain into the Common Market without any conditions or
safeguards.

Labour believes that close contact with Europe - joint industrial
ventures, scientific co-operation, political and cultural links - can
produce among the ""Six"" that understanding of Britain's position which
is necessary to a wider European unity.

5. Peace-keeping Outside Europe

But it is the world outside Europe that now presents the greatest
challenge and the greatest danger to mankind. The greatest problem in
Asia is the future of China; this nation could render immeasurable
service to mankind, but at present she is embittered and distrustful of
the West and menacing to her neighbours. The Labour Government has
worked and will continue to work for the granting to the Chinese
Government of her rightful place in the Security Council of the United
Nations, believing that there her differences with the rest of the world
can best be resolved.

Meanwhile the cruel war in Vietnam continues; Labour has consistently
urged negotiations to stop the fighting and a settlement which would
enable the peoples of North and South Vietnam to determine their own
future and which would ensure that the whole country became neutral,
without foreign troops or bases. Labour welcomes the readiness of the
United States to negotiate on these lines; we still await an equal
readiness from North Vietnam. The Labour Government has, through
many channels, urged on North Vietnam the wisdom of making peace
and these efforts will be continued.

It is through her membership of the Commonwealth that Britain has the
best opportunity for contributing to the advancement and well-being of
so many peoples in the developing world on the basis of mutual trust
and co-operation. Labour created the modern Commonwealth. We have
always attached great importance to it as a unique association of
peoples, spanning different races and continents of the world.

The Commonwealth needs further new development, if it is to remain a
coherent force in world affairs. During the past year, Labour has taken,
with the Commonwealth, a number of important initiatives which will
greatly affect its future.

Firstly: We have established a Secretariat which will be concerned with
planning the future political, organisational and economic relationships
of Commonwealth countries.

Secondly: The Commonwealth, as such, took an unprecedented
Initiative for peace in establishing the Peace Mission to try to end the
tragic conflict in Vietnam. While this initiative was not successful, it
nevertheless points to a further and most important development of the
Commonwealth.

Page 25 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

Thirdly: Britain has made clear, particularly in the confrontation
between Malaysia and Indonesia, her willingness to assist the new
Commonwealth nations when faced with external aggression.

Labour will continue to foster the development of the Commonwealth
by participating fully in schemes for financial, economic and technical
co-operation.

In just over a year independence arrangements have been made for a
quarter of Britain's remaining Colonial subjects, and a new status,
carrying with it the right to opt for independence, has been offered to
six Eastern Caribbean islands. This new status is an exciting adventure
in Common wealth relations and may well prove a model for other small
communities who wish to free themselves from any Colonial stigma and
yet remain in close association with Britain.

Constitutional changes have been made in other Colonies, and Labour's
policy remains:

To give independence to all territories which want it and can sustain it.
To help all other small dependencies which are unlikely to be able to
stand on their own feet to achieve a new post-Colonial status of dignity
in association with Britain.

6. The War on Want

In spite of the tremendous economic difficulties we faced, Labour has
increased the flow of external aid to developing nations both inside and
outside the Commonwealth. The effectiveness of this aid has been
greatly increased by the co-ordination and careful scrutiny of
programmes undertaken by the new Ministry of Overseas Development
While there is an obvious limit to the volume of capital that Britain can
afford to export, very much more can be done and will be done to
promote the flow of technical advice and assistance. In particular we
shall multiply our efforts to assist overseas development through the
export of knowledge. The flow of experts will be stimulated by
redoubling the recruitment efforts of the Ministry of Overseas
Development and by continued support of recruitment by voluntary
bodies, private agencies, foundations and the British Council.

We shall make our aid more effective by helping recipient countries to
plan their development and to select worthwhile projects on which to
spend our aid. We shall continue to lighten the burden of debt by
softening the terms of aid. For we recognise that ""aid"" can be negated
by ""trade"" unless a concerted world effort is made to enable overseas
countries to earn the foreign exchange essential to their development
programmes. Labour will play a positive part at next year's United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development. We intend to put our
full weight behind constructive inter national proposals for increasing
and stabilising the export earnings of primary producing countries
through international commodity agreements and arrangements for

http://labourmanifesto.com/1966/1966-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 26 of 27

1966 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

finance; for reduction of trade barriers; and for increasing liquidity for
financing world trade, with particular emphasis on schemes for linking
the creation of new credits to the needs of underdeveloped countries.

By such means a Labour Government will mobilise increasing resources
- in money, expert advice and voluntary effort - to make war on want.

Postscript

This postscript is also a preface - an introduction to (we believe) four or
five years of Labour Government with the Parliamentary majority
needed to carry through our plan for a better Britain.

We have already shown that, even with a tiny majority, Labour
Government works. But it would be foolish to pretend that we can do all
that we mean to do with such a majority; for, make no mistake about it,
some of our projects will be bitterly resisted by those whose privileges
and interests are threatened.

Already the pattern and the mood are clear. Even Tories admit, in
private, that the conduct of Harold Wilson and his colleagues has been
far more firm and decisive than they thought it could be. This is a
Government that governs: it does not flop along from crisis to crisis as
the Tories did, for so much of their 13 years.

Moreover, the motive and inspiration of Labour remain, and always will
remain, to secure the prosperity and welfare of all the people - the
workers by hand and by brain who must be the backbone of our
economic recovery, the old, the sick and the children.

This is not a selfish motive - but you will be doing yourself and your
family a good turn by voting Labour on 31st March. After all, you know
Labour Government works.

1970 Labour Party Manifesto

Now Britain's Strong - Let's Make it Great to
Live In

 

The British people took a historic decision in 1964 and 1966. It was not two
decisions but one decision.

On Thursday, 18 June, many more of the same people - together with
millions who have never had a chance of voting before - can take this
decision a big stage further. For it takes more than six years to modernise
and humanise an advanced industrial country and move it on towards a new
kind of greatness.

Part 1: The Britain We Want

Our purpose is to create, on the firm base of a steadily growing economy, a
better society for all the people of Britain: a strong, just and compassionate
society, one where the handling of complex problems may be a source of
pride to ourselves and an example to the world.

Our appeal is to those who have faith in the capacity and humanity of their
fellow-men, and to those who are not solely moved by the search for profit
or the hope of personal gain.

First, we believe that Britain's potential for improvement is enormous.
Science, technology and the general growth of knowledge present great
opportunities for social and economic advance. With foresight, intelligence
and effort - with planning - we can harness the new technologies and the
powerful economic forces of our time to human ends.

But, without planning, with a return to the Tory free-for-all, people become
the victims of economic forces they cannot control.

Second, we believe that the contribution that ordinary people can make to
our present welfare and national future is still largely untapped and
undeveloped. People want more responsibility. It is this that makes us wish
to extend opportunities for everyone to have a bigger say in making
decisions, whether in their local community or in their place of work. It is
this, too, that makes us place the highest priority on education and
educational reform.

These are not the aims of the Tory Party. They have always defended the
power and privileges of the few.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

Third, we believe that society can now afford and must be ready to meet the
basic needs of all its members. There should be decent housing for everyone;
slums and overcrowding must be dealt with; immigrant ghettoes must not be
allowed to develop. There should be work for those who seek it, in the
nation as a whole and in every region.

We must make a rising standard of provision for those who, on account of
age, sickness or other circumstances, are unable to provide for themselves. A
compassionate society is one that does not grudge help for those in need.

We reject the Tory view that misfortune is a private, not a social, concern,
that medical care should depend on what people can pay rather than on what
people require and that social expenditure should be ruthlessly pruned.

Fourth, we believe that all people are entitled to be treated as equals: that
women should have the same opportunities and rewards as men. We insist,
too, that society should not discriminate against minorities on grounds of
religion or race or colour: that all should have equal protection under the law
and equal opportunity for advancement in and service to the community.

Many of our opponents believe this, too, but today as often in the past the
extension of human rights has had to wait for a Labour Government. Fifth,
we believe that we have a duty to the future; to ensure that the Britain we
leave to the generation that follows is not spoilt by our misuse or neglect of
the environment.

We are still dealing with the slums, slag-heaps, derelict land and foul rivers
of the first industrial revolution. Today we have to manage our own lives ina
new industrial society so that we do not spoil our land, our water, our
beaches - even the air we breathe - with noise, fumes, filth and waste.

This will only be done by a Party which is not the creature of private profit.

Sixth, we are proud of the contribution that Britain and its people have made
and are making to the welfare of mankind. With our resources, our
experience and our unique connections, we have a large and continuing part
to play in solving world problems.

The Tories still see their role primarily in terms of overseas bases and a
costly and out-of-date type of military presence in the Far East. We see our
role primarily in helping the poorer countries to develop and in the stand we
take on basic issues of colour and race, while maintaining as loyal members
of the U.N. a general defence capability based on Europe but ready and
trained for international peace-keeping operations elsewhere.

We believe our defence effort should now be concentrated inside Europe,
contributing to collective security through NATO and to the constant search
for East-West détente and real European security. We shall play our full part
in creating a more secure, prosperous and united Europe.

The Britain we want is one we shall have to build together. It will not be
easy to achieve; but our deeply rooted democracy, our tradition of tolerance

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

and fairness, our confidence in ourselves, are enormous assets on which we
can draw.

But it is a far more attractive society, with a far greater potential for human
happiness, than the selfish, cold, ruthlessly competitive model that our
opponents want.

Part 2: Eight Main Tasks

Our jobs, our living standards, and the role of Britain in the World all depend
on our ability to earn our living as a nation. That is why Britain has to pay
her way in trade and transactions with the outside world.

In the last financial year, 1969/70, our national surplus was £550 million -
the largest we have ever had.

Only five years ago, the outgoing Tory Government left the largest deficit
ever recorded in our history - running at minus £800m. and this was only
the culminating year of a long period of economic decline. So in just five
years, Labour has registered an improvement of more than £1,300m.

We have got out of the red in our national accounts. We are now strong and
solvent and we intend to remain so.

It is particularly important to have this strength in the dangerous world
which confronts us today. No one can look beyond our shores and say with
certainty there are no storms ahead; but we can now face them from a much
better base than in the years of balance of payments weakness.

1. A Strong Economy

Provided that we continue with measures to strengthen the economy and
provided that we do not return to the do-nothing complacency of the Tory
years, we have good prospects for maintaining our new competitiveness and
of keeping our economy in surplus.

It remains, of course, an essential task of economic management to ensure
that a substantial part of our output is available for exports - and is not
absorbed by excessive home consumption. It is equally the task of economic
management to see to it that the correct balance is struck between private
and public spending and the need for investment in industry.

The irresponsible tax bribes that the Tories now promise - and threaten -
would wreck the economy. These crude electoral manoeuvres would cause
raging inflation; be a recipe for economic disaster - or a signal for savage
cuts in essential social services.

Steady Expansion

Our central aim is a steady and sustained increase of output with secure and

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

rising employment - and the avoidance of the violent stop-go cycles that
have done so much damage to our economy in past years.

Since the number of people of working age in Britain will not increase for a
number of years the rate of economic expansion and the increase in our
standard of living will depend on productivity: and getting more output from
the same number of people.

The factors which will affect productivity most are the quality of
management; the skills and performance of people at work; the quality of the
plant and equipment that they use; and the organisation and structure of
British industry.

(a) Investment in Industry

Expenditure on new plant and equipment in industry has been higher in
every year since 1964 than in the peak year of Tory rule. While we have
done well by our own past standards, investment in much of British industry
is still insufficient in relation to our main competitors. We shall therefore
continue to encourage industrial investment in the years ahead.

In the public sector large but essential investment programmes are being
carried out in the railways, the national air-lines, the telecommunications
industries, in the rapid exploitation of North Sea gas and in the supply of
electricity.

(b) People and Jobs

If Britain is to develop her full potential, we must recognise that men and
women are even more important than the machines they use. As our
industrial structure changes we must see that workers are not left stranded by
technological change. We must help them to acquire the skills they need to
man the new industries; offer them a wider choice of job opportunity.

This is why the Labour Government has been reorganising and re-equipping
our employment services, moving in swiftly to deal with redundancies,
placing workers more quickly in employment with the help of modern
techniques.

This is why we have carried out the biggest expansion of industrial training
in Britain's history. Over 1,400,000 people are now being trained, including
500,000 apprentices.

The main responsibility lies with the Industrial Training Boards, of which 28
have now been established, covering 15m.workpeople. But the G.T.C.s have
a vital role to play helping to meet urgent shortages of skilled labour and to
retrain redundant workers for new jobs, particularly in the development
areas.

Labour has increased the number of centres from 26 to 45 with more to
come. As part of their economy drive in 1962-3, the Tories actually closed

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

two centres down.

The Government has now set on foot plans to create a National Manpower
Service as a modern instrument of manpower intelligence, the forward
planning of our manpower needs and the creation of greater job
opportunities. The Central Training Council is also being given a more
important role in co-ordinating industrial training over the whole field.

(c) Industrial Reorganisation and Planning

Industrial reorganisation, with its emphasis on better management, is crucial
to the success - even to the survival - of much of British industry.

We must continue to tackle on an industry basis, and where necessary firm
by firm, the more detailed problems of structure which exist in both public
and private industry. We shall strengthen the direct relations between the
trade unions and Government in industrial policy matters.

Industry - whether private or public - must be accountable for its major
decisions. Government investment must carry with it an assurance that a real
share of any profit accrues to the nation.

Publicly owned industries are playing a key role in our industrial
transformation. The reorganisation of transport is well under way and the
coal industry has been given the help it has urgently needed in its task of
adjusting to rapid change.

We shall continue to assist the coal industry and we shall carry through
further reorganisation measures in both the gas and electricity industries.

The old restrictions on the activities of the nationalised industries are being
removed. The new Post Office Corporation with its Giro service and data
processing facilities, and the Gas Council with its British Hydrocarbon
Company are opening up a new and more competitive concept of public
enterprise. With new techniques and resources, there is a growing potential
for joint action by these industries.

We also stress the contribution that can be made by co-operative enterprise.
This is already a large sector in the economy, and operates on democratic
criteria which we would like to see extended. The Labour Party is therefore
considering the establishment of a Co-operative Development Agency to
give added strength to the rationalisation and development of co-operatives.

In the private sector, particular industries are now undergoing far-reaching
structural change, following detailed studies and deliberate Government
commitment to reform - e.g. nuclear energy, shipbuilding, machine tools and
computers.

The Industrial Reorganisation Corporation has been associated with more

than 30 mergers, all geared to better structure and more efficient
management - and many of them, such as heavy electrical machinery, motor

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

cars and electronics, are in industries which are crucial to our exports. The
Corporation has the power, which it has exercised, to take equity shares in
the companies it assists.

In the next Parliament, we shall provide additional finance for the ILR.C. We
shall further redeploy and reorganise the Government's Research and
Development resources in the support of civil industry.

It is our purpose to develop a new relationship with both sides of industry, in
which the forward plans of both Government and industry can be
increasingly harmonised in the interests of economic growth. In the public
and private sectors, industrial enterprises are paying increasing attention to
medium and long term planning. In a rapidly changing economy, our plans
have to be flexible, but it is of the utmost importance that these processes
should develop. It is not private industry but Tory Party doctrine that rejects
planning. The Industrial Reorganisation Corporation and the powers of the
Industrial Expansion Act are valuable and flexible instruments of public
enterprise for furthering industrial policies.

We do not regard public initiative in industry as confined either to total
private or total public ownership. Partnership ventures are sometimes a
better solution - e.g. the Bus plant sited in the North of England, aluminium
smelters, and the Scottish Transport Group.

We shall pursue these principles, based on our determination to see progress
in all sectors of the economy. The establishment of a Holding and
Development Company to exploit these possibilities, with special regard to
regional development needs, may well be necessary.

We shall push ahead with the search for and exploitation of gas and oil under
the North Sea, and our new measures to facilitate the development of
mineral deposits in Britain.

With continued progress in training, investment, industrial reorganisation,
import saving, and planning, we should be able to achieve a faster rate of
economic expansion than we have had before. But progress will depend to a
very marked extent on the policies pursued and the managerial efficiency of
the very large firms - who must be accountable to the community.

It is the Government's intention, therefore, to set up a Commission on
Industry and Manpower - merging the N.B.P.I. and the Monopolies
Commission - with a special duty to report on costs, prices and efficiency in
various industries and to stimulate competition in large and monopolistic
firms.

(d) Fighting Inflation
The biggest challenge facing any industrial nation today, is how to expand

the economy without pushing up its costs. The answer lies in increasing our
productivity.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

Only in this way can we keep our lead over our competitors and ensure an
improvement in the real standard of life for our people.

Over the last five years, with little help from the Tories, the Labour
Government has been hammering this lesson home. The Prices and Incomes
Board has done invaluable work in spelling out how wage increases can be
paid for by increased productivity and in scrutinising (and, where necessary,
rejecting) the case for price increases. Its work will be continued by the
Commission on Industry and Manpower.

Devaluation inevitably pushed up prices - as we warned it would do. Even
so, as a result of Government vigilance, prices rose much less than they
otherwise would have done. If wage increases were now to be linked to
increases in production, we should be able to look forward to greater price
stability.

The Government has taken a number of steps to encourage this. It has
controlled rent increases by law, thus reducing the increases which would
otherwise have taken place. It has kept rates down by rate relief for every
domestic ratepayer now running at is. 8d. in the pound. The budget was
carefully designed to encourage price stability.

The whole Tory economic strategy, by contrast, is based on policies which
would push prices up. The Tories would abolish rent control and reduce
housing subsidies so rents would rise to astronomical levels; they would
abolish Exchequer subsidies to farmers so food prices would rise by an
amount which it is impossible to estimate; they would increase taxes on
goods and services in order to reduce direct taxes on the better off. Having
abolished S.E.T. they would put other, more inflationary taxes in its place.
Their whole budget policy would depend upon the deliberate introduction of
a value-added tax which would mean a levy of 4s. in the pound on a wide
range of essential goods and services so far exempt from tax; children's
clothing, fares, coal, gas, electricity, laundries, theatres, sport and so on.

Food prices have been rising. Rising all over the world. But it is generally
acknowledged that our food prices are a long way below those of other
western countries. Over the last twelve months, the cost of living has risen at
a faster rate than in Britain, in Canada, France, Portugal, Ireland, Turkey,
Sweden, the United States, Japan and Norway. Under Tory policies, the
British people would face the sort of price increases we have seen in these
countries.

Under a Labour Government, people and industry will co-operate in a new
effort to keep prices down.

(e) Food and Farming

The importance to the economy of British agriculture is beyond question.
Our policies will continue to be devised to the benefit of the farmer as well
as the consumer.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

We intend, first, to promote an expanding farm industry. This policy is based
on the proved system of guaranteed prices and production grants. However,
we are continuing to develop arrangements for greater market stability; we
have recognised the need for clear long-term objectives; and for the first
time have introduced successive long-term programmes for agricultural
expansion.

We shall continue all that we are doing to improve life in the rural
community.

2. Prosperity in the Regions

We are determined to see that employment, prosperity and opportunity are
spread more evenly through the different regions of our country.

The aim of a Labour Government is to keep the country's resources fully
used. Britain no longer suffers from mass, long-term unemployment. In
some areas there is an acute shortage of labour. Unemployment today is
largely a problem of the development and intermediate areas.

That is why a Labour Government has pursued and will pursue a vigorous
policy of regional development.

In the long period of Tory rule up to 1964, prosperity ebbed away from large
areas of Britain; economic expansion was heavily concentrated in the
Midlands and the South.

The areas where the older basic industries were declining - Scotland, Wales,
the North, the North West, and the far South West - suffered continued high
unemployment coupled with the loss of many of their young people as they
moved to the South in search of work. The areas of expansion in the
Midlands and the South East suffered from ever-increasing congestion, with
acute shortages of housing and land.

The pace of industrial change has quickened; one industry alone, the coal
industry, has lost 300,000 jobs in the past five years. Without a massive
development of regional planning, large parts of our country would be
economic disaster areas today.

It is here, in the least prosperous regions, that the human impact of
technological change is most keenly felt. And it is here that we have tried
hardest 40 protect the families and communities from this impact. It is here
that we have insisted on the longest possible advance warning of impending
change; it is here that we have intervened in shipbuilding to save jobs, as in
the coal mines to defer closures. It is here that redundancy payments and
earnings-related pensions are of the greatest value. And it is here, too, that
we are obliged to bring new work and new opportunity.

But regional planning has been massively developed and for the first time,

over the whole of Britain. Through its regional planning machinery, the
Government has constructed an increasingly clear and detailed picture of the

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

economic situation in the different areas of Britain. The Government is
therefore able to plan ahead to meet the need for new jobs in different parts
of the country.

We have defined with increasing accuracy, first the Development Areas, then
the Special Development Areas, and, most recently, the New Intermediate
Areas. These are all areas that need, in different degrees of urgency,
assistance in the supply of new jobs.

Firms wishing to build new factories and offices in areas where work is
already plentiful have been stringently controlled through the industrial and
office location machinery. At the same time Industrial Development
Certificates have been freely issued to firms wishing to expand in areas of
high unemployment. But controls, though essential, are not enough. Where
serious economic disadvantages arose for firms operating in the development
areas, many kinds of special assistance were granted: investment grants at
double the national rate; regional employment premium at 30s. a week per
man employed; modern factories built for rent by them and in advance of
their needs.

The special development areas - those where the coal industry is declining -
receive additional aid to help meet running costs and factory rentals.

Public enterprise also plays an important part in regional development and
this we mean to extend.

In the intermediate areas, which have important problems of their own,
assistance is now being given through freely granted Industrial Development
Certificates and also through advanced factories and training grants. These
measures are recent and we shall keep a close watch on their effectiveness,
with a constant review of their impact and of the areas they cover.

Now the Tories have singled out regional policy for major cuts in public
expenditure. They have pledged themselves to end the regional employment
premium and they have also committed themselves to scrap investment
grants. But without these important financial aids, the supply of industry to
the areas of need would be greatly reduced.

We intend to continue with our regional policies so long as they are needed.
We shall seek new ways to make them more effective. In particular, we shall
try to ensure that office location plays a bigger part in regional development,
and stop speculative office building and end the situation where offices in
congested areas are left empty, while developers negotiate extortionate rents.
We shall be ready to extend assistance to other areas of the country that may
be hard hit by industrial change.

3. Better Communications
A modern transport system in which people and goods can move quickly,
cheaply and safely throughout the country is an essential national

requirement. Under the Tories, road and rail were totally uncoordinated; road

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

building was allowed to fall far behind the growth of road vehicles; our
docks and ports were neglected; the development of air services had little
purpose beyond the barely concealed desire to weaken the national airlines
BEA and BOAC.

The Labour Government is now engaged in a major and planned programme
for expanding and modernising our whole transport system.

(i) The Road Programme

Six years ago less than 300 miles of motorway were open and only 130
miles were being built. In March, 1970, 650 miles of motorway were open to
traffic and nearly 400 miles under construction. Expenditure on roads
generally has been doubled.

The target of 1,000 miles of motorway in England and Wales will be
completed by the end of 1972. The road programme will be further extended
as we embark upon the recently announced inter-urban road programme
which will double the capacity of the trunk road system by the end of the
1980s. Altogether by the end of that period there will be some 6,000 miles of
motorway and new and improved roads open to traffic.

(ii) Road Safety

We must cut down on the number of road casualties. In the last five years
while the number of vehicles on the road has risen by a quarter, the number
of people killed and seriously injured has been substantially reduced. This
welcome development follows on a series of measures we have introduced,
including much more stringent control over the mechanical safety of road
vehicles. But it reflects most of all the controversial - and courageous - Road
Safety Act of 1967 which greatly checked the menace of drunken driving by
introducing the breathalyser test.

Our efforts to reduce road casualties will continue.
(iii) Rail and Road

To cut out the old and wasteful competition between road and rail we have
established the new National Freight Corporation. Through the liner train
and container services our aim is to develop a first rate integrated public
service for freight and relieve the increasing pressure upon the roads by
switching goods on to our under-used rail system.

At the same time, we intend to improve further the speed and comfort of rail

passenger services by investing in modernisation of track and in new rolling
stock.

(iv) The Ports

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

In the next Parliament, we shall complete the programme for change in our
ports and docks on which we are now advanced. We shall bring the nation's
major ports under a National Port Authority to which new local port
authorities will be responsible. We shall give each port authority the power
to take over and reorganize the principal dock activities within its port area.
We shall give workers' representatives more say in the way in which ports
are run.

Already we have ended the system of casual labour in the docks and we
have greatly improved amenities and pay. Further, a large programme for
modernising our docks is under way aimed at providing new deep water
berths and modern methods of cargo handling. Investment in the ports has
risen from £18m. in 1964 to £50m. in 1969.

But we are convinced, given its history, its problems and its special
circumstances, that only a major reorganisation under new and responsible
public authorities, will make it possible to overcome the deep-seated
problems of this industry.

(v) Air Services

It is our aim to develop our national airways so that they can handle the
increasing growth of air traffic and compete successfully with other national
airlines.

We propose to set up an Airways Board to ensure that the fleets of BOAC
and BEA are planned together to get the best overall advantage. We shall
also seek to establish a strong regional airline, able to provide regular
services between the different parts of the United Kingdom.

4. Education and Social Equality

Britain is now spending more on education than ever before. This has
brought improvements in the quality of education - more teachers and better
schools - and the rapid enlargement of opportunity in our secondary schools,
our colleges of education and in higher education as a whole.

This increased expenditure reflects our belief - that all children can benefit
from a broader and deeper education; that the rich variety of talent that exists
must be given the widest possible chance to develop; and that it will make a
major contribution to the welfare, quality and happiness of our society.

Our first priority has been to end the system under which 80 per cent of our
nation's children were, at the age of eleven, largely denied the opportunity of
a broad secondary education with the chance of higher education beyond.

Comprehensive reorganisation has been vigorously pursued. In the past six
years 129 of the 163 English and Welsh local education authorities have
agreed plans for reorganising their secondary schools.

This progress must not be checked; it must go forward. We shall legislate to

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

require the minority of Tory education authorities who have so far resisted
change to abandon eleven plus selection in England and Wales. We have
legislated to end fee-paying in Scotland, and we intend to legislate further to
ensure that no local authority in Scotland can maintain an area of privilege
which destroys the full benefit of comprehensive reorganisation for its
children.

School building has proceeded at a record level; 13 new schools a week have
been completed in the first five years of the Labour Government, compared
with less than 9 in the last five years of Tory rule.

In the next five years, we shall put more resources, both teachers and
building, into the primary schools and expand nursery schools provision
both in, and outside, the educational priority areas.

We intend to make further progress, now that the supply of teachers has been
increased, towards our aim of reducing to 30 the size of all classes in our
schools.

We shall introduce for England and Wales a new Education Bill to replace
the 1944 and subsequent Acts. One of our aims will be to bring parents and
teachers into a closer partnership in the running of our schools.

In 1972 we shall raise the school leaving age to 16. Preparations for this -
increasing the supply of teachers, extending the school building programme,
and planning a new course for the extra year - are now well advanced.

We shall still further expand higher education. Already since 1964 the
number of young people in full time higher education, including the
universities, has almost doubled. We are in transition to a new era where
higher education, traditionally the preserve of a small educational elite,
could become available to a wider section of the community. This expansion
will require very careful planning. We shall undertake an early review of the
whole field, including universities, polytechnics, higher further education
and the colleges of education.

We have never believed that education and educational opportunity should
stop at the school leaving age; nor that further education should be confined
to full-time students in colleges and universities.

The capacity of people to learn and their desire to learn continues at all ages.
It is, therefore, essential that provisions should be made for people, for
adults of all ages, to re-enter the education system. To provide such an
opportunity for those who have missed higher education, we have created
the Open University, which will commence next year, with 25,000 students -
almost half the annual intake of all our other universities together.

Social Equality

The widening and extension of education is the best preparation that we can
make for our people and our country for the world of tomorrow. Investment

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

in people is also the best way of developing a society based on tolerance, co-
operation and greater social equality.

The education system itself must not perpetuate educational and social
inequalities; that is one reason why full integration of secondary education is
essential.

But progress in the field of education must be accompanied by measures to
deal with social and economic inequalities elsewhere.

Until Labour came to power, those living off capital gains or land profits
were allowed to substantially escape the net of taxation. We have dealt with
this, and similar problems, through the Capital Gains Tax, Land Levy,
Expense Accounts, Gaming Levy and by removing some loopholes in
covenants and in Estate Duty. We shall continue to close loopholes.

There is much more to do to achieve a fairer distribution of wealth in our
community. A Labour Government will continue its work to create a fairer
tax system: we shall ensure that tax burdens are progressively eased from
those least able to bear them and that there is a greater contribution to the
National Revenue from the rich.

5. A Great Place to Live

For far too long Britain has been, side by side, two nations - one, in the
better suburbs of our major cities and elsewhere, where good housing, access
to the countryside, expensive amenities, clean air and leisure facilities were
taken for granted; the other, in our city centres and industrial areas, where
slum housing, 19th century schools and hospitals, congested services and
general lack of amenities are still widespread.

The ways which we have chosen to deal with these problems of improving
life - through community spending and the planned allocation of resources -
are anathema to the whole philosophy of Toryism. Even today, when Britain
is so obviously becoming a better place to live in, they are committed to
slashing housing subsidies, cutting public expenditure, and relaxing laws
which govern land use.

Housing

Housing has been and will continue to be a main priority of Labour's social
policy. Rachmanism was dealt with in 1964 by legislation which brought
protection from eviction and harassment. The disastrous free-market in rents
was abolished by the 1965 Rent Act. A new and more generous system of
housing subsidies has made possible a major increase in council building
and many families have been helped with house purchasing, especially by
favourable mortgage rates under our Option Scheme.

Substantial progress has been made. In our first five years we have built
2,000,000 new homes. In their last five years of office the Tories built

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

1,600,000. Not only have we increased the number, but we have insisted
upon marked improvements in housing standards, in both public and private
sectors.

Private landlord rents in unfurnished homes are determined under the ‘fair
rents' machinery and all tenants have been protected. Rent increases in the
public sector are limited. Labour introduced legislation; the Tories opposed
it.

New and more generous grants have been provided under the 1969 Act both
to prevent the decay of older houses through neglect and to give their
occupants modern amenities. This will be of particular value in the so-called
twilight areas of our large cities.

The scandal of a leaseholder losing his home without compensation has been
ended by our Enfranchisement Act. One million leaseholders have been
granted this right.

The Next Stage

But although much has been done Britain still has - particularly in the great
conurbations - a major housing problem. A high level of building must
continue, and while shortages exist, rent control policies must remain. There
is no place for saving money on the nation's housing.

As a direct result of decisions by Tory councils, there has been a fall in the
number of houses completed. It is essential that this short-term trend in
house-building be reversed, and we shall take whatever steps are necessary,
including the provision of credit, to ensure this.

Home ownershlp will be further encouraged. For the first time in our history,
50 per cent of the nation's homes are now owner-occupied. We believe that
this proportion will rise and should continue to rise.

Exceptionally high rates of interest throughout the world are keeping
borrowing rates in Britain high - and although local authority lending has
been greatly increased - to £155m. this year - and although with the help of
Save As You Earn the flow of money to our building societies is now
adequate, high lending rates are a serious obstacle to would-be owner-
occupiers.

We shall, therefore, in discussion with the building societies, work out new
ways of extending home ownership; in particular we shall seek to reduce the
amount that has to be paid in the initial deposit; through local authorities and
in consultation with Building Societies we shall extend the system of 100
per cent mortgages, and seek to lighten the burden of repayment in the first
few years of occupation. As interest rates generally turn down, we shall
expect the building societies to follow suit.

Finally, we shall see to it that the ‘fair rents' machinery which now operates
in unfurnished private dwellings is extended to furnished rented homes.

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12
Urban Priority Areas

The worst of our housing problem exists in the inner areas of our large cities.
But, serious as slums and overcrowding are, the problems in these areas are
not just confined to housing. It is here, for example, that many of our
remaining 7,000 pre-1870 schools are located; it is here that many
immigrants settle; by and large it is the oldest urban areas where greatest
shortages exist in social resources of all kinds.

The Labour Government has introduced new policies to meet this problem:

1. Housing Priority Areas: All these areas of special need are within
housing priority areas which will continue to receive special help in
house building.

2. Educational Priority Areas: Over £30m. extra expenditure on school
building is being concentrated in areas with the worst slum schools.

3. Urban Programme: £25m. is being spent on an Urban Programme
covering about 100 separate local authorities, including the provision
of nursery schools and facilities for the under-fives.

Financial aid has also been given to voluntary agencies such as housing
associations, which have a valuable role to play, particularly in renewing old
houses.

The £25m. allocated to the Urban Programme will be spent by 1972. The
Government will then extend the programme and increase the amount. In the
years 1972/6 a new programme costing up to a further £40m. will be carried
out.

Even with Labour's new high levels of expenditure on housing and welfare,
hospitals, and social services generally, the areas of greatest social need will
lag behind for many years to come.

That is why we intend now to develop the programmes mentioned above and
to extend the principle of Priority Areas into spending on other services, so
that we focus additional resources on areas with the greatest problems. We
shall discuss with Local Authorities whether additional machinery - an
Urban Renewal Agency, with powers and functions similar to those of a new
town corporation - is required. This will be one of the important parts of our
campaign against poverty.

New Towns

The development of existing English new towns is continuing in Lancashire,
the Midlands, the North East and the Home Counties, and we are forging
ahead with new towns in Peterborough, Northampton, Warrington, Milton
Keynes and central Lancashire. In Wales progress is being made with
expansion at Cwmbran and Newtown, and surveys at Llantrisant. Glasgow
overspill problems are being tackled by special projects at Erskine and in
Lanarkshire and another New Town at Irvine.

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

Studies will shortly be completed of the potential of Humberside,
Severnside, Deeside and Tayside as major new centres should future
population growth require them.

Opportunities for Leisure

Leisure, and the opportunities to pursue a wide range of recreational and
cultural activities, must not be limited by lack of facilities.

Labour's commitment to developing opportunities for leisure has therefore
been immense:

1. The Arts: Our aim is to make sure that enjoyment of the arts is not
something remote from everyday life or removed from the realities of
home and work. Government spending on the arts has been more than
doubled. Local arts centres, regional film theatres, municipally owned
and aided theatres, national and local museums have been established
or modernised. A National Theatre and National Film School, after
decades of Tory delay, are now being established.

2. Sport: Labour's National Sports Council and the nine Regional Sports
Councils are developing facilities and identifying recreational needs in
sport. The next step is to assist in the establishment of regional sports
centres. We shall encourage the design of new schools so that they can
also serve as multi-purpose sports centres for the adult community.
200 schools are already being designed for this purpose. We shall seek
to cater for the growth sports, golfing, squash, sailing and so on.
Angling is one of our most popular sports and we shall give special
attention to its two great problems of greater access to fishing waters
and to the prevention of pollution.

3. Countryside: The Countryside Commissions have wide powers to
encourage and aid the provision of Country Parks and general
amenities and facilities. One important development from this
legislation has been the opening of eleven long-distance footpath
routes - the most famous being the Pennine Way.

4. Tourism: Every year more and more tourists from overseas are
finding Britain a vital and interesting place to visit. Our historic cities
are a major attraction, and the Labour Government has initiated
studies in the conservation of the ancient centres of these cities.

New Local Authorities

We shall carry through in the next Parliament a major reorganisation of local
government. Strong units of local government will make possible much
more effective town and country planning.

Reform of local government finance will also be necessary. Urgent action
has already been taken to deal with the worst features of the rating system.
Rate rebates are now helping nearly one million families. We propose to
invite, through the publication of a Green Paper, widespread debate of future
changes in local taxation.

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12
A Cleaner Britain

These, then, are Labour's priorities in making Britain a better place to live;
Housing, New Towns, Urban Renewal and opportunities for varied and
stimulating leisure pursuits. We must take far better care of our physical
environment. This means considerable attention to clean air, waste disposal,
industrial effluents, the coastline, dereliction, noise, pesticides and all other
problems of pollution - no matter how they arise.

Already we have made progress in clearing derelict land.' The acreage
cleared has risen from 151 in 1964 to 1,324 last year. It is our aim now to
raise - the £2m. expenditure programme of last year to £6m. by 1974.

Second, we are tackling the increasing problem of oil pollution. We shall
legislate to ratify the new international agreement on discharges at sea and
increase penalties against ships that break it.

Third, we shall take further steps to reduce aircraft noise. We have already
approved an aircraft noise certification scheme that will cut the permitted
noise levels of all new sub-sonic airliners.

Fourth, we shall legislate for effective control over the use of pesticides.
Fifth, we shall protect our rivers and our coasts with new measures of
control over industrial and human effluence.

There is an immense amount of work that needs to be done if we are to deal
effectively with this problem.

The central premise in Labour's approach to these problems is to accept that
community responsibility is essential if the quality of life is to be enhanced.
We believe that Tory philosophy - with its emphasis on private interests and
its opposition to collective organisation - is quite incapable of dealing with
the problems which will increasingly arise.

6. Caring for People

The greatest single achievement of the post-war Labour Government was its
creation of the best universal social security system and the first
comprehensive health service in the world. The greatest single
condemnation of Tory rule was the appalling neglect of this social
programme.

They left a desperate need for new investment and a considerable shortage of
staff. Hospital building was virtually neglected for the first ten years of Tory
Government. They cut the number of doctors in training and they imposed a
freeze on nurses' pay. The flat-rate national insurance contribution imposed a
regressive poll-tax on the lower-paid. Worst of all, no fundamental proposals
were made to abolish poverty in old age.

Labour's programme of action has therefore been as follows:

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

1. A substantial rise in all benefits.
2. More money for buildings and trained staff.
3. Structural reform of the old system.

Since the last full Tory year spending on health and social security is up over
70 per cent; wage-related short-term benefits and redundancy payments have
been introduced; a tremendous programme of hospital building is under way,
and a far-reaching Plan for National Superannuation has been incorporated
in a Bill.

Benefits

Three increases - the last in November 1969 - have substantially raised the
real level of retirement pensions. The earnings rule has been relaxed - and
for widows abolished. Sickness, unemployment, and other benefits have
been increased in line with pensions, and redundancy pay and earnings-
related short-term benefits begun.

The old National Assistance Board has been abolished. A more open and
humane Supplementary Benefits Commission provides entitlement as a
right. Three times the number of old people are now living independent lives
in flats of their own, with a warden on call; over 500 more old people's
homes have been built; and meals on wheels doubled.

Benefits for children have had a high priority. For the last eight Tory years,
no increases in family allowances were made. Labour has twice raised these
allowances - the value is now more than double - and has concentrated the
benefit on the poorer family by balancing tax allowances and cash benefits.

Health Services

Expenditure on hospital building has been more than doubled. Five times as
many health centres are now open. Local health and welfare expenditure as a
whole is now running at three times the level of just ten years ago.

The National Health Service will be developed by continued expansion of
training of doctors, nurses and other staff, by our great building programme,
and by changes in the administrative structure to bring unified Local Health
Authorities.

The Next Steps
1. The New Pensions Plan

The present national insurance scheme, in spite of the improvements which
Labour has made, cannot provide an adequate income for retirement. Flat-
rate contribution and benefits must inevitably be geared to the ability of the
lowest paid to enter into the insurance contract. As a result, those on average
and above average pay would always find a steep drop in their means upon
retirement.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 18 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

Labour's new Pension Plan will, therefore, incorporate radical concepts in
social security; earnings-related contributions will mean a reduction for
millions of lower paid workers. Benefits will be calculated in such a way as
to assist the industrial worker and the below-average earner; there will be
partnership with private occupational schemes, through which many will
want to add to their state pension; full equality for women; a widow will
receive the whole of her husband's pension; widows' pensions will be paid at
40; women will receive earnings-related sickness and unemployment benefit.

Labour's scheme is designed to abolish poverty in old age by enabling every
worker to qualify for a pension at a level where supplementary benefit is no
longer required. The wealth of the nation is increasing and those least able to
care for themselves - the aged, the sick, unemployed and the widow - have a
right to share in rising prosperity, and satisfy rising expectation. The Tories
were the first to misrepresent the scheme. Now they are pledged to destroy
It.

2. Disabled

As part of the new Act, we shall develop a new deal for the long-term sick
and disabled. There will be an earnings-related invalidity benefit, and a
constant attendance allowance for the very severely disabled, which for the
first time covers the non-earner, the wife and children.

3. Family Poverty

There is a continuing problem of poverty in low income families - a many-
sided problem of low wage industries, of disability and of special
difficulties. On all of these the Labour Government has acted to help, and we
will take steps to provide further social support. In the last two budgets we
have taken three million on low incomes out of taxation.

We shall review the present system of family allowances and income tax
child allowances.

On the special problem of the single-parent family, the Government has set
up a comprehensive study under the Finer Committee.

4. Health Service

We need to concentrate more resources m the health service on the needs of
the mentally handicapped, the mentally ill and elderly sick. Long stay
hospitals, particularly those for the mentally handicapped, have for far too
long been subjected to gross under-staffing and overcrowding, many of them
in obsolete buildings.

We have already dealt with some of the worst features of this social scandal

and have worked out our plans for providing to those long stay patients for
whom there is small chance of cure, the care they deserve.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 19 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

The new unitary structure of the health service and its close co-operation
with the new local authorities will help to ensure more effective joint
planning of hostels and homes and a better deployment of nurses and other
staffs.

7. A More Active Democracy

Strong economic policy and care and compassion in the social field must be
accompanied by a new drive both to infuse a democratic element into the
increasingly complex institutions which dominate our lives and to give
added protection and safeguards to the rights of individuals.

The priorities are clear. We have to make existing democratic institutions
more effective and we have to extend the democratic principle, in various
forms, into those institutions where democracy itself is still a stranger.

The machinery of government itself must be adapted to meet new demands
and democratic procedures must be extended into industry and the social
services.

Central Government and Parliament

Labour has begun the process of reform at the very heart of public decision
making - central government itself. Archaic House of Commons procedures
have been swept away, specialist Select Committees set up, and greatly
improved research and information facilities to help M.P.s work more
effectively.

The Government has introduced the instrument of the Green Paper to allow
wide public debate and consultation on public issues before the crucial
decisions are taken.

Under a Labour Government young people have been given full civil rights -
including the right to vote at 18.

Following the publication of the Fulton Report, reform of the Civil Service
is now going ahead. Our purpose is to achieve a broader base for
recruitment, more specialist skills, the abolition of the class structure, and
greater mobility between various branches of the service and with outside
occupations.

An Ombudsman was appointed in 1968 to investigate the citizens'
complaints against Government Departments. This office has already proved
its value, and we now intend to extend the principle to local government and
to the health service.

We cannot accept the situation in which the House of Lords can nullify
important decisions of the House of Commons and, with its delaying
powers, veto measures in the last year before an election. Proposals to secure
reform will therefore be brought forward.

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM
Devolution

In 1965 the Labour Government set up for the first time Economic Planning
Councils and Planning Boards for Wales, Scotland and the eight new
planning regions of England. These have proved to be effective instruments
to strengthen the Government's regional policies, and have given new
impetus to proposals for devolution. The Government therefore set up a
Commission on the Constitution which is now examining and receiving
evidence on these issues.

Wales

In Wales the Labour Government in 1964 set up the Welsh Office with the
Secretary of State a member of the Cabinet. The responsibilities of the
Welsh Office have recently been substantially increased.

The Government has published proposals for a new local authority structure
to provide improved local services. The evidence given by the Labour Party
to the Commission on the Constitution includes plans for an elected council
for Wales with extended powers. The Labour Party in Wales believes
strongly in the integration of the United Kingdom and rejects a policy of
separatism or a separate Parliament for Wales as being detrimental to the
true interests of the Principality.

The Welsh Language Act 1967 has given a new impetus to the use of Welsh
in public affairs. The Government will continue to encourage the growth of
Welsh or bilingual schools throughout Wales. Through its financial support
for the publication of books in Welsh for adults and through the expanding
services of the Welsh Arts Council, the Labour Government will continue its
efforts to support Welsh culture.

In its economic life, Wales has benefited significantly from the Government's
policy which has attracted more than 150 new firms to

Wales since 1964, which has secured for Wales the largest ever trunk road
programme and the highest number of houses ever built, which has halted
depopulation in Mid-Wales, has fostered the tourist industry and has for the
first time really tackled the problem of derelict land.

Scotland

The Labour Party in Scotland his welcomed any changes leading to more
effective Government which do not destroy the integration of the U.K. or
weaken Scotland's influence at Westminster. They too reject separatism and
also any separate legislative assembly.

Since 1964 Labour's separate legislation for Scotland has been accepted by
the U.K. Parliament

¢ The Countryside Commission

¢ The General Teaching Council

¢ The Social Work Act

¢ The First Stage of Feudal Tenure reform
¢ Security for Tenant Farmers, etc.

Much of that legislation has led the way for the rest of the country.

We shall now further these aims in our proposals for local government
reform based upon Wheatley. We shall complete our work of abolishing and
replacing the feudal system of land tenure. And we shall apply Scottish
solutions to Scottish problems.

Northern Ireland

Northern Ireland presents major problems. Fifty years of one-party Tory rule
have led to social tensions and lack of opportunities which erupted into
major disorders last summer. The Government has helped stabilise the
situation and has insisted on reforms being carried out in Northern Ireland
based on the practice and principle of nondiscrimination. In particular, it has
been agreed that the reform of local government in Ulster shall proceed and
that a Central Housing Authority shall be set up. British troops will remain
in Northern Ireland so long as they are needed.

The Downing St. Declaration of 19th August, 1969 signed by the Prime
Minister of the United Kingdom, and the Prime Minister of Northern
Ireland, reaffirmed that in all legislation and executive decisions of
Government every citizen of Northern Ireland is entitled to the same equality
of treatment and freedom from discrimination as obtains in the rest of the
United Kingdom, irrespective of political views or religion.

Local Government

We believe that the recent reports on local government present a great
opportunity for the transfer of administrative power from Westminster to the
localities. Larger and stronger local authorities will mean better planning,
more efficiency, stronger councils and improved quality in local democracy
and local services.

Legislation will be brought forward in the next Parliament to set up new
authorities, to abolish the post of alderman and to give added power to
elected representatives. We shall also encourage the setting up of Local
Councils to give people a greater say in local problems.

Health Service

Hand in hand with the reform of local government we propose a new
administrative structure for the Health Service. We shall bring together the
now separate hospital service, the general practitioner service and the local
authority health services. The old tripartite structure will go, and be replaced

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

by area Health Authorities which will allow for greater involvement in its
administration of local representatives and those who operate the service.

Schools

The Government's major White Paper on Education will include proposals to
involve parents, teachers and the wider community more directly in the
management of the education system.

Industrial Democracy

But political democracy is of limited value unless it is underpinned by
industrial democracy. If we are to have greater industrial harmony, we must
involve the worker through his union more closely in the decisions which
affect his working life and eliminate the grievances that are the causes of
many strikes.

That is why Labour has produced a charter of good industrial relations on
which it intends to legislate.

This will:

¢ Overhaul negotiating and disputes procedures

¢ Give safeguards against unfair dismissal

e Make recognition a legal right for trade unions

e Ensure greater disclosure of information to workers' representatives

¢ Encourage the rationalisation of trade union structures

e Enable unions and employers to negotiate legally binding agreements
where they expressly indicate their desire to do so.

Britain's publicly owned industries are already experimenting in new
worker/manager relationships and new ways of securing workers'
representation on their boards of management. A Labour Government will
encourage similar experiments in private industry.

We shall also consider further the structure of the limited liability company
with a view to making it more accountable to its employees and the
community.

Law and Justice

It is a first duty of government to protect the citizen against violence,
intimidation and crime. The Government will vigorously pursue the fight
against vandals and law breakers. But the campaign for law and order must
be linked to liberty and justice in a civilised society. Nothing could be more
cynical than the current attempts by our opponents to exploit for Party
political ends the issue of crime and law enforcement.

Crime

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

The streets of our cities are as safe today as those in any throughout the
world. They must remain so. Labour has reorganised the police forces in this
country and a record sum is being spent on equipment. The number of police
is higher than ever before. The Gaming Act of 1968 purged gambling of its
criminal elements, cut excessive profits, and checked the proliferation of
gaming machines.

Equally important are our achievements in obtaining penal reform, in
transforming our approach to the young offender, in democratising the
magistrates' bench, and in our approach to rehabilitating the prisoner. This is
an exceedingly difficult task while so many of our prisons are a century old
and are gravely overcrowded; but it must be persisted in patiently, not only
for the sake of the prisoner himself, but because his return to a decent way of
life and to productive work obviously benefits society as a whole.

Law Reform

Britain's system of justice is renowned throughout the world, but many of
our laws need up-dating and the administration of justice is severely over-
stretched. Labour's Law Commissions will continue with their work for
systematic codification of criminal law, repeal of old Acts, simplification of
the statute book and reform of the courts. It is also our aim to enable the
courts to handle the increasing volume of work.

Access to the Law

We have recently extended the legal aid scheme and it is our intention to
ensure that people with modest means can obtain legal advice and be
properly represented in the courts of law.

Race Relations

With the rate of immigration under firm control and much lower than in past
years, we shall be able still more to concentrate our resources in the major
task of securing good race relations. The Urban Programme includes help to
areas of high immigrant population, where special social needs exist. The
Race Relations Act has outlawed incitement to racial hatred and
discrimination in housing, employment and credit facilities. The Community
Relations Commission, with the local authorities and other voluntary bodies,
is dealing with the longer-term problem of community living.

We now propose to review the law relating to citizenship and to give the
Race Relations Board powers of discretion in taking up complaints.

Broadcasting
Broadcasting has a major role to play in an informed democracy.

The greatest danger in communications is the danger of growing

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 24 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

concentration of private ownership, and the parallel danger of domination by
commercial values. In broadcasting the Government has firmly resisted the
commercial lobby's pleas for private radio. A network of local radio stations
has instead been created - responsible to the community and co-ordinated by
the B.B.C.

The Government has decided to establish a high-powered Committee of
Enquiry to report on the Future of Broadcasting, in time for the basic
decisions which have to be taken in 1975.

A Healthy Democracy

When individuals have a satisfying and rewarding job, and when they have
then satisfied basic needs for food and shelter and a pleasant environment,
we believe that many will wish to devote more time and interest to the
collective problems of the community. It is this, in recent years, which has
led to calls for greater devolution, participation in decision-making and
reform of democratic structures.

The proposals we have set out above will ensure a thorough-going reform of
government machinery, together with an increase in democratic decision-
taking in the community; the school, the hospital and workplace. We believe
that this is the reform people wish - an opportunity to influence decisions on
those things which interest and affect them most. It calls for a continuing
change in the relationship between government and governed, and we gladly
accept the challenge of making sure that the reforms go through.

We also want people to assume greater responsibility themselves. The future
of this country depends as much on how people use the power they have as
on the action government may take.

8. Britain in the World Community

Labour's fundamental and historic changes in Britain's defence and foreign
policy have given Britain a more credible and realistic position in world
affairs than we ever enjoyed under the last Tory administration. In the last
five years Labour has:

e Saved £3,000 million on Tory defence plans

e Planned a further saving of £2,000 million by 1972

e Ended our commitments East of Suez

e Increased our support for the U.N.

¢ Strengthened the Commonwealth

¢ Improved Forces pay and conditions

¢ Given independence to nine former colonies

¢ Observed the U.N. arms ban on South Africa

¢ Brought increased support to collective security in Europe and to the
search for European détente

¢ Underlined our desire to play a full part in the future political and
economic development of our continent.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 25 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM
Peace and Security

The steady work of Labour's Ministers of Disarmament has achieved real
progress. They played a large part in securing agreement on the Nuclear
Non-proliferation Treaty which now, signed and ratified by the required
number of nations, has come into force. One consequence of this Treaty has
been that America and Russia are now engaged in serious discussion on
Strategic Arms Limitation; and all men of good will will wish these talks
success.

Labour's Ministers were also active in establishing a Nuclear Free Zone in
Latin America. The next tasks - on which Ministers are already at work - are
these:

(a) Acomprehensive ban on the testing of nuclear weapons
(b) Anew international agreement to outlaw biological weapons

(c) An agreement to prevent the depths of the sea from being used for
warlike purposes.

In the world as it is today, Britain must maintain her defences and her firm
commitment to NATO. It is true - and it is a truly Socialist shift in priorities -
that we now spend more on education than on defence, and that in the near
future the health and welfare service expenditure will also exceed defence
spending. Yet, because of our shrewd and sensible reduction in
commitments, with Labour, the armed forces are better paid, better equipped
and more effective in NATO than ever before. More than that, in contrast to
the hundreds of millions of pounds wasted on costly prestige projects under
the Tories, Labour's defence planning gives the taxpayer value for money.

Labour is determined that NATO shall not be merely a defensive alliance: it
must work positively for a relaxation of tension and reduction of forces.
Some progress is already being made. Herr Willy Brandt, Socialist
Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, is engaged in talks with
Russia, Poland and East Germany. The British Labour Government fully
supports his efforts. Our Government, together with America, France and
Russia, is seeking to reduce the occasions for conflict and tension in Berlin.

The Government believes that the members of NATO should work towards a
well-prepared conference on European Security, in which balanced reduction
of forces and the key problems now creating tension in Europe could be
discussed. The Government has just taken a new initiative for multilateral
explanatory talks with the Warsaw Pact countries with a view to finding a
basis for wide-ranging negotiations on European security and a relaxation of
tension.

In two areas - Indo-China and the Middle East - there is bitter conflict, full
of danger for the peace of the world. Labour believes that no purely military
solution is possible in either of these areas. A lasting settlement in Indo-
China must be based on the Geneva agreements and the withdrawal of all

13/06/2024, 13:12

foreign troops; a lasting settlement in the Middle East on the British
sponsored Security Council resolution of November 1967. It is on these
foundations that a Labour Government will work.

The United Nations

Support for the U.N. continues to be the cornerstone of Labour's foreign
policy. Britain is the only one of more than 100 member countries which is
represented at the U.N. by a senior Minister, with direct access to the Prime
Minister. Further examination will be given to the establishing of a
permanent U.N. peace-keeping force and further efforts must be made to
guarantee the U.N. a firm financial basis.

The Fight Against World Poverty

The Ministry of Overseas Development, which Labour set up, has meant that
aid is better co-ordinated and directed and thus more effective, than ever
before. The improved economic climate will enable us to make progress.

In the next five years Labour is to increase our aid programme by about one-
third, from £219 millions in 69/70 to £300 millions in 73/74.

Labour will seek to devote 1 per cent of our Gross National Product to aid
the developing world by 1975 and to achieve an official flow of aid of 0.7
per cent of GNP during the Second Development Decade - this accepts the
target set by the Pearson Commission.

Multilateral agencies will receive a larger proportion of total aid flow and
more resources will be devoted to rural and co-operative development and
population planning.

Racial Conflict

The division of the world along racial lines presents a major threat to peace
during the coming decade. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Southern
Africa, where the odious doctrine of Apartheid continues to flourish.

Official Tory Party policy already commits a future Conservative
Government to:

(a) Sell arms to South Africa
(b) Negotiate with the Smith regime on Rhodesia

Labour made every effort possible to bring about an honourable settlement
in Rhodesia consistent with the six principles. The illegal Rhodesian regime
slammed the door by introducing an Apartheid-type republican constitution.
Labour will maintain sanctions against the illegal regime and negotiate no
settlement that does not guarantee unimpeded progress to majority rule. A
Labour Government will continue to comply with the United Nations ban on

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 27 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12
arms to South Africa.
The Commonwealth

In the building of racial harmony and the fight against poverty the
Commonwealth can play a unique and expanding role in building bridges
between all races, between rich and poor, and help maintain the co-operation
and understanding between nations which makes it a force for peace. The
Government will encourage and support an expansion of the technical
assistance and co-ordinating functions of the Commonwealth Secretariat.

Throughout the sixties Tory journalists and politicians decried the usefulness
of the Commonwealth link. With Labour the Commonwealth has been
revitalised, with its own secretariat and Secretary General providing a wide
range of services and co-ordinating functions for member states.

The World Economy

Today either the scale of initial investment or the size of market required to
ensure viability demands international co-operation for new developments
such as space communications or aircraft production.

Through the Ministry of Technology, established by Labour in 1964, such
co-operation is fostered not only with the U.S.A. and Western Europe but
also with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

In the coming decade we shall develop closer technological relations with
India and other countries. Trading and technological links may also play a
part in helping to bring China into the community of nations. Labour still

believes that China should be a member. of the United Nations.

The pressures put on individual national currencies, the problems presented
by major international companies crossing frontiers as if they did not exist
and transferring know-how and resources with great ease, the need for
international action to tackle problems of our environment such as oil
pollution, the need to encourage a greater volume of world trade, are all
problems which can only be solved by international co-operation.

Some of these problems will require world-wide action by agencies of the
United Nations. Others will best be dealt with by 'regional cooperation. In
Europe, Britain already is part of the European Free Trade Association.

We have applied for membership of the European Economic Community
and negotiations are due to start in a few weeks' time. These will be pressed
with determination with the purpose of joining an enlarged community
provided that British and essential Commonwealth interests can be
safeguarded.

This year, unlike 1961-1963, Britain will be negotiating from a position of
economic strength. Britain's strength means that we shall be able to meet the
challenges and realise the opportunities of joining an enlarged Community.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1970/1970-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 28 of 29

1970 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:12

But it means, too, that if satisfactory terms cannot be secured in the
negotiations Britain will be able to stand on her own 'feet outside the
Community.

Unlike the Conservatives, a Labour Government will not be prepared to pay
part of the price of entry in advance of entry and irrespective of entry by
accepting the policies, on which the Conservative Party are insisting, for
levies on food prices, the scrapping of our food subsidies and the
introduction of the Value-Added Tax.

A Role in the World

The Tory leaders have, in the last six years, revealed their chronic inability
to come to terms with the modern world. They have constantly attacked
defence saving (everything from the TSR2 to the Territorials). Their constant
disparagement of both the U.N. and the Commonwealth and their wish for
closer links with white Southern Africa can leave little doubt that Tory
policy would exacerbate the tensions between the rich white and poor black
nations in the world.

By contrast Labour offers a more responsible and credible role for Britain in
world affairs. A role which ensures that we make our full contribution to the
development of Europe and the relaxation of East/West tensions and which
at the same time strengthens the U.N. and the Commonwealth and ensures
that we play an increasingly important role in the fight against polarisation
along racial lines and in the battle to end world poverty.

We never thought, or promised, that the job of ending poverty, at home as
well as abroad, would be an easy one. But to do this job is part of our
dedication as Socialists.

We have begun to do it, in partnership between people and government. On

Thursday, 18 June, the people will be able to give Labour the mandate we
need to go forward.

October 1974 Labour Party
Manifesto

 

Britain Will Win With Labour

Foreward

by The Rt. Hon. Harold Wilson, OBE, FRS, MP

In February we put before the British people our Manifesto, 'Labour's Way
out of the Crisis’.

It was a programme for getting Britain back to work, for overcoming what
was universally acknowledged to be the gravest economic crisis Britain had
faced since the war. A programme to be carried out by a Government of all
the people working together.

Labour formed the Government, got Britain back to work and showed our
determination to fulfil the programme which we had put before the people.
No post war British Government has achieved more in six months.

But at every turn we have found ourselves faced in Parliament by a majority
which could, and did, coalesce to frustrate the policies we had put before the
nation. What is still more serious has been the widespread expectation of an

inevitable and early General Election, which created uncertainty in industry

and the other institutions of our British society.

Soon the people must decide on the Government to whom they want to
entrust the future of themselves and their families for the next five years.

They will judge each Party on its record in office, when it had the
responsibility: on its record in honouring the pledges it had made to the
country. On its willingness to undertake measures which would enlist the
support and enthusiasm of our people in fighting the economic crisis.

They will judge on the policies which each Party puts forward, asking
themselves which Party can best be trusted to make a reality of those
policies.

They will judge not only on policies and records, but on the calibre and
experience of the men and women who will be responsible for carrying out
those policies. On their compassion and the understanding of the problems
of ordinary families: on their determination to govern for, and with the

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Oct/1974-oct-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 21

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

sanction of, all of the people.

In February the country rejected, as we had urged, policies of confrontation
and conflict and 'fight to a finish' philosophies. We put before the country the
policy of the Social Contract.

We have shown that as a Government we are prepared to take the decisions
that are needed to achieve economic and social justice without which this
country can never unite.

The policies we have followed over the past six months, the policies which
the next Labour Government will follow, are policies to strengthen the
Social Contract.

It is not simply, or narrowly, an understanding about wages. It is about
justice, equality, about concern for and protection of the lower paid, the
needy, the pensioner and the handicapped in our society.

It is about fairness between one man and another, and between men and
women. It is about economic justice between individuals and between
regions. It is about co-operation and conciliation, not conflict and
confrontation.

But more than that. What we as democratic socialists maintain is that when
the going is toughest it is more than ever necessary to base our policies on

social justice, to protect the weak, the poor, the disabled, to help those least
able to help themselves, and to maintain and improve their living standards.

Other Parties which do not believe in fair shares deny themselves the right to
call for equal sacrifices.

Injustice is the enemy of national unity.

The crisis we are facing demands a still greater emphasis on social justice, as
well as economic justice, than at any time in this generation.

That is the inspiration underlying the policies set out in this Manifesto.

It carries forward the programme we set out in February. It builds on our
achievements in fulfilling, in six months, so much of that programme. It sets
out in much more detail the policies we then announced, proposals which
have now been firmly rooted in our experience in government, and
responsibly costed against the resources which as a nation we can afford.

This Manifesto, which is inspired by the idealism which has created our
Movement, is now put before the country on the basis of the realism
deriving from experience. It sets out what in our view is the only way to
enable Britain to win through the crisis we now all face, and to share
together, as one people, the fruits of the success we are determined to
achieve.

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

Britain faces its most dangerous crisis since the war. The Labour Party
makes no attempt to disguise this. On the contrary, at the time of the
February election, we took the British people into our confidence and shared
the realities of our daunting problems. We inherited a three-day week, unlit
streets, unheated homes and work-places. And worst of all, a wounded
national economy, made all the more serious by the socially divisive policies
of the previous Conservative Government, with its deliberate confrontation
with the organised working people of our country. The Conservatives
created a society in which people who made money were more honoured
than men and women who earned their wages.

This crisis for our country was all the more desperate because it was set in
the context of a continuing world upheaval. Most of the world is still
staggering from the enormous increases in the price of oil - the most
important basic commodity in modern industrial and agricultural society.

We come with confidence before the public to ask for a strong mandate for
the policies drawn from ‘Labour's Programme for Britain’ set out in our
February manifesto, some of which have been spelled out in greater detail in
White Papers published by the Government. No Government can get Britain
moving by itself. A democratic Government must reflect the views of the
people. And the people who vote for the Government must give their share
of endeavour and concern - as well as their votes. But a Government can
only ask these efforts from the men and women of this country if they can
confidently see a vision of a fair and just society. Why should a coal miner
dig extra coal for a few pounds more while he has seen property speculators
grow wealthy looking at empty office blocks? A strong new Labour
Government, with the agreement and co-operation of the British people, can
make constructive, but not painless progress towards building a fair society.

This election is inevitable since no clear majority emerged in February.
Despite its minority position the Labour Government have made a good
start. Now we ask for the return of a Labour Government, with a working
majority, so that we can continue to tackle the great problems facing Britain.
We have to come to the men and women of our country and ask for their
mandate for industrial and social reconstruction. We need national support
for a steady will for a new society. In fact we are asking your help to carry
through policies which will work for international peace and co-operation
and at the same time create at home effective measures of economic and
social reconstruction.

It is only with a sense of unity that we shall win through. But we cannot
expect this from a Conservative Government - nor from any Conservative-
Liberal coalition. The Tory Party is, by its own statements, deeply divided
about what policies to put before the electorate. Neither the Tories nor a
Conservative-Liberal coalition can bring a united and decisive programme of
solution to contemporary problems.

Why can't we accept the idea of a coalition to meet the nation's crisis?

Because what our country needs in this crisis is a government with a clear-
cut understanding of the nation's problems and the ability to decide quickly

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Oct/1974-oct-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 21

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

and effectively how to deal with them. A coalition government, by its very
nature, tends to trim its policies and fudge its decisions, and in present
circumstances that just won't do. If we believe, as we must, in our own
independent political philosophies, there is no meeting point between us and
those with quite different philosophies, and it would be a cruel farce to
suggest that the future of the country would be helped by shuffling,
compromising administration.

We want to be frank with you. The regeneration of our economy isn't going
to be easy, even with a Labour Government. The next two or three years are
going to be difficult for us all. There will be no easy times and no easy
pickings for anyone.

We put forward in this manifesto a list of improvements we want to make in
society. We put them forward in good faith; but many of them cost money,
and we understand perfectly well - and we believe you will, too - that the
timing of them will depend on how quickly and how completely we get on
top of the economic problems.

But Labour doesn't go along with the prophets of doom and gloom. We have
great confidence in the British people. If you give us your full backing over
the difficult two or three years ahead we shall weather the storm and get
back on the right course.

Promises and Priorities

The Labour Government has kept the promises made at the election in
February. From the day we took office we acted. We increased pensions to
&pound;10 and &pound;16. We froze rents. We gave security to people who
live in furnished tenancies. We repealed the divisive Industrial Relations Act
and we replaced confrontation by conciliation. We restrained the rise in the
cost of living by our subsidies on essential foods and price controls. We gave
loans to the building societies to help house-buyers - who would otherwise
have faced mortgage rates of 13%. We allocated more money to local
councils to build or buy homes.

The Government have published plans for the public owner ship of
development land which will get rid of the major inflationary element in the
cost of building; for public control and participation in North Sea oil; for
greater accountability and the extension of public ownership in industry; for
beginning the redistribution of wealth by new taxation on the better-off -
while at the other end of the scale a million and a half people have been
taken out of liability to any income tax. We have published radical and
detailed proposals for pensions and for bringing help as of right to the
disabled. New rights for women and our determination to implement equal
pay have been announced. And we have begun in earnest the promised
renegotiation of the Conservatives' disadvantageous terms of entry to the
Common Market.

As at the last election, we are not making any promises which we cannot

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Oct/1974-oct-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 21

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

keep. We do not believe in electoral bribes - these are an insult to the
intelligence and realism of the public. The priorities we set out here are part
of a programme for a five year term of office. Much of what we want to do
will take longer because of all the heavy spade-work which has to be done to
create the economic strength on which all else depends.

The Social Contract

At the heart of this manifesto and our programme to save the nation lies the
Social Contract between the Labour Government and the trade unions, an
idea derided by our enemies, but certain to become widely accepted by those
who genuinely believe in government by consent - that is, in the democratic
process itself as opposed to the authoritarian and bureaucratic system of
wage control imposed by the Heath Government and removed by Labour.

The Social Contract is no mere paper agreement approved by politicians and
trade unions. It is not concerned solely or even primarily with wages. It
covers the whole range of national policies. It is the agreed basis upon which
the Labour Party and the trade unions define their common purpose.

Labour describes - as we did in our February manifesto at the time of the last
election and as we do again at this one - the firm and detailed commitments
which will be fulfilled in the field of social policy, in the fairer sharing of the
nation's wealth, in the determination to restore and sustain full employment.
The unions in response confirm how they will seek to exercise the newly
restored right of free collective bargaining. Naturally the trade unions see
their clearest loyalty to their own members. But the Social Contract is their
free acknowledgment that they have other loyalties - to the members of other
unions too, to pensioners, to the lower-paid, to invalids, to the community as
a whole.

It is these wide-ranging hopes and obligations which the General Council of
the TUC described in its declaration of June 26 and which were
overwhelmingly approved by the Congress on September 4. This is the
Social Contract which can re-establish faith in the working of Britain' 5
democracy in the years ahead.

Inflation

The first priority must be a determined attack on inflation and the appalling
overseas deficit which we inherited. Inflation is a World-Wide problem and
there are no easy answers, but for us the crisis was made worse than it need
have been because of the financial disasters Labour inherited from the Tory
Government.

Inflation is one of the greatest economic perils we face. It afflicts all the
countries of the world. From Japan to France, from the United States to
Britain, prices are rising at between 15% and 25% a year. Oil, the lifeblood
of industry and transport, costs four times what it did a year ago; wheat,

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Oct/1974-oct-labour-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 13:25

Page 5 of 21

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

feedgrains, sugar and other imported foodstuffs, nearly double. These
powerful inflationary forces cannot be wholly mastered by any single
government acting alone. It will require international co-operation both to
curb inflation and to avoid a slump.

But there are things the Government can - and must - do. We were elected
last February to govern a Britain that had been greatly weakened by the
policies of the Conservatives. The Heath Government allowed a huge deficit
to accumulate on our balance of payments, even before the oil price rises hit
us. It borrowed and printed hundreds of millions of pounds at home, fuelling
the fires of inflation; it let our scarce resources go into office blocks, luxury
flats and property speculation, at a time that Britain badly needed investment
in industry and in housing for rent. Britain, in February 1974, was in bad
shape to withstand the economic hurricane.

We reject entirely the policy put forward by some Tories of fighting inflation
by throwing millions of people out of work.

We are doing everything within our power to curb inflation. And where
rising prices are outside our control, as with imports of oil and raw materials,
we have sought to protect the least well-off, the pensioner and the low-paid,
for whom inflation is not just a worry but a nightmare.

We have:

¢ Stopped printing money to finance unnecessary expenditure;

¢ Cut VAT from 10% to 8%;

¢ Reduced gross profit margins by 10% and agreed with the food trade
to concentrate profit cuts on essential foods;

¢ Frozen rents and stabilised mortgage rates;

e Subsidised basic foods - bread, flour, butter, cheese, milk and tea- in a
way that gives most benefit to the least well-off;

¢ Taken powers to set maximum prices for subsidised foods; laid down
a minimum of three months between price rises, and stopped' the
‘sticky label’ trick;

¢ Set up a National Consumer Agency, backed by a net work of local
consumer advice centres.

We shall:

money;

Oil Crisis

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

We shall continue to give high priority to our overseas trade. We have to. At
the centre of our national and international crisis is the enormous increase in
oil prices which is costing this country an extra £2,500 million this year.

We must get rid of the non-oil deficit we inherited from the previous Tory
Government, while tackling in co-operation with other countries also
affected, the balance of payments and currency problems created by the
fourfold increase in the price of oil.

Agriculture

Labour will encourage the maximum economic production of food by the
farming and fishing industries. We inherited from the Tories an extremely
grave crisis in the agricultural industry - with extremely high feed costs, and
the cereals sector succeeding at the expense of the livestock sector.

A Tory Government negotiated entry into the EEC and removed the long-
term guarantees to the livestock industry. The Intervention System of the
Common Agricultural Policy has not worked. Labour insists that there must
be a new approach, with a clear emphasis on national aids, and that we must
be able to provide suitable guarantees to our farmers.

We have already taken urgent action:

¢ A special subsidy on pigs, representing an injection of £30 million to
the UK pig industry;

¢ The near doubling of the calf subsidy, providing an extra £35 million a
year.

¢ Anew beef premium, an arrangement which gives another £40 million
to the producers;

¢ The restoration of the lime subsidy which was abolished by the Tories
- worth £5 million a year.

e A temporary subsidy on the oil used for heating glass- houses - which
injects a further £7 million into the horticultural industry.

We will, in addition, introduce in the very near future, considerable help to
the dairy industry.

Our long-term objective is to secure the expansion of the industry. We intend
to continue our discussions with the Farmers' Unions - and the agricultural
workers - with the dual objective of drawing up a meaningful longer term
expansion and of determining the means whereby this can be achieved.

Employment and Expansion

In the long run, a nation, like a family, can only live on what it earns. If we
want to maintain our standard of living and protect people's jobs and give a
boost to our deprived regions, we must get industry to produce more and
export more.

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

This is going to demand some radical changes. The Tories and their Aims of
Industry friends say we ought to leave things as they are. But things as they
are consist of lower productivity, less competitiveness and much lower
investment than other countries. If we leave things as they are we shall go
on, as we have done for years, slipping behind other nations. The industrial
sector of our economy is suffering from grave and chronic debilitation and
that sort of illness cannot be cured with a couple of aspirin tablets. We need
a new deal.

The present Labour Government has made a start on this task. It has
stemmed the runaway rise in interest rates. It has doubled the Regional
Employment Premium and listed new development and special development
areas for extra help. Our exports are doing well, and outside the inflated oil
bill, we are paying for more of our imports with exports.

But there is still a long way to go. In our February manifesto we put forward
proposals for an extension of the public sector where it is most needed, and
for a new relationship between the Government and the large privately-
owned companies which will do much to regenerate British industry.

We stand firmly by those proposals. The Government has published a White
Paper describing how they will work:

1. Anew and urgent Industry Act will provide for a system of Planning
Agreements between the Government and key companies to ensure
that the plans of those companies are in harmony with national needs
and objectives and that Government financial assistance is deployed
where it will be most effectively used. Wherever we give direct aid to
a company out of public funds we shall reserve the right to take a
proportionate share of the ownership of the company; and wherever
possible this public support will be channelled through the Planning
Agreements System.

2. In addition to our plans for taking into common ownership the land
required for development, we shall substantially extend public
enterprise by taking over mineral rights. We shall also take ports, ship-
building, ship-repairing and marine engineering, and the aircraft
industries into public ownership and control. We shall not confine the
extension of the public sector to loss-making and subsidised
industries. We shall set up a National Enterprise Board to administer
publicly-owned share-holdings: to extend public ownership into
profitable manufacturing industry by acquisitions, partly or wholly, of
individual firms; to stimulate investment; to create employment in
areas of high unemployment; to encourage industrial democracy; to
promote industrial efficiency; to increase exports and reduce our
dependence on imports; to combat private monopoly; and to prevent
British industries from passing into unacceptable foreign control.

We do not accept the negative policies adopted by the previous Tory
Government towards the nationalised industries. We shall restore to our
public enterprises the assets and licences which the Tory Government took
away from them, and will encourage and help them diversify into new

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Oct/1974-oct-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 21

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

industries. We shall bring forward early proposals to ensure that banking and
insurance make a better contribution to the national economy.

Regional development will be further encouraged by new public enterprise,
by assistance to private industry on a selective basis, and new Regional
Planning Machinery, along the lines set out in 'Labour's Programme 1973'.
We will set up Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies. Moreover, the
revenues from the North Sea and Celtic Sea oil will help us to improve
employment in Scotland, Wales and the English regions in need of
development.

We shall transform the existing Manpower Services Commission into a
powerful body, responsible for the development and execution of a
comprehensive manpower policy. Redundant workers must have an
automatic right to retraining, with redundancy leading not to unemployment,
but to retraining and job changing.

Energy

The discovery of oil off our shores dramatically changes not only the
country's energy prospects, but our whole economic future. Because its
importance cannot be over-estimated it is essential that its development
should be under public control in the interests of the whole community, and
with regard to the future. The Labour Government will:-

Take majority participation in all future oil licences and negotiate to achieve
majority state participation in existing licences.

Set up a British National Oil Corporation to. enable the Government to
exercise participation rights; to play an active role in the future development,
exploration and exploitation of offshore oil; and to engage in the refining and
the distribution of oil. Its headquarters will be in Scotland.

Impose a substantial extra tax on the oil companies' profits from the North
Sea - and plug the loopholes in existing taxation.

Take new powers to control the pace of depletion, pipelines, exploration and
development - and to protect the environment; and nationalise the land
needed for the oil platform construction sites.

Set up new Development Agencies in Scotland and in Wales - financed by
the United Kingdom exchequer - with extra funds to reflect the revenue from
offshore oil.

After years of Tory indecision Labour has - within a few months - laid the
foundation for a coherent energy policy involving coal, gas, nuclear power
and electricity as well as oil. We have agreed an additional investment of
£600 million for the coal mines. We have backed British technology with a
programme of British reactors for the next generation of our power stations.

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

Industrial Relations

We promised to repeal the Tory Industrial Relations Act and this promise has
been fulfilled. The last minute amendments inserted into our Trade Union
and Labour Relations Act, by the coalition of Tories, Liberals and the Lords,
will be removed in the first session of the new Parliament.

But the repeal of the Tory Act was only the first step. Our aim is to make
industry democratic - to develop joint control and action by management and
workers across the whole range of industry, commerce and the public
services.

This objective involves strong trade union organisation and widening the
scope of collective bargaining. In addition, however, it will mean the
provision of new rights for workers through changes in company law.

First, We will introduce an Employment Protection Bill - to provide
extensive new rights for workers covering such issues as union membership,
apprentices' training and conditions, the guaranteed week, maternity leave,
safeguards on redundancy and employers’ bankruptcy, to give new rights to
unions in collective bargaining, including new safeguards for peaceful
picketing, to reform the Wages Councils and establish a key role for the new
Conciliation and Arbitration Service in helping to get rid of low pay.

Second, we will introduce new legislation to help forward our plans for a
radical extension of industrial democracy in both the private and public
sectors. This will involve major changes in company law and in the statutes
which govern the nationalised industries and the public services.

Measures will also be taken to tackle the evils created by private
employment agencies and to deal with abuses of labour-only contracting.

Social Justice

We believe that men and women will respond to difficult challenges if there
is a sense of underlying fairness in society.

Labour believes, for instance, that taxation must be used to achieve a major
redistribution of both wealth and income. The March Budget took 1
million men and women out of income tax altogether and concentrated tax
increases on the better off. It also blocked dozens of tax loopholes and
announced that a new Capital Transfers Tax would operate from the date of
the Budget.

The next Labour Government will introduce an annual tax on wealth above
£100,000. We will also legislate for the introduction of the Capital Transfers
Tax - which will, for the first time this century, make the Estate Duty an
effective tax on inherited wealth. Labour will also offer retired people and
young couples saving for a home a form of National Savings the value of
which will be guaranteed against inflation.

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

Social Security

The Labour Government's first step was to increase pensions to £10 fora
single person and £16 for a married couple: a record increase in record time.
Corresponding increases for widows, invalids and others on supplementary
benefit have been enacted. This is a real increase which more than
compensates for the rise in prices.

The Labour Government has already committed itself by law to maintain
and improve the real gain for existing pensioners by reviewing pensions and
other benefits regularly and by linking future increases to the rise in wages
and not just prices.

The Labour Government will:

Pay another £10 Christmas bonus this year to those who have retired and
this time will include invalidity pensioners and those receiving attendance
allowances, unemployability supplements or widows' benefits.

Replace the unjust Tory pension scheme with our recently announced long-
term plan for adequate earnings-related pensions for everyone, fully
protected against inflation. This will free future pensioners from the need for
means-tested assistance; give equality of treatment to women; include
invalidity pensioners; and give special help to the older workers and the low-
paid.

Attack family poverty, by increasing family allowances and extending them
to the first child through a new scheme of child credits payable to the
mother. We are also examining other ways of helping one-parent families.

Help disabled people who are outside the National Insurance scheme
through a new non-contributory benefit for those of working age and for
disabled housewives. We shall introduce an Invalid Care Allowance for
those who give up their jobs to look after a severely disabled relative and a
new mobility allowance for severely disabled people Whether or not they
can drive a car.

The National Health Service

Labour created the National Health Service and is deter mined to defend it.
Immense damage has been done to it by Tory cuts in public expenditure, by
the Tory Government's policy or rigid pay control and by the upheaval of
Tory reorganisation on undemocratic lines. Labour has already injected more
money into the Service; published proposals for greater democratic
participation in its running and above all, taken steps to end the exploitation
of nurses and other workers in the Service and to see that at last they receive
the rewards they so richly deserve.

Labour has already relieved women over 60 and children under 16 from
prescription charges and strengthened provision for dental care under the
National Health Service by freezing the level of dental charges for patients

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Oct/1974-oct-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 21

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

while increasing dentists' fees. Labour has reversed the Tory proposal to
impose charges on Family Planning.

It has started its attack on queue-jumping by increasing the charge for
private pay beds in National Health Service hospitals and is now working
out a scheme for phasing private beds out of these hospitals.

The Labour Government will reduce regional inequality of standards; put the
emphasis on prevention and primary care and give a clear priority to
spending on services for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped. It will
continue the progressive elimination of prescription charges and phase out
private pay beds from National Health Service hospitals.

The Right to Education

The Labour Party believes that full opportunities for the education of our
children, our young people and students of all ages are an essential part of a
fair society and indispensable to the social contract. We have already asked
local authorities to submit plans for comprehensive education by the end of
the year, increased provision for nursery education and raised students'
grants by 25%. The Labour Government realises the problems of many of
our teachers and an independent inquiry has been set up into their pay. We
have made an additional £1 1.8 million available to supplement teachers' pay
in difficult areas and increased the school building programme we inherited.
We have provided funds for new classes for adults who cannot read.

As in all our plans, economic restraints are bound to influence timing. But
the next Labour Government will:

e End the II plus and other forms of selection for secondary education.
Continue to give priority to nursery school and day care provision,
full-time and part-time.

¢ Stop the present system of Direct Grant Schools and withdraw tax
relief and charitable status from Public Schools, as a first step towards
our long-term aim of phasing out fee paying in schools.

¢ Continue to move towards a fairer system of student grants.

e Provide increased opportunities for further education and training,
including compulsory paid day release, especially for young people
who leave school early.

¢ Legislate for an annual review and an annual report to Parliament on
youth services.

Labour appointed the first ever Minister of Sport and Recreation and the first
ever Minister for the Arts. We removed the museum charges introduced by
the Tory Government, and we allocated greater resources to the Arts Council
than ever before. We shall bring forward proposals to make the Arts Council
more democratic and representative of people in the arts and in
entertainment. We will continue to develop and improve the facilities for
sport and leisure for all our citizens.

We will support the further development of the Open University, which was

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

founded by a Labour Government and which has enriched the lives of
thousands of people of all ages.

Our Homes, Our Land, Our Environment

Everybody is entitled to a decent home at a price they can afford. This
cannot be achieved in a free-for-all market, which has resulted in
homelessness, over-crowding and squalor for thousands of our people. We
have in a few months:

¢ given an extra £350m for councils to build more new houses and buy
existing housing;

¢ given a £500m loan to Building Societies to keep mortgage rates
down, and to make more mortgages available;

¢ introduced a rent freeze for both council and private tenants;

¢ passed a Rent Act to give security of tenure to furnished tenants of
absentee landlords;

¢ legislated for the creation of Housing Action Areas and against the
abuse of improvement grants;

¢ introduced a Bill to demolish the Tory Housing Finance Act.

The Labour Government will take into public ownership land required for
development, redevelopment and improvement. These proposals do not
apply to owner-occupiers, whose homes and gardens will be safeguarded.
But the public ownership by local authorities of necessary land is essential to
sensible and comprehensive planning both in our towns and in the
countryside. The land will be paid for at existing use value and the
expensive disgrace of land speculation will be ended.

The next Labour Government will:

¢ help home-buyers through a new National Housing Finance Agency to
assist first-time buyers and to stabilise mortgage lending. Local
councils' lending will be expanded so that they can play a major part
in helping house purchasers and keep down costs by supplying unified
services for estate agency, surveying, conveyancing and mortgages;

¢ restore to local authorities the right to fix rents which do not make
profits out of their tenants;

¢ protect council tenants by giving them security of tenure;

¢ ensure that rent increases in the private sector will be limited by
Government action and that houses without basic amenities will not be
taken out of control;

¢ encourage the public ownership of rented property, except where an
owner-occupier shares his home with a tenant;

¢ help conserve homes and areas that can be improved with the aid of
grants rather than demolish them;

¢ reverse the disastrous fall in house-building, which will include
measures to tackle the 'lump' and other proposals which must be
worked out by both sides of the construction industry to attack the
system of casual labour in the industry and create a stable, permanent

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Oct/1974-oct-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 21

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

work force;

¢ abolish the agricultural tied cottage system;

¢ transfer housing management and allocation to elected authorities in
the New Towns nearing completion.

Rates

Everybody realises that the increasing responsibilities of local authorities
must lead to reconsideration of the whole question of local government
finance. The last Tory Government consistently rejected any alternatives to
the rating system. And it bequeathed to Labour this year's massive rate rise.
This record proves that their new proposals are vote-buying moonshine.

By contrast, the present Labour Government - like the last Labour
Government - has taken swift action to help rate-payers. This year we are
giving £150m of special help to those hardest hit by this year's rate
increases, and rates have been kept down in hard-pressed inner city areas.
And we have set up a high powered independent inquiry to try to find a
workable alternative to the rating system as a matter of urgency.

We appreciate the anxieties of rate-payers and this is why we have set up this
inquiry into local finance. But everybody has to face the fact that demands
for better local services have to be paid for. And these have to be reconciled
with demands for more local autonomy and less central direction. Public
services have to be paid for by the public - the only argument is about how
to share the costs, not how to avoid them.

Environment

Our home may be our most immediate environment. But our wider
surroundings, whether at work or at leisure, demand much greater concern
with the environment. We have published a Green Paper 'The Politics of
Environment' which discusses many ideas about our changing world.

It was a Labour Government which in 1970 set up the permanent Royal
Commission on the Environment and first appointed a Minister with overall
responsibility for the environment. Within a few months the present
Government put on the statute book the Control of Pollution Act. We
scrapped the Maplin Airport project.

There is an increasing awareness of the need to treat the natural environment
with more respect. The oil crisis was but one sharp reminder that finite
natural resources cannot be taken for granted. We live in a wasteful society
at a time of economic stringency. The Labour Government wants to reverse
this trend and has already set up a Waste Management Advisory Council,
appointed a responsible Minister, and published a Discussion Paper on the
recycling of waste.

All our policies touch at some point or other on the living, working or

recreational environment of our people. We will continue to work with the
United Nations Council on Environment Problems, because these concern

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Oct/1974-oct-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 14 of 21

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25
the whole world.
Transport

The energy crisis has underlined our objectives to move as much traffic as
possible from road to rail and to water; and to develop public transport to
make us less dependent upon the private car.

Labour's Railway Act 1974 provides for a general subsidy to passenger
services and grants for the provision of new private sidings and .other freight
facilities. Many proposed rail closures have been stopped.

Expenditure on new roads has been reviewed and priority given to the
creation of a comprehensive heavy lorry network to divert the lorries now
thundering through towns and villages. We shall continue to discourage the
building of urban motorways.

Proposals have been issued to bring all commercial ports and cargo-handling
into public ownership and control with a radical extension of worker
participation in the industry.

Further measures will be introduced to:

* co-ordinate and integrate our transport services;

¢ improve public transport, especially in rural areas;

¢ extend public ownership of road haulage;

¢ expand the system of free and concessionary fares for old people, the
blind and disabled;

* improve road safety.

Scotland, Wales and the Regions

The next Labour Government will create elected assemblies in Scotland and
Wales. It will also consult with the local authorities and other interested
parties about the democratisation of those regional bodies which are at
present non-accountable. A separate statement setting out more detailed
proposals has already been published by the Labour Party and the
Government's proposals are set out in the White Paper. Separate manifestos
are being published for Scotland and Wales.

Northern Ireland

The Labour Party is working for a political solution in Northern Ireland, but
no political initiative can succeed without the end of bombing and shooting
in an area which has suffered over 1,000 dead and more than ten times as
many injured.

Any political solution must enable Catholics and Protestants to work
together. As a first step in our policy we have provided for the election of a

Constitutional Convention to consider future government in Northern

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Oct/1974-oct-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 15 of 21

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

Ireland. It will be a Convention of Northern Irish people elected by Northern
Irish people.

The Labour Government has spelt out certain realities which the Convention
must take into account before it makes its report to Parliament at
Westminster:

¢ There must be some form of power-sharing and partnership because
no political system will survive, or be supported, unless there is
widespread acceptance of it within the community. There must be
genuine participation by both communities in the direction of affairs.

e Secondly, any pattern of government must be acceptable to the people
of the United Kingdom as a whole and to Parliament at Westminster.

¢ Thirdly, Northern Ireland, unlike the rest of the United Kingdom,
shares a common land frontier and a special relationship with another
country, the Republic of Ireland. Any political arrangements must
recognise and provide for this special relationship. There is an Irish
dimension.

When a Labour Government first sent troops into Northern Ireland it was on
a temporary basis and their task was to stop sectarian violence. The Army
cannot replace the police and it will be the aim of the Labour Government to
encourage the whole community to support the police service which would
enable the Army to make a planned, orderly and progressive reduction in its
present commitment.

Britain has a responsibility in Northern Ireland and the Labour Party rejects
the view that the troops should be pulled out in advance of a political
solution. A sudden withdrawal in advance of any political settlement would
leave a vacuum which would certainly be filled by para-military groups,
with a grave possibility of civil war.

The Labour Government reaffirms its intention to phase out detention for all
sections of the community in Northern Ireland when, but only when, the
security situation permits. As an earnest of this intention, the Secretary of
State for Northern Ireland has begun a programme of releases, in addition to
those ordered by the Commissioners as part of the normal review procedure.
More and more cases are being tried in the courts. Meanwhile, the Labour
Government has established the Gardiner Committee to make a
comprehensive review of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act
1974.

Our appeal is to all the people of Northern Ireland. It is our desire to harness
the new awareness among many Catholics and Protestants of their social and
economic interests and to enable them to fulfil their aspirations through
political means. Labour's policy offers a new opportunity to achieve this.

Individual Rights and the Community

It is part of the very purpose of the Labour Party's existence to protect and

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Oct/1974-oct-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 21

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

extend the processes of democracy at all levels. It was a Labour Government
which introduced the law which allows a citizen to sue Government itself;
established the Parliamentary Commissioner; and legislated against racial
discrimination and to enforce equal pay. Now we want to give a much bigger
say to citizens in all their various capacities - as tenants, shoppers, patients,
voters. Or as residents or workers in areas where development proposals
make them feel more planned against than planned for.

Labour believes that respect for the law must be firmly based on the rights of
the citizen and on his or her obligations to the whole community. We share
the view of those who are alarmed at the growth of violence in our society,
particularly among young people. Labour believes that law-abiding citizens
are entitled to full protection. We will strengthen and uphold the police in the
exercise of their proper functions. We reject entirely the view that law
enforcement should ever be a matter for self appointed and politically
motivated private armies.

Labour respects the rule of law; it does not respect those who want to be
unofficial enforcement officers or their own special version of it. We shall
also vigorously pursue policies for the elimination of areas of deprivation
which are the most dangerous breeding grounds of juvenile and other crime.
A Labour Government set up the Law Commission machinery to overhaul
the whole body of our laws, some of which are out of date and irrelevant. In
the interests of a wider, more just and effective democracy we shall seek to:

¢ give real equality to women;

¢ strengthen legislation protecting minorities;

¢ reform the law of nationality and citizenship;

¢ introduce an independent element into complaints against the police;

e make legal advice more accessible to those most in need of help;

¢ extend legal aid to certain tribunal hearings;

* encourage local authorities in a diversity of neighbourhood or
community consultation;

¢ work with the co-operative movement to develop its role through the
creation of a Co-operative Development Agency and in other ways.

Labour believes that the process of government should be more open to the
public. We shall:

¢ replace the Official Secrets Act by a measure to put the burden on the
public authorities to justify withholding information;

¢ establish compulsory registers of interest for all MPs, councillors,
peers, senior civil servants, senior council officials, and others in the
upper reaches of the public service;

¢ protect the citizen from unwarranted and mischievous intrusion into
the citizen's private affairs.

A Charter for Women

Changes in our society over recent years have emphasised the importance of

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Oct/1974-oct-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 21

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

providing practical equal opportunities for women rather than making polite
noises about equality. We have already made a start towards equal
citizenship by giving British women, married to foreign husbands, the same
rights as British men with foreign wives.

The Labour Government's decisions provide a new deal for women. We will:

¢ ensure that by the end of 1975 Labour's Equal Pay Act will be fully
effective throughout the land;

¢ introduce a comprehensive free family planning service;

¢ legislate for equality of treatment in social security;

e make provision for maternity leave;

¢ introduce a new child cash allowance to be paid (including the first
child) usually to mothers;

¢ extend nursery education and day care facilities;

¢ bring a fairer system of family law with new family courts;

¢ reform housing law, to strengthen the rights of mothers on the break-
up of marriage: and introduce other reforms proposed by the Finer
Committee on One Parent Families;

* increase educational opportunities for girls, including further
education, training and compulsory day release.

We also intend to legislate directly on new rights for women, through a Sex
Discrimination Bill as set out in our White Paper. The proposals cover:
employment, training, education, housing and the provision of goods,
facilities and services (including mortgages and H.P., etc.) There will also be
new machinery to ensure the enforcement of these measures.

But of course all our proposals - about prices and consumer protection and
homes and education and full employment - will help to improve life for all
the women of our country.

And we are determined to see more of them from all walks of life - in
Parliament, on local councils and other public bodies - including political
parties and trade union committees.

The Common Market

Our genuine concern for democratic rights is in sharp contrast to the Tory
attitude. In the greatest single peacetime decision of this century - Britain's
membership of the Common Market - the British people were not given a
chance to say whether or not they agreed to the terms accepted by the Tory
Government. Both the Conservatives and the Liberals have refused to
endorse the rights of our people to make their own decision. Only the
Labour Party is committed to the right of the men and women of this country
to make this unique decision.

The Labour Government pledges that within twelve months of this election

we will give the British people the final say, which will be binding on the
Government - through the ballot box - on whether we accept the terms and

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Oct/1974-oct-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 18 of 21

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

stay in or reject the terms and come out.

Labour is an internationalist party and Britain is a European nation. But if
the Common Market were to mean the creation of a new protectionist bloc,
or if British membership threatened to impoverish our working people or to
destroy the authority of Parliament, then Labour could not agree.

Within one month of coming into office the Labour Government started the
negotiations promised in our February manifesto on the basis set out in that
manifesto. It is as yet too early to judge the likely results of the tough
negotiations which are taking place. But whatever the outcome in Brussels,
the decision will be taken here by the British people.

Policy for Peace - International Co-operation
and Security

The nations of the world are becoming ever more economically and
politically interdependent. The energy crisis of last winter could not be
solved by any individual country acting on its own - international co-
operation was required. The same is true if the world is to succeed in solving
the problems of inflation, of poverty, of economic growth and full
employment. We are more than ever one world. Labour's foreign policy is,
therefore, dedicated to strengthening international institutions and to world
co-operation in all fields, including trade and currency.

A Labour Government which excluded from its foreign policy the ideals of
morality, equality and justice, which are at the heart of our domestic policy,
would soon lose such ideals at home. The Labour Government will,
therefore, continue its policy of strengthening international organisations and
particularly the United Nations, dedicated to the peaceful settlement of
disputes, to the promotion of human rights, to the rule of law and to the
improvement of living standards throughout the world.

We shall continue to work for a peaceful and just settlement of the disputes
in the Middle East and in Cyprus in the light of the declarations of the
United Nations and our own responsibilities.

The Labour Government has placed great emphasis on the need for closer
relations with Commonwealth countries and we shall use every means of
strengthening our ties with them. The Government has accepted the United
Nations target of 0.7% of the Gross National Product for financial aid to
developing countries in need throughout the world and will seek to move
towards it as fast as possible. We have provided special help for the
developing countries hardest hit by the crisis in oil prices and for areas of
famine and disaster, and we have set up a Disaster Unit to speed our
response to emergencies. We shall direct our aid towards the poorest
countries and to the poorest people and give emphasis to rural development.
In recent negotiations between the European Economic Community and the
African, Pacific and Caribbean countries we have sought, with some success,
to establish a more generous and liberal trading pattern to meet their needs.

We oppose all forms of racial discrimination and colonialism. We will
continue to support the liberation movements of Southern Africa. By a
decision of the Government arms are no longer being supplied to South
Africa. The Labour Government will seek to end the unlawful South African
occupation of Namibia. The policy of sanctions against Rhodesia has been
intensified and we will agree to no settlement which does not have the
agreement of the African people of that country.

The policy of détente between East and West has brought a relaxation of
tension in Europe as in other parts of the world. It is the objective of the
Labour Government to bring the current negotiations in the Geneva
Conference on European Security and Co-operation to a successful
conclusion.

The Labour Government is conducting the widest ranging defence review to
be carried out in peacetime; and we shall, in consultation with our Allies,
press forward with our plans to reduce the proportion of the nation's
resources devoted to defence so that the burden we bear will be brought into
line with that carried by our main European allies. Such a realignment
would, at present levels of defence spending, mean achieving annual savings
over a period on defence expenditure by Britain of several hundred million
pounds. If in time this entails closure of or cutting back on defence
establishments, alternative sources of employment will be sought, where
possible by taking on major contract work and research for outside industry.

Starting from the basis of the multilateral disarmament negotiations, we will
seek the removal of American Polaris bases from Britain. We have
renounced any intention of moving towards a new generation of strategic
nuclear weapons.

The Labour Government will maintain its support for NATO as an
instrument of détente, no less than of defence. The ultimate objective of the
movement towards a satisfactory relationship in Europe must be the mutual
and concurrent phasing out of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The
Government will continue to work for the success of détente by playing an
active role in the multilateral disarmament negotiations now taking place in
Vienna and will back this diplomacy by improving bilateral relations with
the USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe up to the limit that the
situation in each case allows.

We shall continue to improve relations between Britain and China.

Time for Decision

We have not tried in this manifesto to pretend that there is some simple, easy
way out of the crisis which confronts us. But we have tried to set out the
kind of programme needed to unite the nation against the dangers ahead; a
programme designed to create a fairer, more democratic and more socially
just society.

October 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

We have made no easy promises. Our programme has been fully costed. And
we have weighed those costs carefully. But we have set our aims high. We
are a democratic socialist party and our objective is to bring about a
fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of wealth and power in
favour of working people and their families.

Now it is for the voters of our nation to make their decision. The
Government is pledged to the service of the nation. But only the nation,

working with the right leadership, can solve its problems. We believe it will.
Britain will win with Labour.

February 1974 Labour Party
Manifesto

 

 

Let us work together - Labour's way out of the
crisis

Forward by Harold Wilson, Leader of the
Labour Party

I welcome this Election - I welcome, more than anything else, this
opportunity for the British people to give their verdict upon the last three
years and eight months of Conservative Government. Let the people vote; let
us work together again.

This Manifesto was published by the Labour Party National Executive

Committee and Parliamentary Committee on 11 January last. Since then the
situation has deteriorated gravely, and the nation knows it is in crisis. This is
Labour's policy for that crisis-and to this we pledge ourselves when elected.

The Government called this election in panic. They are unable to govern,
and dare not tell the people the truth.

Our people face a series of interlocking crises. Prices are rocketing. The
Tories have brought the country to the edge of bankruptcy and breakdown.
More and more people are losing their jobs. Firms are going out of business.
Housing costs are out of reach for so many families. The Common Market
now threatens us with still higher food prices and with a further loss of
Britain's control of its own affairs. We shall restore to the British people the
right to decide the final issue of British membership of the Common Market.

The British people were never consulted about the Market. Even more, the
country was deceived in 1970 about the Government's intentions on jobs and
prices. They will not be deceived again. Today the people of Britain know
that reasonable leadership by Government can achieve an honourable
settlement of the mining dispute and get the country back to work. Only
stubborn refusal by an arrogant Conservative administration stands in our
way.

The new Labour Government will see that the present dispute is settled by

negotiation. We shall control prices and attack speculation and set a climate
fair enough to work together with the unions.

February 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

This Election is not about the miners. They are in the firing line today. The
housewife has been in the firing line ever since Mr. Heath was elected. Let
us now choose a Government willing to face up to Britain's problems; let us
elect a Government of all the people; let us work together.

Harold Wilson

Britain needs a new Government, and the Labour Party is ready with the
policies essential to rescue the nation from the most serious political and
economic crisis since 1945. We do not say that the dangers confronting us
can be quickly dispelled; rising prices and housing costs and the new threat
to our livelihood from the world-wide oil crisis cannot be held in check at a
stroke. We do say that the problems cut so deep that the solutions must cut
deep also. The sooner Labour gets the chance to heal the savage wounds
inflicted upon our society in recent years, and to turn the hopes and exertions
of our people in a new direction, the better for the nation as a whole.

In this sense, we face not merely economic perils of a new dimension; we
face a crowning test of our democracy - whether we can show the resilience,
the ingenuity, the courage, the imagination, the sense of community
necessary to meet the economic perils.

The Labour Party is proud of the contribution we made to the nation's
salvation at critical times in our history, and it is in the same mood that we
approach the interlocking crises of the 1970s.

Immediately, for the vast majority of families, the economic crisis takes the
form of fear for their jobs, ever-rising prices, particularly food prices, and
ever-rising housing costs, particularly council rents and high mortgage rates,
coupled with the most drastic cuts in their income which our people have
experienced since the 1930s - caused by the three-day working week
introduced in panic by Government decree on January 1. For the nation the
economic crisis involves an appalling balance of payments deficit, mounting
debt and an ever sinking pound.

Apparently, the aim of the Prime Minister is to continue the scourge of the
three-day week until he has secured a political victory over the miners. He
scolds them as national enemies at the very moment when their services are
more than ever indispensable to the nation. The folly of this style of politics
passes description. But one day soon the Government will have to make a
settlement with the miners; let us hope the clash has not by then become so
bitter that the long-term prospect of sustaining an effective coal industry is
fatally impaired.

The Tory Legacy

The longer the Conservative Government survives the more desperate the
situation a Labour Government will inherit. The British people will
understand if we are then compelled to give so absolute a priority to
rebuilding the economic fabric of the nation that some of our expenditure

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Feb/1974-feb-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 12

February 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

will have to be delayed. The graver our economic situation the more
important it will be to protect the poorer members of the community - such
as the pensioners - by a drastic re distribution of wealth and income.
However, the nature of the crisis will require that the structural changes we
propose should be made even more urgently.

Whatever the circumstances in which we take office, we shall still have to
meet the menaces of the mounting price of oil, of a &pound;2,000 million
deficit on the balance of payments, and of even more rapidly rising prices.
How Labour will tackle that long-standing challenge of inflation naturally
forms a central part of this document. But let us consider first the energy
crisis.

The Energy Crisis

A huge addition is now being made to the price Britain must pay for oil from
the Middle East and elsewhere, including heavy additional burdens on the
balance of payments. Every available step must be taken to enforce the most
efficient use of fuel and this must clearly be decided on a national scale.
Government intervention in the allocation of precious energy resources
would be willingly accepted by the community as a whole.

First, and with the utmost urgency, the coal industry must be given a new
status, perspective, and security. In particular, the case which the National
Union of Mineworkers has long presented is now more than ever seen to be
in the national interest. A Labour Government will give the mining industry
the backing it needs to revise its plans on a more ambitious scale.
Immediately, the present Government should set up a Commission,
composed of representatives of the NCB, the NUM, and the Government
itself, to re-examine the industry's future, including distribution, in the light
of the new necessities, and to report within three months.

Second, the new situation has greatly strengthened Labour's determination
to ensure not only that the North Sea and Celtic Sea oil and gas resources are
in full public ownership, but that the operation of getting and distributing
them is under full Government control with majority public participation.
We cannot accept that the allocation of available world output should
continue to be made by multi-national oil companies and not by
Governments. We will not permit Britain's own resources to be parceled out
in this way. It is public owner ship and control that will enable the British
people, through its Government, to fix the pace of exploitation of our oil,
and the use to which it is put, so as to secure maximum public advantage
from our own resources.

Third, a British Government should take the initiative to set up an Inter
national Energy Commission. Such a body, designed to establish a rational
international allocation of available oil resources, together with research into
new forms of fuel, should represent not only the industrialised nations but
also the developing countries, which are bound to suffer most cruelly.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Feb/1974-feb-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 12

February 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

Fourth, the energy crisis has further profound implications for the way we
conduct our whole transport system. If we are to conserve precious fuel we
must do two things: one, move as much traffic as possible from road to rail;
and two, develop public transport to make us less dependent on the private
car. This will involve large scale investment in railways, tubes and buses and
a fares policy which puts the needs of the travelling public first.

Fifth, the oil crisis is only one example of the problems which confront all
nations in connection with the exploitation of the finite natural resources of
raw materials of the earth. A Labour Government must co-operate
internationally to use carefully the world's resources in the long-term public
interest of both the developing and developed nations and to reject the
present concepts of profiteering exploitation.

The Underlying Crisis

Three years ago when Labour was in power, Britain had a big and growing
surplus on the balance of payments. Mortgage rates stood at 8.5 per cent;
Labour had built two million houses in six years; and the rise in the cost of
living had been held down to less than 5per cent a year. Today interest rates
are at record high levels, and house building is at its lowest for more than ten
years. The cost of living has gone up by 10 per cent a year and food prices
have risen by no less than 18 per cent in one year.

The present Government came to office with promises of lower taxation,
stable prices, reduced unemployment and increased financial strength. Three
years later we have experienced a 20 per cent devaluation of the pound (or a
‘float' downwards of that extent); unemployment has been over a million and
is now rising again; prices have risen faster than at any time in living
memory; and tax cuts for the rich have been paid for by price rises for the
rest of us. We now have the lowest house building programme since 1963
combined with rampant inflation in rents and house prices. Wages are
controlled whilst unearned incomes and capital values soar. The banks have
doubled their profits through the record interest rates their customers have to
pay. 1974 will certainly produce the biggest balance of payments deficit in
our history.

The Common Market

Britain is a European nation, and a Labour Britain would always seek a
wider co-operation between the European peoples. But a profound political
mistake made by the Heath Government was to accept the terms of entry to
the Common Market, and to take us in without the consent of the British
people. This has involved the imposition of food taxes on top of rising world
prices, crippling fresh burdens on our balance of payments, and a draconian
curtailment of the power of the British Parliament to settle questions
affecting vital British interests. This is why a Labour Government will
immediately seek a fundamental re negotiation of the terms of entry.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Feb/1974-feb-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 12

February 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

We have spelled out in Labour's Programme for Britain our objectives in the
new negotiations which must take place:

The Labour Party opposes British membership of the European
Communities on the terms negotiated by the Conservative Government.

We have said that we are ready to re-negotiate.
In preparing to re-negotiate the entry terms, our main objectives are these:

e Major changes in the COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY, so that
it ceases to be a threat to world trade in food products, and so that
low-cost producers outside Europe can continue to have access to the
British food market.

¢ New and fairer methods of financing the COMMUNITY BUDGET.
Neither the taxes that form the so-called ""own resources"" of the
Communities, nor the purposes, mainly agricultural support, on which
the funds are mainly to be spent, are acceptable to us. We would be
ready to contribute to Community finances only such sums as were
fair in relation to what is paid and what is received by other member
countries.

¢ As stated earlier, we would reject any kind of international agreement
which compelled us to accept increased unemployment for the sake of
maintaining a fixed parity, as is required by current proposals for a
European ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION. We believe that
the monetary problems of the European countries can be resolved only
in a world-wide framework.

¢ The retention by PARLIAMENT of those powers over the British
economy needed to pursue effective regional, industrial and fiscal
policies. Equally we need an agreement on capital movements which
protects our balance of payments and full employment policies. The
economic interests of the COMMONWEALTH and the
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES must be better safeguarded This
involves securing continued access to the British market and, more
generally, the adoption by an enlarged Community of trade and aid
policies designed to benefit not just ""associated overseas territories"" in
Africa, but developing countries throughout the world.

¢ No harmonisation of VALUE ADDED TAX which would require us
to tax necessities.

If re-negotiations are successful, it is the policy of the Labour Party that, in
view of the unique importance of the decision, the people should have the
right to decide the issue through a General Election or a Consultative
Referendum. If these two tests are passed, a successful renegotiation and the
expressed approval of the majority of the British people, then we shall be
ready to play our full part in developing a new and wider Europe.

If re-negotiations do not succeed, we shall not regard the Treaty obligations
as binding upon us. We shall then put to the British people the reasons why

we find the new terms unacceptable, and consult them on the advisability of
negotiating our withdrawal from the Communities.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Feb/1974-feb-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 12

February 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

An incoming Labour Government will immediately set in train the
procedures designed to achieve an early result and whilst the negotiations
proceed and until the British people have voted, we shall stop further
processes of integration, particularly as they affect food taxes. The
Government will be free to take decisions, subject to the authority of
Parliament, in cases where decisions of the Common Market prejudge the
negotiations. Thus, the right to decide the final issue of British entry into the
Market will be restored to the British people.

Social Justice

Clearly, a fresh approach to the British crisis is required, and Labour insists
that it must begin with an entirely new recognition of the claims of social
justice.

To that end, urgent action is needed to tackle rising prices; to strike at the
roots of the worst poverty; to make the country demonstrably a much fairer
place to live in. For these purposes, a new Labour Government, in its first
period of office, will:

1. Bring immediate help to existing PENSIONERS, widows, the sick and the
unemployed by increasing pensions and other benefits to &pound;10 for the
single person and &pound;16 for the married couple, within the first
Parliamentary session of our Government. Thereafter these figures will be
increased annually in proportion to increases in average national earnings.
We shall also follow this by replacing the Conservative Government's
inadequate and unjust long- term pensions scheme by a comprehensive
scheme designed to take future pensioners off the means test and give full
equality of treatment to women.

2. Introduce a new scheme of help for the DISABLED.

3. Help the low paid and other families in poverty by introducing a new
system of CHILD CASH ALLOWANCES for every child, including the
first, payable to the mother.

4. Introduce strict PRICE CONTROL on key services and commodities.
Bulk purchase and new marketing arrangements will help stabilise food
prices, and selective use of subsidies will be applied to the items bearing
most heavily on the family budget. We shall re-negotiate those elements of
Common Market policy which deliberately impose food taxes on the people.

5. Repeal the HOUSING FINANCE ACT, and give back to local authorities
the right to fix rents which do not make a profit out of their tenants. We shall
extend protection from eviction to tenants of furnished accommodation;
limit rent increases in unfurnished and furnished lettings; encourage the
municipalisation of privately rented property (except where an owner-
occupier shares a house with a tenant); and take steps to secure a steady
supply of mortgage funds at reasonable rates of interest to those wishing to
buy their own homes; and abolish the agricultural tied cottage. We shall raise

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Feb/1974-feb-labour-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 13:25

Page 6 of 12

February 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

the total subsidy for local authority house building to that granted to owner-
occupiers on their mortgage payments. This will be vital to reversing the
serious fall in the housing programme under the present Government.

Land required for development will be taken into public ownership, so that
land is freely and cheaply available for new houses, schools, hospitals and

other purposes. Public ownership of land will stop land profiteering. It will
emphatically not apply to owner-occupiers.

REDISTRIBUTE INCOME AND WEALTH. We shall introduce an annual
Wealth Tax on the rich; bring in a new tax on major transfers of personal
wealth; heavily tax speculation in property - including a new tax on property
companies; and seek to eliminate tax dodging across the whole field.

Industrial Relations

These measures affecting prices and taxation policy will prove by deeds the
determination of the new Labour Government to set Britain on the road
towards a new social and economic equality. After so many failures in the
field of incomes policy - under the Labour Government but even more
seriously under the Tory Government's compulsory wage controls - only
deeds can persuade. Only practical action by the Government to create a
much fairer distribution of the national wealth can convince the worker and
his family and his trade union that 'an incomes policy' is not some kind of
trick to force him, particularly if he works in a public service or nationalised
industry, to bear the brunt of the national burden. But as it is proved that the
Government is ready to act - against high prices, rents and other impositions
falling most heavily on the low paid and on pensioners - so we believe that
the trade unions voluntarily (which is the only way it can be done for any
period in a free society), will co-operate to make the whole policy
successful. We believe that the action we propose on prices, together with an
understanding with the TUC on the lines which we have already agreed, will
create the right economic climate for money incomes to grow in line with
production. That is the essence of the new social contract which the Labour
Party has discussed at length and agreed with the TUC and which must take
its place as a central feature of the new economic policy of a Labour
Government.

A Labour Government will, therefore:
(i) Abolish the PAY BOARD apparatus set up by the Tories

(11) Repeal the INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ACT as a matter of extreme
urgency and then bring in an Employment Protection Act and an Industrial
Democracy Act, as agreed in our discussions with the TUC, to increase the
control of industry by the people

(11) Establish a standing ROYAL COMMISSION to advise on income
distribution, both earned and unearned, with particular reference to
differentials and job evaluation

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Feb/1974-feb-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 12

February 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

(iv) Establish a non-governmental CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION
SERVICE, with the task of tackling industrial disputes at both national and
local level.

Employment and Expansion

However, more will be needed if we are to create a new spirit in industry.
The British people, both as workers and consumers, must have more control
over the powerful private forces that at present dominate our economic life.
To this end we shall:

7. Sustain and expand industrial development and exports and bring about
the re-equipment necessary for this purpose through the powers we shall
take in anew INDUSTRY ACT and through the Planning Agreement system
which will allow Government to plan with industry more effectively.

8. Wherever we give direct aid to a company out of public funds we shall in
return reserve the right to take a share of the ownership of the company.

In addition to our plans set out in point 5 above for taking into common
ownership land required for development, we shall substantially extend
PUBLIC ENTERPRISE by taking mineral rights. We shall also take
shipbuilding, shiprepairing and marine engineering, ports, the manufacture
of airframes and aeroengines into public ownership and control. But we shall
not confine the extension of the public sector to the loss-making and
subsidised industries. We shall also take over profitable sections or
individual firms in those industries where a public holding is essential to
enable the Government to control prices, stimulate investment, encourage
exports, create employment, protect workers and consumers from the
activities of irresponsible multi-national companies, and to plan the national
economy in the national interest. We shall therefore include in this operation,
sections of pharmaceuticals, road haulage, construction, machine tools, in
addition to our proposals for North Sea and Celtic Sea oil and gas. Our
decision in the field of banking, insurance and building societies is still
under consideration. We shall return to public ownership assets and licences
hived-off by the present government, and we shall create a powerful
National Enterprise Board with the structure and functions set out in
Labour's Programme 1973.

9. We intend to socialise existing nationalised industries. In consultation
with the unions, we shall take steps to make the management of existing
nationalised industries more responsible to the workers in the industry and
more responsive to their consumers’ needs.

10. Regional development will be further encouraged by new public
enterprise, assistance to private industry on a selective basis, and new
REGIONAL PLANNING MACHINERY, along the lines set out in Labour's
Programme 1973. We will retain and improve the Regional Employment
Premium. Revenues from North Sea oil will be used wherever possible to
improve employment conditions in Scotland and the regions elsewhere in

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Feb/1974-feb-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 12

February 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

need of development.

11. We shall develop an active manpower policy with a powerful
NATIONAL LABOUR BOARD. In the longer term, redundant workers
must have an automatic right to retraining; redundancy should then lead not
to unemployment, but to retraining and job changing.

Social Progress

These are our measures for transforming British industry into a responsible
economic system. It is outrageous that, at a time when enormous private
wealth is being accumulated, so little effort has been made to maintain and
improve our public services. A Labour Government will:

12. Revise and expand the NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE; abolish
prescription charges; introduce free family planning; phase out private
practice from the hospital service; and transform the area health authorities
into democratic bodies.

We also intend to establish a disability benefit.

13. Expand the EDUCATION SERVICE by the introduction of a national
scheme of Nursery Schools, including day care facilities, and by a big
expansion of educational facilities for 16-18 year olds, by finally ending the
11+ and by providing additional resources for children in special need of
help. We shall speed the development of a universal system of fully
comprehensive secondary schools. All forms of tax-relief and charitable
status for public schools will be withdrawn.

14. Pay special attention to the MANPOWER NEEDS of all public services
now approaching breakdown, particularly in our inner urban areas. Our
cities desperately need and must get better services, which are properly
manned, and the resources to make this possible.

Not all of our proposals should be judged on economic tests. It is the duty of
Socialists to protect the individual from discrimination on whatever grounds.
Here several of our proposals have the advantage of bringing benefits at little
economic cost.

15. WOMEN AND GIRLS must have an equal status in education, training,
employment, social security, national insurance, taxation, property
ownership, matrimonial and family law. Women at work, whether wives and
mothers or those otherwise caring for dependent relatives, must receive more
consideration from the community. We shall create the powerful legal
machinery necessary to enforce our anti-discrimination laws.

16. Review the law of NATIONALITY so that our immigration policies are
based on citizenship, and in particular to eliminate discrimination on
grounds of colour.

17. Set up a NATIONAL CONSUMERS AUTHORITY with adequate

http://labourmanifesto.com/1974/Feb/1974-feb-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 12

February 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

finance to redress the balance between the consumer and the manufacturer
and seller.

Peace and Justice in a Safer World

As in domestic policy the lesson of the last few years in Foreign Policy is
that a narrow, selfish, inward looking approach to international problems is
doomed to failure. We are, more than ever, one world and Labour's foreign
policy will be dedicated to the strengthening of international institutions and
global co operation in response to the threats to the peace and prosperity of
us all. To this end the foreign policy of a new Labour Government will be
guided by four main principles.

One We shall seek to strengthen international organisations dedicated to the
promotion of human rights. the rule of law, and the peaceful settlement of
disputes. In particular, we shall re-dedicate Britain to the ideals of the United
Nations and the Commonwealth, two organisations treated with scant regard
by the present Government.

Two We shall commit Britain to a policy of equality at home and abroad
which would involve radical changes in aid, trade and development policies.
In particular, the next Labour Government will seek to implement the United
Nations Development Target of 0.7 per cent of GNP official aid and will
increase the aid programme to meet it, and will actively seek to re-establish
a more generous and more liberal world trading pattern for the developing
countries.

Three We shall oppose all forms of racial discrimination and colonialism.
This will mean support for the liberation movements of Southern Africa and
a disengagement from Britain's unhealthy involvement with Apartheid. We
shall intensify the policy of sanctions against Rhodesia and agree to no
settlement which does not have the whole-hearted consent of the African
majority.

Four Whilst maintaining our support for NATO as an instrument of détente
no less than of defence, we shall, in consultation with our Allies,
progressively reduce the burden of Britain's defence spending to bring our
costs into line with those carried by our main European allies. Such a
realignment would, at present levels of defence spending, mean savings on
defence expenditure by Britain of several hundred million pounds per annum
over a period. At the same time we shall work for the success of détente. We
shall participate in the multilateral disarmament negotiations and as a first
step will seek the removal of American Polaris bases from Great Britain.
The ultimate objective of the movement to wards a more satisfactory
relationship in Europe must be the mutual and concurrent phasing out of
NATO and the Warsaw Pact.

Let the Nation Decide

February 1974 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:25

The aims set out in this manifesto are Socialist aims, and we are proud of the
word. It is only by setting our aims high, even amid the hazards of our
present economic situation, that the idealism and high intelligence,
especially of our young people, can be enlisted. It is indeed our intention to:

(a) Bring about a fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of power
and wealth in favour of working people and their families

(b) Eliminate poverty wherever it exists in Britain, and commit ourselves to
a substantial increase in our contribution to fight poverty abroad

(c) Make power in industry genuinely accountable to the workers and the
community at large

(d) Achieve far greater economic equality - in income, wealth and living
standards

(e) Increase social equality by giving far greater importance to full
employment, housing, education and social benefits

(f) Improve the environment in which our people live and work and spend
their leisure.

Of course, as we insisted at the beginning, these aims, like the particular
items In the programme, cannot all be fulfilled at once. We cannot do
everything at once, and these are the priorities we have chosen. This
preliminary manifesto, drawing upon the new policy statements which the
Labour Party has discussed by its democratic process, over the past three
years, sets out the specific numbered pledges which the next Labour
Government will seek with all its strength to carry out in a single Parliament.

The task will not be easy. But we repudiate the despairing gospel preached
In some quarters that the British people cannot govern themselves and that
they have lost the art to act cohesively, through their various democratic
institutions, as a civilised community.

That charge comes most insultingly from a Conservative Government which
has adopted so many devices to corrode or destroy the power of those
democratic institutions - local authorities, the trade unions, the House of
Commons itself. These are the very instruments which Labour will use to
restore and enhance the power of British democracy.

1979 Labour Party Manifesto

The Labour Way is the Better Way

Foreward

Now, more than ever, we need Labour's traditional values of cooperation,
social justice, and fairness. This manifesto restates these Labour principles
in an action programme with a strong sense of the future. They appeal to all
our people - young and old.

The world is changing rapidly. New industrial nations are rising to challenge
our key industries on which British jobs and living standards depend.

The Labour Government is taking firm action to equip Britain to adapt to
these changes and to seize new opportunities. And we will take great care to
protect working people and their families from the hardships of change.

But although the 1980s will present a tough challenge, this country will have
many things in our favour. North Sea oil offers a golden prospect as do our
reserves of natural gas and coal. We must use these resources wisely to plan
our future to create new wealth, new jobs, and to look after the family, the
elderly, and those in need.

Too much is at stake to let the Conservatives frustrate the hopes of the
coming decade by turning back the clock to the policies that they tried in the
early seventies and that failed so badly before.

The Government's industrial strategy is about how to create more wealth and
more jobs through a constructive national partnership with unions and
management. The Conservatives will not admit that nowadays governments
must step in to help create employment, to limit prices rises, to assist
industry to modernize itself. They are ready to gamble the people's future on
a return to the nineteenth century free market' - despite its pitiless social
consequences. They are as dangerously out of their time as a penny farthing
on the motorway.

Together the people and the Labour Government, even without a
parliamentary majority, have achieved much these past five years, as the
manifesto shows. In an uncertain world suffering the worst economic trouble
for 40 years we have pointed the way forward.

But nobody who cares about Britain can rest satisfied until far, far more has
been accomplished. As long as there are men and women struggling with
low pay, mothers stretching the household budget to make ends meet,

youngsters in search of a job, children learning in out of date classrooms,
patients queuing for a hospital bed or families without a decent home - then
there is work for a Labour Government.

Our purpose is to overcome the evils of inequality, poverty, racial bigotry,
and make Britain truly one nation.

For these we need a Labour majority in Parliament. This manifesto sets out
our aims for the next five years. Here are five of our priorities.

1. We must keep a curb on inflation and prices. Inflation is our enemy
because rising prices hit most hardly at the pensioner, the low paid and
the housewife, and inflation causes loss of jobs. Labour has brought
inflation down from the alarming level caused by the Conservatives'
failure to control the supply of money.

Now we set ourselves the task of bringing inflation down to 5 per cent
in three years. It is an ambitious target. We need the assistance of
everyone. And everyone will be better off if we succeed.

2. We will carry forward the task of putting into practice the new
framework to improve industrial relations that we have hammered out
with the TUC. The first step has been the creation of a new standing
pay commission which will prevent the disruption of services to the
public in future.

Next, each year there will be three-way talks between ministers,
management and unions to consider the best way forward for our
country's economy. Germany's Social Democratic Government under
Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt has proved that this is a good way
to reach agreement on how to expand output, incomes and living
standards.

I am realistic enough to know that there are bound to be set backs. But
experience reinforces what all of us know in our hearts - there is no
sound alternative to working together.

A Conservative free-for-all in pay and prices would mean endless
pitched battles that would be fatal to the interests of all of us. The
Labour way is the better way.

3. We give a high priority to working for a return to full employment. A
good job is a basic human right. During the last five years we have
responded to the worldwide unemployment crisis by helping more
than one million people to take up new jobs or new training.

Now we will concentrate special attention on more jobs and training
for the regions, the young and the long-term unemployed, and give
them hope for the future.

4. We are deeply concerned to enlarge people's freedom. Our policy will
be to tilt the balance of power back to the individual and the
neighbourhood, and away from the bureaucrats of town hall, company
board room, the health service and Whitehall.

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

Industrial democracy - giving working men and women a voice in the
decisions which affect their jobs - is an idea whose time has come.
Council tenants will have more freedom from bureaucratic control in
their own homes. Parents and teachers will have a greater freedom to
influence the running of their children's schools. Whitehall will
devolve power, in an acceptable form to Scotland. Local services will
be handed back to local authorities closer to the people. These are
practical ways to set the people free.

5. We will use Britain's influence to strengthen world peace and defeat
world poverty. Europe has been at peace for over 30 years but ours is
still a dangerous world with more armaments than ever before. Labour
will keep Britain strong but we will also work hard for disarmament. It
cannot be right that 15 million children in poorer countries die before
they are five - yet the world spends so much on the means of
destruction. There is a compelling moral need to raise the standard of
life of all the world's citizens - no matter where they live.

We are ready and willing to work with our European partners in closer unity.
But we must record that in some aspects of its work the Common Market
lacks common sense.

Above all the agricultural policy is wasteful and expensive. In standing
squarely against the discredited aspects of the dear-food policy, we are in
fact defending the interests of European families just as much as British
families. A nonsense is a nonsense in any language.

The Labour Government will give a strong lead in the decade ahead. But no
government can do it all. Our purpose is to deepen the sense of unity and
kinship and community feeling that has always marked out our fellow
countrymen and women. No nation can succeed by accepting benefits
without responsibilities. I ask everybody who shares our ideals and our faith
in Britain to join with us in securing the return of a government that dares to
turn the dream of a caring society into practical action. And then work with
us to complete the building of a Britain offering hope, social justice, and
fairness to all.

James Callaghan

This election is about the Britain of tomorrow - the kind of country we want
to live in, the kind of community we wish for our children. In choosing their
government, the people will be deciding what values and ideals will guide
the nation in the critical years ahead. In this manifesto, Labour puts forward
its policies for the future. The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party
and proud of it. Labour seeks to build a stronger and more prosperous
Britain - and we are determined to see that all our people share fully in that
prosperity. We want a Britain which is open and democratic and which puts
fair earnings for working people and the needs of the under-privileged
before the demands of private profit.

Over the past five years, the Labour Government have laid the foundations

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

of a stronger economy.

When Labour came to govern, in March, 1974, Britain was facing the most
dangerous crisis since the war. The Tory programme of confrontation and
social injustice had brought the country almost to its knees. Unlit streets,
unheated homes, shut-down factories - these were the fruits of the Tory
three-day week. We were £1,000m in deficit in our national balance of
payments, even before the rising oil prices. Prices were soaring month by
month. Industry was enfeebled by years of under-investment. To top it all,
Britain then had to contend with the four-fold rises in oil prices and the
worldwide inflation and unemployment.

Our inheritance was a Britain in crisis. The new Labour Government sought
cooperation in place of confrontation. Instead of division, we offered social
justice. In place of compulsion, we worked to win consent for the tough
economic measures we knew were needed. We forged a new partnership
between the Labour Government and working people.

Our country has come a long way since then. The rate of inflation has been
brought under control. It has become possible to improve living standards, to
cut taxation and increase child benefit, pensions and benefits to the disabled
to rates which more than overtake costs and inflation.

And over the past year, unemployment has at last begun to fall. Now we
offer a programme to carry Britain through the 1980s.

The Fight against Rising Prices

Nothing so undermines a nation as inflation. Not only does it make the
family's task of budgeting more difficult, it is a threat to jobs and a standing
invitation to our overseas competitors to invade our markets.

Now, with the renewed cooperation of the trade union movement, Labour
will continue the battle against rising prices. With the wholehearted backing
of the TUC, we have set ourselves a new target, to get inflation down to 5
per cent by 1982.

Our approach will be threefold:

Firstly, Labour will strengthen the Price Commission, giving it greater
powers to initiate investigations and reduce prices, in contrast to the Tories
who threaten its abolition. We will expand its powers to combine its
functions with those of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to ensure
that consumers are not exploited by monopoly producers or unfair practices.
We will further strengthen and extend consumer protection, in both the
public and private sectors.

Secondly, Labour will seek radical reform of the Common Market's common

agricultural policy, and will oppose any further increases in common prices
until food surpluses have disappeared.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

Thirdly, in contrast to the Tories' savage free-for-all which leads to soaring
inflation and industrial chaos, the Labour Government will work with the
TUC to achieve our agreed inflation target of 5 per cent in 1982. The Labour
Government and the TUC have jointly agreed to set up a standing
commission on comparability which will ensure that public sector workers,
including those who are low-paid, receive fair wages that are in line with
those paid in the private sector.

For the private sector, we declare our aim to be a high wage, high
productivity, low unit cost economy. To this end, we pledge ourselves to
make a reality of fair deal collective bargaining, in keeping with the criteria
set down in the joint statement.

This agreement is a far better way of achieving industrial peace, prosperity
and more stable prices than confrontation with the trade union movement.

Here is an agreement which can deliver industrial peace, fair wages, and
greater price stability.

Jobs and Prosperity

In the major industrial nations of Europe and America, 17 million people are
out of work. In Britain alone we have to find jobs for 170,000 new workers
every year.

The Labour Government will pursue policies which give a high priority to
the return to full employment. This must go hand-in-hand with keeping
down inflation. We therefore aim at a rate of growth of 3 per cent or more.

Our North Sea oil gives us an advantage in securing full employment and a
rise in living standards. The new technologies also hold out the prospect of
faster growth and a better quality of life for all. This is particularly true of
microtechnologies (the silicon chip) which will have a major impact on the
lives of everybody. Only a Labour Government can ensure that our people as
a whole derive the benefit.

In order to take full advantage of these opportunities, we must improve our
industrial competitiveness at home and abroad - and that means making sure
our industries adapt to new markets and technological changes. It also means
easing the costs of rapid industrial change for working people. The use of
crude market forces advocated by the Tories will not and cannot achieve
these changes in a way that is acceptable to the British people. What we
need is a firm industrial and employment strategy from a Labour
Government aimed at increasing productivity, adding to investment, and
creating new jobs.

We shall expand and improve programmes of training and retraining in
skills.

We shall expand the work and finance of the National Enterprise Board,
using public ownership to sustain and create new jobs, and ensure that we

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

get an adequate return on our investment.
We shall continue our strong policy of regional incentives.

We shall expand the work of the Welsh and the Scottish Development
Agencies. The Labour Government will create similar development agencies
in the English regions suffering similar problems.

To ensure that private industry plays its full part in the drive for prosperity
and full employment, we shall conclude planning agreements with the major
industrial companies, with the necessary back-up statutory powers to do so.
We shall establish within Government the necessary arrangements to make
this effective.

We reaffirm the policy that we have pursued that wherever we give direct aid
to a company. Out of public funds, we shall reserve the right to take a
proportionate share of the ownership of the company; and wherever
possible, this public support will be channelled through the planning
agreement system.

Labour will continue with major aids to investment, including the selective
investment scheme which has already supported projects in excess of
£1,000m.

Labour will develop the work and funding of the Cooperative Development
Agency in expanding cooperative enterprise.

This is a positive strategy for industry, based on cooperation between
Government, trade unions, and management. The new agreement between
the Government and the TUC, which includes provision for an agreed
annual assessment of the nation's economic prospects, lays the foundation
for working together in the 1980s.

Labour will work for an international agreement under which all countries
are helped and encouraged to expand their economies to the limit of their
productive capacity and so stimulate world trade. This will help British
exports to increase still faster. But to do this, Britain needs a healthy and
expanding economy.

We also need a programme to protect employment while the necessary
changes and modernization of our industry takes place. We will not allow
our industries to be wiped out by excessive imports before they have had a
chance to recover their strength. The Labour Government will ensure that
imports enter our market only within acceptable limits.

Under the Labour Government, we shall continue with programmes like the

short-time working compensation scheme, the job release scheme, the small

firms employment subsidy, and job creation programmes which have already
created and saved over one million jobs.

We do not accept that individuals whose jobs have disappeared should
remain unemployed for periods of time which demoralise them and

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

impoverish their families. We pledge ourselves to the progressive
introduction of a scheme which will ensure within the lifetime of the next
Parliament that no one shall be unemployed for more than 12 months
without receiving either the offer of a job or of retraining.

Labour will also promote an expansion in housing, the health service,
education and other social services which have such a crucial part to play in
providing jobs as well as in meeting vital social needs.

If full employment is to be achieved, longer holidays, time off for study,
earlier voluntary retirement, and a progressive move to a 35-hour working
week, must play an increasing role during the 1980s. But these changes in
the pattern of employment are not only necessary to keep jobs, but also to
improve the quality of living for working people, to give them more leisure
and the means to enjoy it to which their work and modern technology
entitles them.

Labour must ensure that the financial institutions of this country play their
part in our programme for the revival of industry. We acknowledge the many
successes of the financial sector, but we are also concerned that the lure of
short-term profit can outweigh the social gains to be had from industrial
investment.

The banking sector would benefit from increased competition. We therefore
intend to bring about a major development in the Girobank so that it will
compete on equal terms with the big four clearing banks and improve
standards of service to small savers. The National Savings Bank has a
valuable role to play in providing a unique service and in making a
significant contribution to financing the Government's operations, thus
reducing our reliance on the City. By developing the Girobank and the
National Savings Bank to their full potential, a Labour Government will
ensure for the country a vigorous public banking sector.

Agriculture and Fishing

Agriculture has always flourished best under Labour Governments. We have
already taken many steps to encourage production, while giving consumers
and workers in the industry the best possible deal. Agricultural workers in
tied cottages have been given security of tenure in England and Wales; we
intend to do the same for Scotland.

Elsewhere we give our proposals to reform the EEC's common agricultural
policy. There must also be a vigorous expansion of agriculture at home.
Labour will:

Develop measures of special assistance to farmers on hill and marginal land.
Consider in the light of the official enquiry we have set up into agricultural

land, protection for farmers against the intrusion of financial institutions into
this field. Continue to demand a common fisheries policy that gives

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

preference in our own waters to a strong British fishing industry - betrayed
by the last Tory Government - with a secure future. We will continue to take,
and enforce, national measures to conserve stocks. We shall complete the
process of decasualisation in the industry.

Energy

The world energy situation is deteriorating. Energy policy is vitally
important to our survival. We shall strengthen the democratic planning of the
long-term developments of Britain's own energy sources, backed by the
necessary powers, under full parliamentary control.

Britain is almost alone among major industrial nations in achieving energy

self-sufficiency; our resources have been developed, thanks to the skills of

our scientists and of the workers. The Tories handed over our oil wealth to

the multinationals. We changed that and will ensure that this energy wealth
is developed wisely for industrial regeneration and public provision, and its
fruits distributed fairly.

We will continue to support Plan for Coal! for the mining industry, which has
a key role to play in our energy future.

In any programme for nuclear power, safety must continue to be the
dominant factor. Any such development would have to take place within the
public sector. We shall maintain strict safeguards over the disposal of nuclear
waste. We have not decided whether to build a commercial fast breeder
reactor. A major study and public inquiry would be held before any decision
were to be taken.

We shall progressively increase the national stake in the North Sea, to
safeguard the British people and regenerate British industry.

We have initiated and will continue a major programme of alternative
energy, energy saving, through insulation grants, advice to industry, the
'Save-It' campaign, and an energy-saving approach to transport.

We shall continue to help people to afford adequate light, heat, and power in
their homes.

A Fairer Britain

Economic success is not an end in itself. For the Labour Party, prosperity
and fairness march hand in hand on the road to a better Britain. During the
next Parliament, we intend to continue our fight against all forms of social
injustice.

The tax system must be fair and seen to be so. We will mount an all-out
attack on tax evasion. Everybody must make their fair contribution to the

country's finances. In the next Parliament, we shall introduce an annual

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

wealth tax on the small minority of rich people whose total net personal
wealth exceeds £150,000.

Labour will continue to reduce the burden of income tax, and raise the tax
threshold below which people pay no income tax.

Despite the difficulties of the economic situation, Labour has kept its pledge
to look after the poor and vulnerable in our society - pensioners, the sick or
disabled people, and the unemployed. Pensions are up by 20 per cent in real
terms on the Tory level. Labour's new child benefit gives £4 a week per child
for every mother. Disabled people have new benefits: a non-contributory
invalidity pension, an invalid car allowance, and a mobility allowance for
people who cannot walk.

The Labour Government will build on our record of achievement. Labour
will:

As a next step towards a married couple pension of half gross average
earnings and a single person's pension of one-third gross average earnings,
increase pensions in November to around £35 for a married couple and £22
for a single person. Widows', invalidity and other long-term benefits will be
increased in line.

As a step towards meeting our objective that families get as much help for
their children when working as they do on short-term benefits, increase child
benefit to £4.50 in November as a next step towards further help.

Give further cash and other help to one-parent families. Raise the burial
grant to a more realistic level.

For disabled people, Labour will:

Work for the further implementation of Labour's Chronically Sick and
Disabled Persons Act.

Increase the mobility allowance again next November and continue to pay
the mobility allowance beyond pension age without an upper age limit.

Introduce a new disablement allowance to include the blind, varying
according to the severity of disablement.

A Healthier Nation

The nation's health must have priority. We reject Tory plans to create two
health services: one for the rich, financed by private insurance with a
second-class service for the rest of us. Labour reaffirms its belief in a
comprehensive national health service for all our people. We oppose Tory
proposals for higher prescription charges and charges for seeing a doctor or
being in hospital. Our aim is to abolish all charges in the NHS.

For all the talk of cuts, the truth is that the Labour Government are spending

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

over £600m a year more on health in real terms than the Tories. Labour will
devote a higher proportion of the nation's wealth to the health service and the
personal social services.

Labour's health priorities include a renewed shift from hospital treatment to
care in the community through family doctors and health centres with
supporting social services; a comprehensive family planning service within
the NHS; more emphasis on the prevention of illness and handicap; a fairer
share of health funds across the country; more help for the frail elderly, the
mentally ill, and handicapped; better training and opportunities for nurses
and all workers in the health services; a new career structure for hospital
doctors; and a greater recognition and reward to those consultants whose
only professional commitment is to the NHS.

We will streamline the bureaucratic and costly structure the Tories created
and give a bigger say in running the NHS to the public and staff.

We are phasing-out the remaining private beds in NHS hospitals. We shall
stop queue-jumping.

Education

The Labour Party believes in equality of opportunity. Universal
comprehensive education, which is central to our policy, must be completed
in the 1980s. Already class sizes are the lowest ever recorded. The ratio of
pupils to teachers is now only 23.6 in primary schools and 16.9 in secondary
schools. Labour will continue to give high priority to reducing class sizes
further.

Independent schools still represent a major obstacle to equality of
opportunity. Labour's aim is to end, as soon as possible, fee-paying in such
schools, while safeguarding schools for the handicapped. Labour will end as
soon as possible the remaining public subsidies and public support to
independent schools.

The Under-fives

Under this Labour Government, the proportion of 3- and 4-year-olds in
nursery classes and schools has doubled. Local authorities will be
encouraged to do much more. Our aim is to provide nursery education for 90
per cent of our 4-year-olds and half of our 3-year-olds by the early 1980s.

The Needs of Youth

We will provide a universal scheme of education and training for all 16-19
year olds, if necessary backed by statute. We will remove the financial
barriers which prevent many young people from low income families from
continuing their education after 16.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

We will reintroduce legislation for income-related mandatory awards to all
16-18 year olds on all full-time courses.

Further and Higher Education

Further education places have increased by 25,000 under Labour. Labour
will substantially increase the opportunities for people from working-class
backgrounds -particularly adults - to enter further and higher education. We
want to see more workers given time off work for study. To this end, the
places at the Open University have increased from 42,000 in 1974 to 80,000
in 1978. We propose to extend the present mandatory grant system. Labour
supported the adult literacy scheme, and will ensure its continuation.

Youth

Britain has the best youth programme in Europe. We have the youth
opportunities programme, which guarantees every school-leaver either a job
or a training place or employment experience. We are supporting a great
range of opportunities for young people. Labour will see the youth service
expanded to meet the social and recreational needs of young people.

Sport

In a society where leisure is increasing year by year, Labour wants to make
facilities for sport and leisure available to all. We will continue to put more
money into these activities.

Homes for All

Over /.5 million homes have been completed since Labour took office. A
further one million sub-standard or near slum houses have been substantially
improved with Government finance, under the 1974 Housing Act. The
homeless have had a new deal. And yet too many of our people still live in
unacceptable housing conditions. We will continue a substantial programme
of housebuilding and home improvement.

Under our new system of housing investment programmes, local councils
will continue to play a central part in meeting housing needs.

We reject the philosophy that tenants are second-class citizens. Labour has
already published its new Housing Bill which will give a new deal to council
tenants to give them security of tenure; the right to a written tenancy
agreement; the right to improve the home; the right to take in lodgers; the
right to be consulted on housing management decisions; easier residential
qualifications; and a new national scheme to help tenants to move from one
part of the country to another.

We will improve the quality of our less popular council estates, which will

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

mean relaxing the rules under which improvements to estates less than 30
years old cannot attract Government subsidy.

Labour does not oppose the sale of council houses to sitting tenants of two
years' standing who want to buy, so long as such sales are at a fair price and
do not damage a local authority's ability to meet the demands for decent
homes to rent. But Labour will continue to oppose the sales of council
housing in areas of serious housing need.

Labour also seeks to widen choice, and we shall therefore continue to help
those who wish to buy their own homes.

Labour will:

Carry through its new home loan plan to give saving bonuses and interest-
free loans of up to £600 to first-time buyers.

Examine ways of expanding the scheme under which building societies lend
to home-buyers nominated by local councils, particularly for older, cheaper
properties.

Introduce new ways of lowering the cost and speeding the process of house
purchase. Labour has set up the Royal Commission on Legal Services,
which will be reporting on conveyancing. Labour policy is to end the
monopoly on house conveyancing now enjoyed by solicitors, and improve
leasehold enfranchisement. With the growth of home ownership and council
housing, private renting has entered an irreversible decline. We stand by the
principles of security of tenure and rent regulations, and will legislate to
close loopholes in the Rent Acts. We shall continue to encourage socially-
accountable landlords - local authorities, housing associations and housing
cooperatives - to take over privately rented property except where an owner-
occupier lets part of his own home.

Labour will give private tenants access to improvement grants on the same
basis as owners. We shall make it easier for a tenant to force a landlord to do
necessary repairs. We will legislate to give further protection to those who
live in mobile homes and to the owners of holiday caravans. We will set up a
new housing tribunal to replace the present confusing jumble of courts,
tribunals and committees dealing with rents, security of tenure, and other
housing problems.

Labour will give new rights to everyone whose home is tied to their job.

Building and Our Future

A well-organized and efficient construction industry is essential to the
achievement of many of our economic and social objectives. Labour will:

Plan and coordinate public sector demand on the industry, in order to help
stabilize the industry's workload.

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

Press forward with plans for decasualization and job security in the industry,
building on the work of the Construction Industry Manpower Board, and
giving their proposed registration scheme statutory backing if necessary.

Encourage the development of building workers' cooperatives.

Expand local authority direct labour organizations, ensuring that they are
efficiently run as separate municipal enterprises, publicly accountable for
their performance.

Develop and strengthen existing building capacity in the public sector so as
to establish pace-making public enterprise for large and medium sized
construction projects.

Labour and The Land

At the heart of all planning policy is the problem of the land. Labour's
Community Land Act provides the means to tackle land speculation through
public ownership. We shall seek to clarify and amend the regulations
surrounding land valuation, not least to ensure that land is valued very much
more closely to its present use value. We shall use it to ensure that social
criteria rather than maximum profit decides how land is to be used. We
intend to set up a publicly accessible register of all land.

We will authorize local authorities to charge rates on land which is left
unused. We have simplified planning procedures. We intend that in future
planning permissions not acted upon after five years will not be
automatically renewed.

The Inner City

Labour is committed to save our inner cities. With the inner city
partnerships, the new Urban Area Act, and the increased urban programme,
Labour has begun to breathe new life into our inner cities.

First, we must bring back more jobs to these areas. Our national industrial
policy will be used to bring investment to the inner cities. We will mount a
concerted effort to stimulate the development of small firms and worker
cooperatives in these areas.

Secondly, we will bring about during the lifetime of the next Parliament a

further increase in the expenditure earmarked for refurbishing our inner
cities, for education, for housing, and for the social services.

Rural Areas

The Labour Government will take measures to arrest the decline in the
quality of life in rural areas. We will increase the funds available to the
Development Commission, and widen its scope. We will reestablish the

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

Rural Development Boards in England and ensure that the Co-operative
Development Agency, the NEB, the tourist boards and the Manpower
Services Commission play an active role in rural job creation. We shall
encourage new forms of agriculture - such as fish farming.

Recognizing the importance of an adequate integrated rural transport service,
we will provide greater support for rural buses, encourage improvements in
the frequency and timetabling of conventional services, and open freight rail
lines to passenger services.

We will improve and increase public sector housing in rural areas and
improve their educational facilities and personal social services.

Our Environment

Labour is proud of its record on environmental matters. Our Standing Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution has set the pace for advance. For
the future, however, we will have to give still higher priority to this
important issue.

Labour will:
Develop policies for resource conservation.

Use our campaign for a better environment to provide the basis of secured
employment, eg in pollution control and in waste recycling.

Further reduce the lead content in petrol.

Provide an annual State of the Environment' report to Parliament. Ensure
that, before the inquiry stage of major development proposals - perhaps two
or three a year - the environmental effects are subject to detailed analysis
and the report published.

Introduce an extended clean-up campaign - 'Making Britain Clean and
Green’, and start a real drive by local authorities and voluntary groups to
clear up derelict land, and use it to the benefit of the community.

Transport

The majority of our people still depend on public transport. Labour believes
in maintaining and improving within an integrated transport system. We will
encourage closer coordination at local level between road and rail.

Under Labour, there will never be another Beeching. We will maintain the
present rail network and increase investment in the future. As much freight
as possible must be carried by rail; and the scheme whereby companies
receive grants for installing railway facilities will be extended.

Buses, especially in country areas, will continue to require a permanent and

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 14 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

substantial amount of public support to meet social needs. In areas where
free travel does not yet exist, Labour will bring in a nationwide, off-peak,
half-fares scheme for OAPs, the blind and the disabled.

We will sort out the present confusion surrounding arrangements for
children's fares, so that there are free fares up to the age of five, and reduced
fares up to 16. Those benefiting from the present free travel to school
schemes will not be affected.

For the motorist, we want to reduce bureaucracy and ensure fair treatment.
The phased abolition of vehicle excise duty will remove one source of
annoyance and irritation. Labour will press for major improvements for
customers in motorway service areas and garage repairs generally.

Heavy lorries will be made to carry, through taxation, their full share of road
costs, including environmental costs. We will take further measures to
reduce noise and pollution. The National Freight Corporation must be
enabled to provide the basis for expanding the public sector in the road
haulage industry. The Labour Government will continue to oppose any
proposals to increase the permitted maximum weight limit for heavy lorries,
which are inconsistent with road safety and the needs of the environment.

The road building programme will remain at its present level - but we will
adopt a more selective approach than in the past. More by-passes will be
built. Highway inquiries will also be more open, wider in scope, and with
inspectors clearly seen to be independent.

In the ports industry, we reaffirm our policy to bring commercial ports and
cargo handling into public ownership.

A Wider, More Open Democracy

A central theme of our programme for the eighties is the protection and
enhancement of our democracy.

Democracy at Work

The time has come to recognize the increasing desire of employees to have a
larger say in the decisions which vitally affect their working lives and jobs.
We also wish to harness their energies and experience in a positive
partnership to improve our industrial relationships in a way which reduced
conflict and increased cooperation. We therefore commit the Labour
Government to a major extension of industrial democracy. Democratic
practice and good industrial relations means single status in industry and a
dignified respect for all workers, whatever their plant grading.

We recognize - as have other countries - that employees should be entitled to
fall back on certain basic rights if agreement is not achieved. To this end, we
will encourage recognized trade unions to establish joint representation
committees in all companies employing more than 500 people, and place a

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 15 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

legal obligation on employers to discuss company plans with these
committees. We will establish an industrial democracy commission to
stimulate and monitor schemes of industrial democracy in the private sector
and nationalised industries.

Devolution

In our 1974 manifesto, we promised to create elected assembles in Scotland
and Wales as part of our programme of decentralization and devolution of
power. Following the result of the referendum in Wales, it is clear that the
majority there does not want an assembly, and we accept their decision. In
Scotland, however, a majority voted for devolution.

We reaffirm our commitment to devolution for Scotland. We are therefore
ready to discuss constructively with all concerned any changes which would
make the scheme in the present Act more widely acceptable, so that we can
establish a Scottish Assembly.

Law, Rights and the Community

The protection and enhancement of human rights and civil liberties is an
indispensable part of a wider democracy. We will fight against crime and
violence which affect all Western societies. We will continue to back the
police with proper resources and manpower. The police are substantially
better-paid and equipped today than they were under the Tories. At the same
time, we shall attack the social deprivation which allows crime to flourish.

Our policies on fighting deprivation and social injustice, on arresting the
decay of our inner cities, on youth employment and helping the family, will
all contribute to a happier and more law-abiding society.

During the next Parliament, we will increase law centres providing legal
help for the ordinary citizen; provide more resources for the prison and
probation services; extend legal aid to certain tribunal hearings; bring
together and coordinate the various offices of Ombudsmen; consider
responsibility for the conduct of prosecutions in the light of the report of the
Royal Commission on Criminal Procedures; and provide further help for the
victims of crime.

Democracy at Westminster

In central government, we will:

Make major improvements in the legislative process, including new methods
of considering Bills in committee, and of scrutinizing the work of
government through select committees.

Establish a more powerful and professional system of audit.

Introduce a Freedom of Information Bill to provide a system of open

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

government, and enact the proposals made by the Government in its White
Paper to reform Section Two of the Official Secrets Act.

Bring forward proposals to reform the machinery of government and the
structure of public administration to bring them into line with modern
conditions.

Reexamine the procedures for appointment to governmental and quasi-
governmental bodies, and to the boards of public enterprises, and for
recommendations for honours.

No one can defend on any democratic grounds the House of Lords and the
power and influence it exercises in our constitution. We propose, therefore,
in the next Parliament, to abolish the delaying power and legislative veto of
the House of Lords.

Local Democracy

Already, the central government pays 61 per cent of the cost of most local
services. We shall continue through the rate support grant to provide national
Exchequer assistance to ratepayers, particularly in areas of greatest need. We
shall seek ways of making finance for local government fairer to ratepayers.

Labour will extend public involvement in local government, so damaged by
the bureaucratic and costly local government system imposed by the Tories.

To this end, the Labour Government will:

Give back to large district councils in England responsibility for education,
planning, social services, local libraries and other local services.

Equality for Women

Labour's Sex Discrimination Act, Equal Pay Act, the Employment
Protection Act, and Social Security Pensions Act have already created a new
deal for Disabled housewives, single mothers, women looking after a
dependent relative -all have received help from this Labour Government.

We have made a start towards equal citizenship by giving to British women,
married to foreign husbands, the same rights as British men with foreign
wives. We have changed the regulations to make it possible for children born
abroad to British mothers to acquire British nationality.

We shall progressively eliminate the inequalities that still exist in the social
security and tax systems. We shall introduce further reforms proposed by the
Finer Committee on One-Parent Families. We have already protected the
anonymity of women victims of rape. We shall bring in a fairer system of
family law with new family courts. Labour will abolish the contributory
conditions for maternity grant and raise the level of the grant.

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

One community

Labour has already strengthened the legislation protecting minorities. The
next Labour Government will continue to protect the community against
discrimination and racialism. We will:

Give a strong lead, by promoting equality of opportunities at work
throughout the public sector.

Help those whose first language is not English.

Monitor all Government and local authority services to ensure that
minorities are receiving fair treatment.

Consider what measures may be necessary to clarify the role of the Public
Order Act and to strengthen and widen the scope of the Race Relations Act.

Review the 1824 Vagrancy Act, with a view to the repeal of Section 4.

Large-scale migration to this country is ending, but we still have some major
commitments to fulfil. Labour will honour these. A quota would merely
cause even longer delays for dependants.

Our whole immigration and citizenship law needs revision. Progress has
already been made on this with the publication of a Government Green
Paper.

Northern Ireland

For over four years, Labour has governed Northern Ireland direct from
Westminster. During this period, considerable progress has been made on the
security front and on the efforts to bring peace and stability to the Province.
Detention has been ended, a special independent Police Complaints Board
has been set up, and the police themselves are now more widely accepted in
the community.

Unfortunately, in spite of all the attempts by the Labour Government, it has
not been possible to find common agreement between the political parties on
the best form of government for Northern Ireland.

For the present, direct rule remains the only viable alternative. Any change
can be made only with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. We
will work to make it more accountable and democratic.

In the field of security, there is an essential role for the army in protecting the
people of Northern Ireland, but we will continue our policy of extending the

role of the police so as to involve all sections of the community.

We accept the recommendations of the Bennett Committee, and we will see
that they are carried out as quickly as possible to make ill-treatment

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 18 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26
impossible.

Labour has saved thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland and attracted much
investment and industry to the most under-developed areas. But at about
twice the United Kingdom average, unemployment continues at an
intolerably high level. The industrial policies set out earlier will be applied
with full force and vigour to Northern Ireland.

The Arts and the Media

Both the arts and the media play an important role in enhancing the quality
of our democracy.

Arts. Aid to the Arts Council is going up 25 per cent this year. We will
ensure more money for the Arts in future. The Arts Council should include
elected representatives.

A Labour Government will set up a British Film Authority, with a
distribution arm to stimulate investment in British film productions.

The media. Our aim is to safeguard freedom of expression; to encourage
diversity; and to guard both against the dangers of government and of
commercial control.

On broadcasting, the Labour Government will implement the proposals in its
White Paper, including instituting an Open Broadcasting Authority. We will
phase out the television licence fee for old age pensioners during the lifetime
of the next Parliament.

Animal Welfare

Under Labour's new council of animal welfare, we will have stronger control
on the export of live animals for slaughter, and conditions of factory
farming, and experiments on living animals.

Legislation to end cruelty to animals will include the banning of hare
coursing, stag and deer hunting. Angling and shooting will in no way be
affected by our proposals.

European Community

At this election, Labour will, once again, be the only major political party to
offer the British people the prospect of bringing about fundamental and
much-needed reform to the EEC.

We are concerned to ensure that Greece, Portugal, and Spain receive an early
welcome into the Community. This enlargement of the Community will
provide an opportunity to create a wider and looser grouping of European
states, thus reducing the dangers of an over-centralised and over-

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 19 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

bureaucratic EEC.

We aim to develop a Europe which is democratic and socialist, and where
the interests of the people are placed above the interests of national and
multinational capitalist groups, but within which each country must be able
to realize its own economic and social objectives, under the sovereignty of
its own Parliament and people.

A Labour Government will oppose any move towards turning the
Community into a federation.

Trade and Industry

Working with our socialist colleagues, we will defend the ability of each
member state to determine its own industrial policies. Our policy is to
encourage such measures as import ceilings and orderly marketing
arrangements where they are necessary to protect vital national economic
interests.

Member states must be able to control and plan their own energy policies
while at the same time maximizing cooperation and seeking agreement on
areas of mutual interest, such as research and development.

Food and Agriculture

Membership of the Community has compelled us to pay more for our food
than otherwise would be the case. The CAP raises serious problems for
British agriculture -distorting the balance of production; decreasing
consumption through inflated prices in the shops; and stopping the industry
from growing. That is why Labour seeks a fundamental reform of the CAP.

The Tories back a policy which would raise food prices by the equivalent of
£90 a year on the average family budget.

Labour will seek to:

End the scandal of food surpluses - which cost £900m per year in storage
alone.

Improve access for cheap food from countries outside the EEC.

Reduce EEC support prices; and press for more scope under the CAP for
national support arrangements, such as our beef premiums.

A change in emphasis from price support to structural reform.
The reforms we are calling for are in the interests of consumers throughout
every country in the Community. We will do our utmost to gain the

cooperation of our EEC partners. However, if these reforms are not speedily
implemented, we shall protect our interests - if necessary vetoing any further

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 20 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

increase in food prices until surpluses have been eliminated.

Economy and Finance

We will retain the freedom to determine our own budgetary policy and to
control our own currency. A Labour Government will retain the power to
impose controls on capital movements and will continue to resist any
upward harmonisation of VAT or any reduction in the existing range of zero-
rated VAT items in Britain. A Labour Government would not join an
economic and monetary union.

The Community Budget

Major reforms are needed to the Community Budget. Britain is now
providing a net subsidy to some of the other EEC countries amounting to
£900m a year. No country whose national income falls below the average for
the Community as a whole should be required to make a net contribution to
the Budget.

We should reduce the proportion (75 per cent) of the Community Budget
spent on agriculture, and the funds so released could be directed into social
and regional development.

The Labour Government will ensure that the Community Budget should
promote a fairer distribution of resources within the EEC, and the
convergence of economic performance of member states, to achieve faster
growth, higher employment and lower rates of inflation.

Parliamentary Sovereignty

The Labour Government will legislate to ensure that British ministers are
accountable to the House of Commons before making any commitment in
the Council of Ministers. Enlargement of the Community will provide the
opportunity for seeking changes in the Treaty of Rome, which would enable
the House of Commons to strengthen its powers to amend or repeal EEC
legislation. This would involve consequential amendments to the 1972
European Communities Act.

The Third World

The Labour Government will press for improvements in the Lome
Convention, for widening the scope of the EEC's aid to include the most
needy areas of the world, and for the EEC to place emphasis on trade and the
stabilization of the export prices of third world commodities.

Foreign Policy

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 21 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

The Labour Party's priority is to build a democratic socialist society in
Britain and to create the conditions necessary to free the world from poverty,
inequality and war. We condemn violations of human rights wherever they
occur and whatever the political complexion of the Government concerned,
and will further human rights in all international organizations.

Crucial to our policy is the pursuit of peace, development and disarmament
by strengthening the process of détente. We shall seek to improve relations
with the USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe, as well as with China.

We shall continue to work for the peaceful and just settlement of disputes
and the strengthening of international cooperation. The Labour Government
will, therefore, continue its policy of strengthening international
organizations, particularly the United Nations, and the Commonwealth.

We shall continue to work to bring about a just settlement of the problems of
Cyprus.

We shall work for a negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Arab conflict which
would ensure the right of all parties to achieve national self-determination
and to live in a homeland within secure and recognized borders.

Labour is totally opposed to the system of apartheid, and will continue to
support opponents of apartheid, giving humanitarian and other aid to
liberation movements of southern Africa. Labour believes that it is not only
wrong, but contrary to British long-term interests, to be closely tied
economically to South Africa. We will take active steps to reduce our
economic dependence on South Africa and discourage new investment in
South Africa by British companies. Those already operating there will be
expected to comply with a strengthened code of conduct governing
conditions of employment.

We have refused to approve the Rhodesian internal settlement and we will
continue to work for a settlement of the Rhodesia problem acceptable to the
people of Rhodesia as a whole. Until such time as an agreement is arrived at,
we will maintain and intensify sanctions against the illegal regime.

We will continue actively to support the United Nations settlement proposals
for Namibia, including upholding the territorial integrity of the country.

In respect of those countries of Latin America with dictatorial regimes,
particularly Chile and Argentina, the Labour Government will demand that
these regimes pay promptly their due debts. The restoration of human and
trade union rights will be a prior condition for the rescheduling of future
debt payments.

We will continue to pursue our policy of aid to the poorest countries and the
poorest people, with the emphasis on rural development. Under Labour, aid
is increasing at 6 per cent a year.

We will seek to implement the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of the
gross national product for official aid as soon as economic circumstances

http://labourmanifesto.com/1979/1979-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 22 of 24

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

permit.
Labour will take account of human rights considerations when giving aid.

Help will continue to be given to the victims of repressive regimes,
including the provision of refugee programmes.

The Labour Government approach the North-South dialogue in a spirit of
cooperation. It will actively participate in the UNCTAD 5 and other
negotiations seeking to establish a more just world trading system which
recognizes the needs of poorer countries.

Détente and Defence

While actively pursuing a policy of détente, the Labour Government will
continue to press for the implementation of the human rights provisions of
the Helsinki Final Act. The Labour Government will continue to work for
the success of the Mutual Balanced Force Reduction Talks in Vienna, and
will give full support to the work of the United Nations Committee on
Disarmament. The Labour Government will work for the speedy conclusion
of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We shall also give every
encouragement to our American allies to achieve a successful conclusion to
the vital Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. The Labour Government will
maintain its support for Nato as an instrument of détente no less than of
defence. The ultimate objective of a satisfactory relationship in Europe is the
mutual and concurrent phasing-out of both Nato and the Warsaw Pact.

We shall continue with our plans to reduce the proportion of the nation's
resources devoted to defence, so that the burden we bear will be brought into
line with that carried by our main allies. A Labour Government would plan
to ensure that savings in military expenditure did not lead to unemployment
for those working in the defence industries. We shall give material support
and encouragement to plans for industrial conversion so that the valuable
resources of the defence industries can be used for the production of
socially-needed goods.

In 1974, we renounced any intention of moving towards the production of a
new generation of nuclear weapons or a successor to the Polaris nuclear
force; we reiterate our belief that this is the best course for Britain. But many
great issues affecting our allies and the world are involved, and a new round
of strategic arms limitation negotiations will soon begin. We think it is
essential that there must be a full and informed debate about these issues in
the country before the necessary decision is taken.

Labour will give every encouragement to those working for the cause of
international peace. We will consider establishing a peace research institute.
We shall negotiate with our friends and allies, to prevent the supply of arms
to countries where any such supply would increase the chances of
international conflict or internal repression.

1979 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

Into the Eighties

This election comes at a time of change. unparalleled since 1945. A
generation has now grown up in a welfare state which remains the envy of
the world in health care and education. We have demonstrated a capacity for
skill and inventiveness which keeps us at the forefront of world technology.
Those are no mean achievements.

A Tory Government would put all this at risk. At work, they would substitute
confrontation for cooperation. The free market forces they support would
mean soaring inflation, rising prices and growing unemployment. Their
uncaring meanness would mean misery for millions of the most vulnerable
in our community, for their policy of cutting public expenditure can only
mean a drastic reduction in all our social services.

Against this reactionary prospect, Labour sets its vision for the future. We
seek to bring about a fundamental change in the balance of power and
wealth in favour of working people and their families. We reject the concept
that there is a choice to be made between a prosperous and efficient Britain
and a caring and compassionate society. As democratic socialists, we believe
they complement each other.

That is the spirit of this manifesto. A strong, fair, and more just society is the
prize within our grasp. It is the message of hope for the future, based on a

record of promises kept, that Labour puts to the British people at this
election.

LabourManifesto.com > 1983 > Manifesto text in a single long file

 

Foreward

Here you can read Labour's plan to do the things crying out to be done in our
country today.

To get Britain back to work. To rebuild our shattered industries. To get rid of
the ever-growing dole queues. To protect and enlarge our National Health
Service and our other great social services. To help stop the nuclear arms
race. Here you can see what Labour is determined to do, and how we shall
set about it.

But at once the objection is raised: Can we afford it? Where will the money
come from? Are we not just making promises which cannot be fulfilled?

You will find the detailed answers here. But let us emphasise a few of them
at once.

The first short, sharp answer is that what Britain cannot afford is the present
policy of accepting mass unemployment.

Mass unemployment on the scale Mrs. Thatcher and her government have
been prepared to tolerate - worse than we have ever known before and worse
than any other industrial country has experienced - imposes a crushing
burden on the whole community.

Of course it hits hardest the young denied work altogether, and their mothers
and fathers thrown out of their jobs with little chance of getting another.

But it also hits the whole country.

Mass unemployment costs the country £15 billion, £16 billion, £17 billion a
year, astronomic figures never conceived possible before, and they move
higher still every month.

Mass unemployment is the main reason why most families in Britain, all but
the very rich, are paying more in taxes today than they did four years ago
when the Conservatives promised to cut them for everybody.

Mass unemployment is the main reason why we are wasting our precious
North Sea oil riches. Since 1979 Mrs. Thatcher's government has had the
benefit of £20 billion in tax revenues from the North Sea. It has all been
swallowed by the huge, mounting cost of mass unemployment. And the oil
won't last for ever, although, according to Mrs. Thatcher's economics, the
unemployment will.

Our country, no civilised country, can afford the human waste, the industrial
and economic waste, involved in these policies. We in the Labour Party

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 1 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

reject them absolutely, and we describe in this Manifesto the real
constructive alternative, and how we shall pay for it.

See, first, our Emergency Programme of Action to be started immediately
we are given the power. Most of these measures are designed to start the
drive for expansion, and the cost of them has been added up. How fast can
the country escape for the present stagnant rut?

That is the real question.

Just a week before Sir Geoffrey Howe, the Tory Chancellor, produced his
last Budget to keep us in the rut, Peter Shore, Labour's Shadow Chancellor,
produced his budget for expansion.

The costs he set out - an £11 billion expansion - would cover, as they were
designed to cover, the items we have listed in the Emergency Programme,
the promises we have tabulated.

So little is it true that Labour has not counted the cost. No party in
opposition has ever stated its intentions so clearly and comprehensively.

Then what happens? What happens after the first expansion is launched?
Here in these pages we describe the conditions for success, the pace we can
move forward, how that will depend on the response we can secure from all
sections of the community, on the partnership we have established with the
trade unions. Without that continuing partnership to rebuild our country, all
else will fail. True enough; but Labour is the only party which has worked
for this partnership and pledges it for the future.

And where will the money come from? Some of it will come from those oil
revenues now pouring down the drain. Some of it will come from the
billions we waste on the dole queues. Some of it will come from the billions
now being allowed to be exported in investment abroad.

Yes, and some of it will be borrowed, Mrs. Thatcher's dirty word.

But borrowing in that sense is what every intelligent government since the
war in Britain has done - including even Conservative governments.
Borrowing in that sense is what has been done by other governments in this
world slump who have kept their unemployment much lower than ours - and
their inflation rates low too.

Of course the slump can be beaten, if we have the will and the right policies.
The European governments which have survived it best have been mostly
socialist governments rejecting Thatcherite nostrums. And the whole wider
experience of the Western world since 1945 proves what can be done when
governments set before them full employment as a target. Is it truly realistic
and practical to cast all that knowledge aside?

It is just not true that mass unemployment must be accepted.
Rather, if nothing can be done about unemployment, nothing truly enduring

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

can be done about anything else. Allow it to persist and it will corrode the
rest of our society. It will make more deeply endemic than ever the
injustices, the bitter hardships, which afflict so many of our people.

So let's put a stop to defeatism, and put a stop too to all those sermons about
Victorian values. The labour movement - the Labour Party and the trade
unions acting together - came into being, as one of our poets, Idris Davies,
said, to end ""the long Victorian night"". It was a fight to introduce civilised
standards into the world of ruthless, devil-take-the-hindmost individualism.

Particularly after our 1945 victory, when Labour had a majority, we set to
work creating a real community in which the strong would come to the aid
of the weak, in which the profit test would have to make way for the human
test.

It was the Labour Party which created - to take just one example - the
National Health Service, in the teeth of bitter Tory opposition. Labour will
come to the rescue of that service and make it worthy of those who founded
it, those who serve it, and the patients who need it most of all. It is a
commonsense example of democratic socialism in action.

Of course, we know that the full work of rebuilding will not be easy. Of
course we know that, thanks to world conditions and the Conservative years
of destruction and decay, our task is made much harder.

But the programme of socialist reconstruction outlined in these pages, can be
carried through if a Labour government commands the support of the other
great democratic institutions in the land - in particular the local authorities
and the trade unions.

Labour is the only party which desires and can secure the working
partnership between the government and the trade unions essential to
national recovery.

Above all, the new Labour government will play a much more ambitious
part in helping to guide the nation towards peace, and, as an essential part of
the process, in establishing a sensible defence policy for our country.

One bunch of smears and scares with which Tory propagandists have already
disfigured this election campaign suggests that the Labour Party proposes to
throw away our defences, to abandon our alliances.

It is just not true. And it should not be forgotten that one of the last acts of
Mrs. Thatcher's government was to stop the debate in the House of
Commons when these slanders could have been nailed.

What we do propose to do is to get rid of the nuclear boomerangs which
offer no genuine protection to our people but, first and foremost, to help stop
the nuclear arms race which is the most dangerous threat to us all.

One of the most wretched features of the present government's record has
been the low interest they have devoted to the work of securing international

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 53

disarmament. No British initiative of any significance in this field has been
taken.

Instead, the programme for establishing American-controlled Cruise missiles
on our soil has been accepted without question, and the Trident programme
for the expansion of the British-controlled nuclear forces has been accepted
without reference to the possibilities of disarmament.

Indeed, the logic of the case for the nuclear deterrent, presented by British
Conservative Ministers, is that all peace-loving countries should equip
themselves with the same protection. It is a logic which would intensify the
race and destroy the universe.

The first task of a new Labour government will be to restore a sense of
sanity in dealing with these supreme questions. We offer a combined
programme of action by this country and of action in association with other
countries.

We are the only party that offers such a programme to meet the scale of the
challenge. We are the only party that offers a non-nuclear defence policy.

But we are not alone in our plans and our aspirations. Multitudes of people
in many other lands, on both sides of the Atlantic, in Asia and Africa and
Europe too, are ready to join us in the campaign for a nuclear freeze, for
fresh exertions to stop the proliferation of these weapons, to stop the whole
monstrous nuclear race to destruction.

Michael Foot

In this campaign document we set out Labour's alternative to mass
unemployment. We explain how a Labour government will help to stop the
nuclear arms race. We provide a radical programme of action, for a full, five-
year parliament, to save British industry and rebuild the welfare state.

The years of Tory failure

When the Tories took office in May 1979, unemployment was falling and the
economy growing. Living standards had gone up by a sixth in two years, and
North Sea oil held out the prospect of economic growth, high levels of
employment and better social services.

All this was thrown away by the Tories. Nearly three and a quarter million
men and women are now out of work, even on the official count. Plant after
plant forced to close. Manufacturing production down by a fifth. Investment
cut by a third. Our domestic markets captured by imports of manufactured
goods.

After four years of Mrs. Thatcher, Britain is a poorer country. We have fared
far worse than any other major industrial country. The unprecedented
advantage of North Sea oil and gas - worth, in tax revenues alone, 8p in the
pound on income tax - has been squandered, with nothing whatsoever to

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

show for it.

What have all these sacrifices achieved? Our economy today is weaker, not
stronger, than in 1979. There is no prospect of real economic growth.
Indeed, the Tories no longer dare to predict when unemployment will begin
to fall. True enough, inflation, after being forced to record levels by the
Tories, has been brought down. But look at the cost in jobs, in poorer
housing, in living standards, and in lost opportunities for our youth. And
now inflation is set to increase again, with interest rates and mortgage rates
likely to rise too.

The legacy of four Tory years goes beyond unemployment and industrial
decline; beyond the damage done to our social services; beyond even the
dangerous commitment to new nuclear weapons. It is expressed in the deep
sense of bitterness, distrust and despair now felt among so many sections of
the community. Our task will be to heal these wounds and rekindle among
the British people a new sense of unity and common purpose.

Emergency programme of action

Within days of taking office, Labour will begin to implement an emergency
programme of action, to bring about a complete change of direction for
Britain. Our priority will be to create jobs and give a new urgency to the
struggle for peace. In many cases we will be able to act immediately. In
others, which involve legislation, they will take longer to bring into effect.
But in all cases we shall act swiftly and with determination.

This is what we plan to do. We will:

¢ Launch a massive programme for expansion.We will:

© Provide a major increase in public investment, including
transport, housing and energy conservation.

© Begin a huge programme of construction, so that we can start to
build our way out of the slump.

© Halt the destruction of our social services and begin to rebuild
them, by providing a substantial increase in resources.

© Increase investment in industry, especially in new technology -
with public enterprise taking the lead. And we will steer new
industry and jobs to the regions and the inner cities.

o Ensure that the pound is competitive; and hold back prices
through action on VAT, rents, rates and fares.

o Introduce a crash programme of employment and training, with
new job subsidies and allowances.

¢ Begin to rebuild British industry, working within a new framework
for planning and industrial democracy. We will:

o Agree a new national economic assessment, setting out the
prospects for growth in the economy.

o Prepare a five-year national plan, in consultation with unions
and employers. Back up these steps with a new National
Investment Bank, new industrial powers, and a new Department

for Economic and Industrial Planning.

© Repeal Tory legislation on industrial relations and make
provision for introducing industrial democracy.

o Begin the return to public ownership of those public industries
sold off by the Tories.

e Start to create a fairer Britain, with decent social services for all.
We will:

© Raise child benefits by £2 a week, and give special help to one-
parent families and families with disabled dependants.

o Uprate the pension in November 1983 by the full amount
needed to protect against inflation; and increase pensions by
£1.45 a week for a single person and £2.25 for a married couple.

© Provide more resources for the health service with an increase
of at least 3 per cent a year in real terms.

o Improve the personal social services, such as meals on wheels
and home helps, with an increase of at least 4 per cent a year in
real terms.

o Spend more on education, including on essential books and
equipment; end the assisted places scheme; and stop selection in
secondary schools.

© Begin to develop comprehensive care for the under-fives.

o Begin to develop a strategy to eliminate low pay.

¢ Introduce positive action programmes to promote women's rights
and opportunities, and appoint a cabinet minister to promote equality
between the sexes. We will:

© Strengthen the Equal Pay Act and the Sex Discrimination Act.

o Improve child care and other social services.

o Take steps to end discrimination in education and training.

o Reverse Tory cuts in maternity rights.

o Increase the maternity grant.

¢ Encourage and assist local authorities to begin a massive programme
of house-building and improvement, through an immediate 50 per
cent increase in their housing investment programmes. Priority will go
to the urgent repair and replacement of run-down estates. We will
freeze all rents for the first full year.

¢ Begin a major programme to stop the waste of energy. We will stop
Sizewell and abandon the Tory PWR programme; and open urgent
discussions, with the unions and management in the coal industry, on a
new Plan for Coal.

¢ Give more help to public transport, with funds to improve services,
keep down fares, and increase investment - especially in rail
electrification and better freight facilities. Councils will be given new
powers to support local services.

¢ Act to improve the environment and deal with pollution - including
a ban on lead in petrol. An urgent start will be made on improving our
inner cities, including action on derelict land and buildings.

« Introduce a positive action programme for the ethnic minorities. We
will also introduce citizenship and immigration laws which do not
discriminate against either women or black and Asian Britons.

¢ Give a new priority to open government at local and national levels,

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

and give local communities greater freedom to manage their own
affairs. We will also introduce an early Bill to abolish the legislative
powers of the House of Lords.

¢ In international policy, we shall take new initiatives to promote
peace and development. We will:

o Cancel the Trident programme, refuse to deploy Cruise missiles
and begin discussions for the removal of nuclear bases from
Britain, which is to be completed within the lifetime of the
Labour government.

o Ban arms sales to repressive regimes.

© Increase aid to developing countries towards the UN target of
0.7 per cent.

© Re-establish a separate Ministry of Overseas Development.

o Take action to protect the status of refugees in Britain.

e We will also open immediate negotiations with our EEC partners, and
introduce the necessary legislation, to prepare for Britain's
withdrawal from the EEC, to be completed well within the lifetime
of the Labour government.

A five-year programme

Labour's emergency programme of action will get Britain on the road to
recovery. But on its own it will not be enough to establish a fairer, more
prosperous, more caring Britain.

The programme we set out in the pages which follow is, therefore, for a full,
five-year term of office. Clearly, we cannot do everything at once. The
economy has been dangerously weakened by the Tories, and Britain is
considerably poorer than when we were last in government. The world
recession could hamper our plans for economic revival.

Moreover, our proposals add up to a considerable increase in public
spending. Our programme is thus heavily dependent upon the achievement
of our basic objectives: namely, a large and sustained increase in the nation's
output and income and a matching decline in the numbers out of work. It is
this that will make the resources available for higher public spending
programmes and cut the enormous cost of unemployment. Even so, some of
our commitments will be phased in over a number of years. At each stage,
clearly, we shall have to choose carefully our priorities.

Ending mass unemployment

The present hideous level of unemployment is not an accident It is the direct
result of the policies of this government. The Tories have cut public
investment and services, and increased taxes, taking spending power out of
the economy and destroying jobs in both public and private sectors alike.
They have forced up interest rates and kept the pound too high - a
combination that has crippled British industry, and helped lose us markets at
home and abroad.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 13:26

Page 7 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

Our approach is different. We will expand the economy, by providing a
strong and measured increase in spending. Spending money creates jobs.
Money spent on railway electrification means jobs, not only in construction,
but also in the industries that supply the equipment - as well as faster and
better trains. If we increase pensions and child benefits, it means more
spending power for the elderly and for parents, more bought in shops, more
orders for goods, and more jobs in the factories. More spending means that
the economy will begin to expand: and growth will provide the new wealth
for higher wages and better living standards, the right climate for industry to
invest, and more resources for the public services.

Our central aim will be to reduce unemployment to below a million within
five years of taking office. We recognise the enormous scale of this task.
When we set this as our target, unemployment was 2.8 million, according to
the official figures. On this basis it is now at least 3.2 million. Our target will
thus be all the more difficult to achieve. It remains, however, the central
objective of our economic policy.

To achieve it we will need five years of economic growth, with a Labour
government carrying through all of the industrial, financial and economic
policies outlined here. But we will also work with other governments -
especially socialist governments - to bring about a co-ordinated expansion of
our economies.

Economic expansion will make it possible to end the waste of mass
unemployment. But it will also reduce the human costs of unemployment -
the poverty, the broken homes, the increase in illness and suicides. And it
will provide the resources we need to increase social spending, as we must,
at least in line with the growth of the economy.

How will we pay for it?

Given our commitment to increase public spending, it is right that people
should ask: how will we pay for it?

It would be wrong to finance the initial boost to spending by increasing
taxation. Only if ours was a fully employed economy would this be the right
way of doing it. But our economy today is chronically under-employed. We
have people out of work, idle plant, and unused savings. To finance
expansion by increasing taxation in these circumstances would be wrong.
For the increased spending in one part of the economy would be cancelled
out by decreased expenditure elsewhere. Of course, once the economy gets
much nearer to full employment, some taxes will have to be increased, both
to shift the tax balance towards those who can best afford to pay, and to help
finance our social programme.

Like any other expanding industrial enterprise, we shall borrow to finance
our programme of investment. This is better than borrowing, as the Tories
are doing, in order to pay for the dole queue or to provide finance for the
Argentine government to buy arms.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

There is no shortage of savings in the country available for borrowing today.
Indeed, vast amounts of British money - more than the government's total
borrowing requirement last year - are flowing into overseas investment. For
with our present slump, there is not the demand for investment here.

But the scale of borrowing will not be nearly as great as the increase in
spending. Spending generates new income and new savings. As the
economy recovers we shall be able to spend less on keeping people
unemployed. And when people get jobs they will also pay income tax and
spend more on goods which are taxed. Last year benefit payments, and tax
revenues foregone - because of unemployment - cost the nation some
£17,000 million. There are also important savings to be made by cancelling
the present government 5 massive expenditure programmes on Trident and
on PWR nuclear reactors.

Working together

At the heart of our programme is Labour's new partnership with the trade
unions. Our policies have been worked out with them. The Tories take pride
in rejecting any chance of constructive co-operation with the trade unions.
But it is the nation that has paid the price - the economy in ruins, and
industrial relations a battlefield. We believe that there is a better way: to
harness the goodwill and co-operation of working people and to work
together to create a better life for all.

Our starting point in government will be to discuss and agree with the trade
unions a national economic assessment, as described in our joint statement
with the TUC, Partners in Rebuilding Britain. This will set out the likely
growth in the national output and how it could be shared. It will cover the
allocation of resources, and the distribution of income between profits,
earnings from employment, rents, social benefits and other incomes. It will
also take into account our policies on the redistribution of income and
wealth, not least through the reform of taxation. It will take a view on what
changes in costs and prices would be compatible with our economic and
social objectives, and help to ensure that our plan for expansion is not
undermined by inflation. We will not, however, return to the old policies of
government-imposed wage restraint. The assessment will thus play a crucial
part in our national plan.

The assessment will also play an important role in Labour's plans for the
redistribution of wealth and power in our society. For, as we emphasise in
Labour's Programme, our aim is nothing less than to bring about 'a
fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in
favour of working people and their families'.

An offensive against low pay
The next Labour government will launch an offensive against low pay as

part of our strategy for equality. The problem of low pay remains acute both
in relative and absolute terms. If low pay at present is defined as less than

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

two-thirds of average male manual earnings, there were 3 million full-time
low-paid workers in 1982, of whom over 2 million were women workers.
Adding to these figures young workers, part-time workers and homeworkers
produces a total in the region of almost 6 million - a great majority of whom
are women.

We will work together with the unions to tackle low pay and extend the
concept of fair wages and arbitration. We will strengthen the Equal Pay Act.
We strongly emphasise the principles of fairness and proper comparability,
and will ensure machinery is available for the trade unions to establish these

principles. We will also discuss with the TUC the possibility of introducing a

minimum wage.
Industrial democracy

Industrial democracy is vital to the success of the national plan. We believe
that working people must have clear and definite rights to a say in running
their firms - and to an influence in economic planning. We will give new
statutory rights to workers - through their trade unions - on information,
consultation and representation within their companies. These are described
in our joint statement with the TUC, Economic Planning and Industrial
Democracy. But we will work out with the unions concerned what this
means for the individual industries and firms.

We will repeal the divisive Tory 'employment' laws and provide new
statutory support for collective bargaining. We will also give proper
employment protection to women and to homeworkers, part-time workers
and temporary workers.

The Tories' cut-backs in the work of the Health and Safety Commission will
be reversed. Labour will actively support the commission and the role of
joint safety committees in the work place.

Safeguards for expansion

Increased spending will not be enough to ensure sustained economic growth.
Spending will not create jobs if it is soaked up by imports. We must not
allow firms to use a return to growth as an excuse to put up prices. It will, in
addition, be essential to co-ordinate expansion so proper investment is made
for the future.

First, we will see that our financial and monetary policies support expansion.

We will make sure that public borrowing is financed, through the financial
institutions and national savings, without disruptive or damaging changes in
interest rates.

Second, exchange controls - maintained by successive British governments
since 1939; and so foolishly scrapped by the Tories in 1979 - will be re-
introduced. This will help to counter currency speculation and to make
available - to industry and government in Britain - the large capital resources

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 13:26

Page 10 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

that are now flowing overseas.

Third, we must ensure that our trade and balance of payments contribute to
our expansion. This means maintaining the pound at a realistic and
competitive rate. Tory monetary policies have kept interest rates far too high,
pushing the pound beyond its competitive value. An overpriced pound taxes
exports and subsidises imports. Our balance of trade, other than North Sea
oil, has been seriously damaged as a result. A competitive exchange rate will
assist British exports abroad and make British goods more competitive at
home.

A policy for imports

But we must also plan ahead so that, as the economy expands, we keep our
exports and imports in balance. We must therefore be ready to act on imports
directly: first, in order to safeguard key industries that have been seriously
put at risk by Tory policy; and second, so as to check the growth of imports
should they threaten to outstrip our exports and thus our plan for expansion.
We will:

¢ Use agreed development plans, which we shall negotiate with the
large companies that dominate our economy, so as to influence their
purchasing and development policies. Our aim will be to prevent
excessive import penetration and promote our own exports.

¢ Use public purchasing policy to help support our strategy.

¢ Introduce back-up import controls, using tariffs and quotas, if these
prove necessary, to achieve our objective of trade balance - upon
which sustained expansion depends.

Our purpose in trade policy is not to reduce trade but to make possible an
orderly expansion of imports, paid for by our growing export trade. We will
thus be able to replace the present policies of deflation, which restrict world
trade, by policies of expansion, which increase world trade. We will also
encourage international action for expansion and increased world trade.

Within the framework of an orderly expansion of trade, we will also seek to
give real preferences to imports from developing countries, particularly from
the poorest countries, except where this will create acute problems for
particular industries in this country.

Prices - controlling inflation

The Tories have used mass unemployment to control inflation. We
completely reject this approach. We believe it is madness to keep people out
of work deliberately. Our priority will be to expand the economy and create
jobs. But we are also determined to prevent soaring prices. Expansion will in
itself help cut the costs of production and therefore hold back prices. But we
will use other measures to help restrain inflation. We will:

¢ Use direct measures of price restraint, such as cutting VAT, and

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

subsidies on basic products, to cut into inflation as and when
necessary.

« Stop using public sector charges, such as gas prices - up by 116 per
cent since 1979 - as a back-door way of raising taxes, as the Tories
have done.

¢ Buy our food where it is cheaper, on world markets, following
Britain's withdrawal from the EEC.

¢ Give powers to a new Price Commission to investigate companies,
monitor price increases and order price freezes and reductions. These
controls will be closely linked to our industrial planning, through
agreed development plans with the leading, price-setting firms.

¢ Take full account of these measures in the national economic
assessment, to be agreed each year with the trade unions. The
assessment will also take account of the impact of cost increases on
the future rate of inflation.

Value for money

The Tories say that 'competition' ensures that shoppers get a fair deal. The
customers know better. Stronger legal safeguards are essential to protect
customers - not least from shoddy goods. And shoppers must know their
rights and be able to enforce them. We will undertake an urgent and
comprehensive review of consumer law and reform it. We will also bring in
new safeguards on advertising. We will:

e Establish a major public service facility - a Product Research Unit - to
test products and manufacturers' claims about them, and to publicise
the results widely.

e Set up consumer advice centres in all main shopping centres, with
mobile units for rural areas.

¢ Provide simple court procedures for small claims, stronger trade codes
of practice placed on to a statutory basis, and adequate penalties for
trading offences.

¢ See that all public enterprises give a high priority to dealing with
consumer complaints and needs - and back them with stronger
consumer councils.

¢ Introduce a code of advertising practice, on a statutory basis, to be
administered by the office of Fair Trading; and provide powers to
order advertisements to be substantiated, withdrawn, or corrected with
equal prominence.

Rebuilding our industry

The Tories have been a disaster for British industry. Plants and companies
have closed, skilled workers have been laid off, markets at home and abroad
have been lost to our competitors. Industry has not invested enough, and it
has failed to develop and exploit the new technologies as successfully as
other industrial countries.

We must rebuild our industrial strength - and we can do so under a Labour

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

Government working together with unions and managers, to plan Britain's
industrial development. Our aim is not just to save companies and factories
from closing down. We intend to create new companies and new science-
based industries - using new public enterprise to lead the way, and supported
by the development of industrial democracy.

In our joint statement with the TUC, Economic Planning and Industrial
Democracy, and in Labour's Programme 1982, we show how it can be done.
We will:

¢ Develop a new five-year national plan to coordinate expansion and
public spending with plans for individual industries and regions. We
will create a powerful new Department of Economic and Industrial
Planning.

e Involve the trade unions and management in planning at every level
with a new, tripartite National Planning Council.

e Link planning at all levels firmly to a radical extension of industrial
democracy. New statutory rights will enable workers to draw up plans
for their own enterprises and sectors of industry, which we will seek to
incorporate into our strategy.

e Make our planning flexible, so that it is able to respond quickly to
changing circumstances and take full account of changing needs and
preferences. We are opposed to any kind of rigid planning from the
centre. But we will seek to develop a firm sense of strategic direction.

¢ Negotiate agreed development plans with all leading companies -
national and multinational, public and private - so that such companies
play a constructive role in supporting the national plan and our plans
for individual regions and sectors.

¢ Support these agreed development plans with new industrial powers,
including discretionary price controls, financial support and access to
credit; and take powers to invest in individual companies, to purchase
them outright or to assume temporary control.

¢ Monitor closely the activities of multinational companies, through a
Foreign Investment Unit. All UK-based multinationals will have to
operate within clearly laid-down guidelines.

e Develop regional development plans, with plans also being drawn up
at local level by local authorities. Regional development agencies will
be established, extending our present commitment to a Northern
Development Agency to other English regions in need of them. These
agencies will have similar powers and resources to those in Scotland
and Wales. We will also consider using new regional job subsidies.

¢ Strengthen the NEB, the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies,
and the Industrial Development Board in Northern Ireland. We will
give them, and the new development agencies, adequate resources for
investment and acquisition.

We will use public and co-operative enterprise to support our planning and
as a major source of technical innovation. We will:

¢ Encourage and help existing public enterprises to expand and
diversify. They will be given far more freedom to raise funds on

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

capital markets.

¢ Return to public ownership the public assets and rights hived off by
the Tories, with compensation of no more than that received when the
assets were denationalised. We will establish a significant public stake
in electronics, pharmaceuticals, health equipment and building
materials; and also in other important sectors, as required in the
national interest.

¢ Give generous encouragement and help to worker co-operatives and
local enterprise boards. We will establish a Co-operative Investment
Bank. The development agencies and local authorities will be
empowered to support and to help establish co operatives and local
enterprise boards. We will give new rights to workers to convert their
firms into co-operatives.

Labour will also support key industries in the public sector. We will:

e Prevent the further decline of both public and private sectors of the
steel industry so that the industry can, through planned investment,
meet the rising demand from economic expansion. We will retain the
five major BSC plants and see that a larger share of the home market
is met from UK production. A major public presence will also be
established in the steel stock-holding industry.

* Develop our aerospace industries. We will ensure that proper levels
of research, development and investment take place, and that the
industries have the capacity and skills needed to compete as equals in
the world market. The British Aerospace Corporation will be re-
established as a major public enterprise.

e Support the shipbuilding industry, which is vital for a maritime
nation such as Britain, with interests in merchant shipping, the Navy,
offshore oil and gas resources and fishing. Labour will establish a
maritime strategy embracing both shipbuilding and shipping interests.
We will re establish the British Shipbuilding Corporation as a public
sector company with a new financial basis and adequate resources for
investment.

Telecommunications

A national cable system will make possible a wide range of new
telecommunications services, greater variety in the provision of television,
and a major stimulus to British technology and industry. But it must be
under firm public control. A publicly-owned British Telecommunications
will thus be given the sole responsibility to create a national, broadband
network (including Mercury, the new privately-owned telecommunications
system for business), which integrates telecommunications and broadcasting.

Science and technology

Science and technology are essential to Britain's economic and social
regeneration. The Tories have undermined research and development in the
science-based research industries of the future. Cuts in higher education

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 14 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

threaten our fundamental research. Industry devotes less to research and
development than any other of our major industrial competitors. Defence
accounts for over 80 per cent of government research funds in industry.

The fall in output, together with the lack of planning and retraining, has
meant that new technology has brought major job losses in some sectors.
Only Labour can plan new technology to meet our commitment to full
employment. We will:

¢ Guarantee adequate funding for higher education, the research
councils and government research establishments.

e Use the National Investment Bank to channel funds from the financial
institutions into long-term investment in new technology.

e Work together with trade unions to plan an expansion of new
technology, in particular using it to aid a product-based recovery of the
economy. New technology agreements, for proper safeguards and
retraining for the work-force, will be extended.

¢ Strengthen the links between research by higher education and
industry to help greater industrial innovation.

¢ Increase technological literacy in schools and give boys and girls
equal opportunities to study science and technology.

¢ Promote the supply of engineers and technicians, including women, to
meet the needs of industry and the community.

¢ Ensure that research and development are directed towards society's
needs, with a reduction in the present high proportion of defence
research.

¢ Promote the development and use of new information and
communication services to support a wider democracy.

Finance for industry

It is essential that industry has the finance it needs to support our plans for
increased investment. Our proposals are set out in full in our Conference
statement, The Financial Institutions. We will:

¢ Establish a National Investment Bank to put new resources from
private institutions and from the government - including North Sea oil
revenues - on a large scale into our industrial priorities. The bank will
attract and channel savings, by agreement, in a way that guarantees
these savings and improves the quality of investment in the UK.

e Exercise, through the Bank of England, much closer direct control
over bank lending. Agreed development plans will be concluded with
the banks and other financial institutions.

¢ Create a public bank operating through post offices, by merging the
National Girobank, National Savings Bank and the Paymaster
General's Office.

e Set up a Securities Commission to regulate the institutions and
markets of the City, including Lloyds, within a clear statutory
framework.

e Introduce a new Pension Schemes Act to strengthen members' rights

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 15 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

in occupational pension schemes, clarify the role of trustees, and give
members a right to equal representation, through their trade unions, on
controlling bodies of the schemes.

¢ Set up a tripartite investment monitoring agency to advise trustees and
encourage improvements in investment practices and strategies.

We expect the major clearing banks to co operate with us fully on these
reforms, in the national interest. However, should they fail to do so, we shall
stand ready to take one or more of them into public ownership. This will not
in any way affect the integrity of customers’ deposits.

Employment and training

The long-term unemployed - the men and women who have suffered most
from the Tory onslaught - will benefit directly from economic expansion and
our policies on regional development. But special measures are also needed.
By the end of our first five years, our aim is that no-one will be out of work
for more than a year without receiving an offer of a job or training place.

We will act quickly to save jobs and stop the further destruction of industry.
We will expand the schemes for compensating firms that avoid redundancy
and provide temporary jobs for the long-term unemployed. We will widen
the Job Release Scheme and offer employment subsidies to firms, linked to
agreements with them to preserve and create jobs. We will also provide
major increases in youth and adult training, with special provision for
women, ethnic minorities and the disabled; and integrate a reformed Youth
Training Scheme into our scheme for a two-year student-traineeship.

Industry has been badly hit by the collapse of training under the Tories.
Expansion must not be held back by shortages of skilled labour; and people
without work must have the skills needed to take up the available jobs. We
will:

¢ Introduce a new statutory framework, linking adult training with
initial training. This will also place a statutory duty on employers to
carry out training and establish joint workplace training committees.
Adequate funds will be provided jointly by industry and government.

¢ Give the Manpower Services Commission the authority and resources
it needs to do the job. The commission will develop its regional and
local structures, advise companies on their plans for manpower, and
get advance notice of redundancies.

e Ensure that the MSC develops a national job centre network and
reverses the cutbacks in occupational guidance and help for
disadvantaged job seekers. We will take urgent steps to abolish private
employment agencies.

Working time in Britain, over the life time of individual workers, is among
the highest in industrial countries. We will work through collective
bargaining to reduce working time; and this will include more flexible
working arrangements, more time off for study, longer holidays, earlier

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

voluntary retirement with adequate pensions - with progress towards our aim
of a common pension age of 60 - and a 35 hour week.

Equal rights at work

Labour's aim is to create equal rights at work for women and to overcome
the effects of past discrimination. We will:

e Expand Positive Action Programmes to eliminate discrimination,
change employment practices and introduce special training schemes
to equip women to enter non-traditional areas of work.

¢ Carry out these programmes throughout the public sector, ensure that
public-sector contracts include a commitment to positive action, and
press employers and unions to negotiate these programmes through
joint equal opportunities committees at the workplace. These
proposals will be backed, if necessary, by a statutory duty on
employers.

¢ Strengthen the Sex Discrimination and Equal Pay Acts to make them
more effective. We will shift the burden of proof from the complainant
to the alleged discriminator, incorporate the concept of indirect
discrimination and introduce the principle of equal pay for work of
equal value.

e End the distinction between part-time and full-time workers in terms
of rights, hourly pay-rates and conditions, and extend greater
employment protection to homeworkers and women on maternity
leave.

We also aim to create equality of opportunity and treatment for black
workers, and similar positive action programmes will be carried through on
their behalf.

Energy

Energy is vital to our future as an industrial nation. We will plan its supply
and demand more carefully and save more of the energy we use. As outlined
in Labour's Programme 1982, we will:

e Ensure that everyone can afford adequate heat and light at home.

¢ Give priority to the coal industry and the use of coal as a fuel. We will
seek to re-establish the tripartite machinery set up under Labour and
prepare a new Plan for Coal. We will also replace old plant with coal-
fired stations.

¢ Assist major towns and cities to set up combined heat and power
schemes.

¢ Begin a massive conservation programme, led by insulation for
council housing, and giving incentives to industry on agreed plans to
save energy. The programme will be managed by a new Energy
Conservation Agency.

¢ Greatly increase spending on the development of renewable sources.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

¢ Stop Sizewell and scrap the Tory PWR programme. The need for a
continuing nuclear programme based on the British AGR will be
reassessed when we come to office.

¢ Re-establish the Energy Commission to advise on the preparation and
annual review of a comprehensive energy plan.

e Transfer the whole of the National Nuclear Corporation to the public
sector.

Energy costs now represent a major part of family budgets. We will aim to
reduce these costs, both by conservation and by introducing new fuel
allowances.

We will bring Britoil back into public ownership and combine it with BNOC
to create a powerful national oil corporation with full powers to engage in all
aspects of oil-related activities. We will restore to the new corporation a
minimum 50 per cent stake in all fields discovered since 1975; and, in line
with our objective to bring North Sea oil into public ownership and control,
the public sector will have the dominant role in all future oil and gas
exploration and development in the North Sea. We reaffirm our commitment
to achieving full public control and ownership of British Petroleum, in order
to make it an effective agent of a nationally directed oil policy.

Food, fishing and agriculture

Britain needs a food and agriculture policy much more in line with our needs
- and this is one of the prime reasons for leaving the EEC. Instead of the
inflated prices of the EEC's Common Agricultural Policy, we will support
our agriculture through deficiency payments - coupled, where necessary,
with limited intervention buying and direct income support.

As we describe in Labour's Programme 1982, we will conduct an 'annual
assessment of the industry, after consultation with all those concerned. This
will set the level of support given to the industry. Labour will also negotiate
long-term supply agreements with agricultural producing nations; establish
commodity agencies and support marketing co-operatives; and, where
helpful, extend marketing boards to other sectors.

Together with the trade unions we will work to close the gap between
agricultural and industrial earnings, and replace the Agricultural Wages
Board with a statutory joint industrial council. We will also act to improve
farm safety, provide statutory support for workers' safety representatives,
and end pay discrimination against women workers.

We will give a new deal to the fishing industry. We will draw up a National
Fisheries Plan so as to take full advantage of our withdrawal from the EEC.
We will also provide public investment for the industry and improved
conditions of employment - including safety conditions - and introduce a
licensing system for registered fishing vessels and fishermen.

We will end the de-rating of agricultural land. We will also defend the

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 18 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

agricultural environment by giving a new priority to the effect on the
environment of our agricultural policies. We will make all agricultural aid
subject to environmental criteria and extend development controls to
agriculture.

We shall take tougher measures to control the use of pesticides and
herbicides. We shall establish a body with statutory powers to supervise their
use, and in particular we shall ban the use of 245-T. We shall strengthen
controls on the use of additives in feedstuffs, and in food, and ensure better
labelling. Our aim is to make it easier for new entrants, such as young
farmers, to come into the industry and obtain a tenancy. We will do this with
the help of a new Rural Land Authority, which will administer rural land
already publicly-owned and begin to extend public ownership to tenanted
land.

For the forestry industry, we intend to reconstitute the Forestry
Commission, as described in Labour's Programme 1982, so that it operates
as an expanding public enterprise. The commission would cease to act as a
spokesman for the private sector; and it will be expected to extend its
activities to include the processing side of the industry. We will also seek to
increase tree plantings.

A better deal for women

Labour's objective is to achieve equality between women and men. Over half
the population are women; yet in our society, paid employment is seen as
important while domestic skills - involving caring for children - do not enjoy
their proper status. Women should have a genuine choice between staying at
home to look after the family or going to work. Men and women should be
able to share the rights and responsibilities of paid employment and
domestic activities, so that job segregation within and outside the home is
broken down.

Tory attacks on women's rights and opportunities have more than doubled
the numbers of unemployed women and destroyed services which women in
particular depend upon. Labour will do more than reverse these policies. We
will:

e Expand current positive action programmes as well as introduce wide-
ranging new schemes in order to encourage women to train and apply
for new job opportunities, particularly in the area of new technology.

¢ Provide equal pay for work of equal value by amending the Equal Pay
Act; and take action, together with the trade unions, against low pay.

¢ Strengthen the Sex Discrimination Act to include direct and indirect
discrimination on the grounds of family status, and shift the burden of
proof from the complainant to the alleged discriminator.

¢ Strengthen and expand the role of the Equal Opportunities
Commission.

¢ Restore and extend women's employment rights to include part-time
and home workers.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 19 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

¢ Reverse the Tory attack on employment, social services and maternity
rights.

¢ Improve the level of financial support to families with children and
disabled dependants. The household duties test will be abolished.
Extra help will be given to one-parent families.

¢ Establish an integrated system of child care with priority for children
in the most deprived areas. Our aim will be to introduce, as soon as
possible, a statutory duty on local authorities to provide nursery
education for all pre school children whose parents wish it.

¢ Take steps to end discrimination in education and training, as set out
in Labour's Programme 1982.

e Provide the resources to make a major improvement in the personal
social services for the care of elderly, sick and disabled people.

e Within the NHS, improve community services, extend preventive
measures including screening, and develop child health services.

e Increase the maternity grant to at least £100.

e Provide fair treatment for widows.

¢ Increase the death grant to at least £200.

¢ Work to establish equal treatment in tax and social security.

e End VAT on sanitary protection.

¢ Appoint a cabinet minister to promote equality between the sexes.

¢ Review the whole question of divorce and maintenance.

e Establish a fairer system of family law, and introduce Family Courts.

¢ Give more support for victims of rape; and provide an urgent review
of police and court procedures in cases of rape and violence against
women.

¢ Improve ante-natal and maternity services, and respect the wishes of
women in childbirth.

¢ Support the provision of family crisis centres and more refuges for
battered women.

While continuing to defend and respect the absolute right of individual
conscience, we will improve NHS facilities for family planning and
abortion, including counselling and day-care; and we will remove barriers to
the implementation of the existing right of choice for women in the
termination of a pregnancy.

Fair shares

Our plan for expansion must be supported by measures to create a fairer
Britain. We shall reform taxation so that the rich pay their full share and the
tax burden on the lower paid is reduced. By progressively increasing the real
value of the personal allowance, we will help the lower paid and those on
average earnings. We intend also to bring down the starting point of the
highest rates of tax, and to remove the present ceiling on earnings-related
National Insurance contributions.

In Labour's Programme 1982, we explain how we will reduce tax avoidance.

This will include action on family trusts and investment income. We also
intend to limit the open-ended availability to higher-rate tax payers of

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 20 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

various tax reliefs. A determined attack will be mounted on illegal tax
evasion.

We shall also reform indirect taxation. We will extend zero-rating under
VAT, with different rates for essentials and non-essentials.

Capital taxes will be used to reduce the huge inequalities in inherited wealth.
We shall reverse most of the Tories' concessions on capital transfer tax and
introduce a new annual tax on net personal wealth, along the lines set out in
Labour's Programme 1982. This will ensure that the richest 100,000 of the
population make a fair and proper contribution to tax revenue.

Helping families

Labour will give families a better deal. Our first priority will be to help
families with children in order to support them in the task of parenthood.
The Tories refuse to accept the wide variety in the type and size of families.
Their policies restrict choice for members of families - in particular they
reduce the freedom of men and women to choose whether to work or to stay
at home and look after their families. At the same time, Tory policy has
trapped more and more families in poverty through a combination of means-
tested benefits and a tax system which bites hardest on the lowest paid.

We aim to recast the tax and benefit system, so as to redistribute resources to
families with children. Our priority is child benefit. We will increase it by
£2.00 a week, make it index-linked, and subsequently improve it in real
terms, as resources allow. In the longer term, we shall aim to raise child
benefit to the level of child support given to those on long-term benefits. We
shall also restore the rights to weekly payment of child benefit; increase the
maternity grant to £100; and give extra help to one-parent families.

We shall continue to help family budgets throughout the parliament:

e By increasing personal tax allowances - thus taking the poorest
families out of the tax net;

¢ By making further increases in child benefit;

¢ By extending and improving the Invalid Care Allowance for those
who care for disabled people.

To help pay for these improvements we shall, over the lifetime of the
parliament, phase out the married man's additional tax allowance for those
under the age of retirement. Married couples with dependants will clearly
benefit considerably from these changes - whilst the overall change for those
without dependants, given the increases in personal allowance, will be small
in any one year. However, we recognise that the loss of the allowance could
cause financial difficulty for those couples where one of the spouses is not in
work. We shall therefore consider how best to give support to these married
couples where there are no dependants. Our aim is to end sex discrimination
in taxation. We favour the principle of separate taxation and are examining
how best to implement this.

A new deal for pensioners

We believe that elderly people, both today's pensioners as well as those who
will benefit in future from Labour's pension scheme, should share as of right
in our future prosperity. We shall:

¢ Uprate the pension in November 1983 by the full amount necessary to
protect its real value against the rise in inflation to that date.

¢ Increase pensions, as soon as practicable, by £1.45 for a single person
and £2.25 for a married couple. This is the amount pensioners have
lost through the Tories breaking the link between pensions and
earnings.

¢ Link pensions and average earnings, when these are rising faster than
prices, and extend this to all benefits.

e Make progress towards our aim of a common pension age of 60.

¢ Double the Christmas bonus to £20.

e Phase out the TV licence for pensioners, during the lifetime of the
Labour government.

« Give women the additional tax allowance for the elderly - the age
allowance - at 60 instead of 65.

¢ Increase the Death Grant to £200 and extend it to cover all deaths.

¢ Introduce a Pension Schemes Act that will more adequately protect
occupational pensions from the effects of inflation than they are at
present; protect the position of early leavers; and extend to members
of schemes, rights to participation and to greater information.

¢ Introduce, in areas where more favourable concessionary travel on
local transport does not exist, a nationwide, off-peak, half-fares
scheme for pensioners.

¢ Reform the harsh supplementary benefit rules introduced by the
Tories.

¢ Reduce energy costs, for pensioners, both through support for
conservation and by introducing new fuel allowances.

Help for the unemployed

Working people are entitled to a decent income when they lose their job
through circumstances beyond their control. An improved earnings-related
supplement will once again be paid during the first months of
unemployment. We shall end the discrimination whereby the unemployed
are not entitled to the long-term rate of supplementary benefit after a year.
We shall also consider how best to improve unemployment benefit for the
longer-term unemployed so that large-scale supplementation is not required.

Help for people with disabilities

The last Labour government established, for the first time, the basis for
eliminating poverty among disabled people. We intend to build on this. We
will:

e Introduce a £10 a week blindness allowance, as a first step towards the

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 22 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

introduction of a new cash benefit for disabled people, which will vary
according to the degree of disability.

¢ Bring up the non-contributory invalidity pension to the level of the
flat-rate contributory i nvalidity benefit, and restore the 5 per cent cut
in invalidity benefit.

¢ Help the many disabled people who are capable of working part-time
or for limited periods, but discouraged by present benefit regulations.
We shall amend these to take account of their needs.

¢ Abolish the household duties test for housewives' non-contributory
invalidity pension and extend invalid care allowance to all those
women presently excluded.

¢ Continue to pay mobility allowance to existing recipients as they
reach the age of 75.

e Ensure the full implementation of the Chronically Sick and Disabled
Persons Act.

¢ For those who require long-term care - elderly, mentally handicapped,
mentally ill and disabled people - develop services within both the
health service and the local authority services, based on support for
them and their families within the community.

¢ Make proper provision for the 20 per cent of children requiring
various forms of special education. We will promote and provide the
resources for the integration within mainstream schooling of those
children whose needs are best met by ordinary schools.

Labour will also aim to overcome discrimination against the disabled at
work. We will reverse the Tory cuts, which have caused unnecessary
suffering for people with disabilities. We shall increase the number of
disablement resettlement officers; extend capital grants to adapt employer's
premises; strengthen existing schemes - especially rehabilitation - to help
disabled people back to work; and introduce new legislation, including
quotas, to secure employment opportunities and job protection for disabled
people.

A fairer benefit system

The new supplementary benefit scheme introduced by the Tories is harsh and
unfair. We shall reform it. The families of those involved in industrial
disputes will be entitled to full benefits - less any strike pay actually paid.
We shall return to a sliding scale for assessing capital and the surrender
value of insurance policies will be excluded. The anomaly which prevents
some widows from claiming long-term supplementary benefit will be
removed. We shall give extra help to families with children.

We shall improve staffing levels and physical conditions in social security
offices so as to provide a more humane and responsive service for claimants.
Many people fail to claim benefit to which they are entitled. We shall aim to
increase take-up by improvements in publicity and the provision of advice.

All the social security changes made by the Tories, including the new sick
pay and housing benefit schemes, will be reviewed. If they do not treat

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 23 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

working people and their families fairly, we will replace them.

Forty years have elapsed since the Beveridge Report which led to the setting
up of the National Insurance scheme by the post war Labour government.
We shall conduct a thorough review of the scheme in the light of today's
circumstances.

The right to health care

The creation of the National Health Service is one of the greatest
achievements of the Labour Party. It now faces a double threat from the
Tories: a lack of resources for decent health care; and the active
encouragement of private practice. Labour will act to defend the basic
principles of the service. We will ensure that it is free at the point of use and
funded out of taxation, and that priority depends on medical need not ability

to pay.

To meet rising costs due to improved medical technology and the age
composition of the population, and to allow for a general expansion of our
under-funded health services, we shall increase health service expenditure by
3 per cent per annum in real terms. We will also seek a fairer distribution of
these resources at both regional and district level. Since the election,
prescription charges have increased from 20p to £1.40 per item. Labour will
phase out health charges. We shall also ensure that NHS staff receive a fair
reward for their work and dedication; and we will discuss with the TUC new
arrangements for pay determination and the resolution of disputes.

Our overriding aim will be to reduce inequalities in standards of health care
for all who need it. We will:

¢ Give greater emphasis to prevention, both within the health and
personal social services. We will come forward with proposals to help
prevent accidents and disease, including action on advertising.

¢ Give priority to improving our primary health care services, especially
in the inner cities.

¢ Continue to improve the ante-natal and maternity services and develop
our child health services; and we will respect the wishes of women in
child birth.

¢ Introduce an independent complaints system in both hospital and
family practitioner services.

e Recognise the importance of community health councils and ensure
that they have the power and facilities to represent fully the consumer
point of view.

e Abolish the special charges for overseas visitors, and end passport
checks.

e Take a major public stake in the pharmaceutical industry - and ensure
that the drugs available are safe, effective and economic.

The present expansion in private medicine is a serious threat to our priorities
in health care. We will not allow the development of a two-tier health

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 24 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

service, where the rich can jump the queue. We shall remove private practice
from the NHS and take into the NHS those parts of the profit-making private
sector which can be put to good use. We shall also stop public subsidies to
the private sector and prevent it expanding further. We will give proper
recognition to those consultants who make a full-time commitment to the
NHS; and we will provide incentives to those choosing to work in under-
doctored areas and specialities.

While continuing to defend and respect the absolute right of individual
conscience, we will improve NHS facilities for family planning and
abortion, including counselling and day-care; and we will remove barriers to
the implementation of the existing right of choice for women in the
termination of a pregnancy.

Personal social services

Personal social services - such as childcare, home helps, meals on wheels
and residential and day care for the elderly and handicapped, are a vital part
of our welfare state. And it is those who are most vulnerable in our society
who depend most upon them.

The Tory cuts in the social services have hit women hardest. They have
meant lost jobs for many women and a loss of support for the elderly and
disabled, thus forcing women to stay at home as unpaid carers. A major
improvement in personal social services will be necessary, not only to raise
the standard of living of those who depend upon them, but also to give
women an equal right to work. Labour will reverse the Tory cuts, improve
and expand services so that they can complement the much better
community health services we shall provide. This will involve increasing
spending by at least 4 per cent a year in real terms. We will:

¢ Increase joint finance and extend it to cover other agencies.

¢ Require social services departments to plan and develop services for
children jointly with education and health authorities.

¢ Strengthen the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act so that it
provides a Charter of Rights for disabled people everywhere.

¢ Require local authorities to develop preventive services for children at
risk.

¢ Give greater attention to the needs of ethnic minorities.

e Encourage the growth of local, independent advice and advocacy
services.

Education for the future

If individuals are to achieve their full creative potential, and our society is to
advance, we must substantially improve educational provision and
opportunity. The Tories' cuts have shown that they have no commitment to a
free and fair education system. The fact is, however, that economic and
social progress will depend on our success in making use of the abilities of
the whole of our population.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 25 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

For the under-fives, our goal is to achieve comprehensive provision, with
priorities for children in the most deprived areas. We will unify education
and care services for the under-fives, both nationally and locally. Our aim
will be to introduce a statutory duty on local authorities to provide nursery
education, as soon as possible, for all pre-school children whose parents
wish it.

Schools in the community

Primary education is fundamental to all educational and social development,
as any parent knows. We will restore funds to local education authorities to
reduce class sizes; and improve learning materials and facilities in primary
schools so that our children receive the best possible start in their schooling.

Secondary education is a period during which all young people must prepare
themselves as the workers and citizens of the future. We shall encourage a
higher standard of achievement among all pupils in the variety of academic
and other activities which are essential parts of fully comprehensive
education. We will:

¢ Repeal the Education Act 1979 and prohibit all forms of academic
selection, such as the eleven plus, as a condition of admission to
secondary schools.

¢ Require local education authorities to maintain a broad, balanced and
comprehensive curriculum, providing genuinely equal opportunities
for boys and girls, and for the ethnic minorities to meet the needs of
our multi-cultural society.

e Establish a common system of assessment for all 16 year olds which
will encourage effort and accurately record achievement at school.

Throughout the whole of schooling, we will:

e Determine a supply of appropriately qualified teachers to reduce class
sizes. No class size should be over 30. The quality and frequency of
teacher in-service training must be improved so that teachers receive
no less than one school term of training in every five years of service.

e Discuss with the local authorities ways of developing a reformed
system for funding education. Whilst safeguarding local democracy in
education, this must secure and maintain improved national standards
of provision in essential areas.

¢ Abolish corporal punishment; and help local authorities and schools to
develop other methods, already successfully practised in many
schools, for dealing with bad behaviour.

¢ Positively encourage parental understanding and participation in the
education of their children by increasing parental representation on
school governing bodies and increasing the links between home and
school.

¢ Re-establish the school meals and milk services, cut back by the
Tories. This will help to offset the inequalities, for example in
nutrition, highlighted by the Black Report.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 26 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

Private schools are a major obstacle to a free and fair education system, able
to serve the needs of the whole community. We will abolish the Assisted
Places Scheme and local authority place buying; and we will phase out, as
quickly as possible, boarding allowances paid to government personnel for
their children to attend private schools, whilst ensuring secure
accommodation for children needing residential education.

We shall also withdraw charitable status from private schools and all their
other public subsidies and tax privileges. We will also charge VAT on the
fees paid to such schools; phase out fee charging; and integrate private
schools within the local authority sector where necessary. Special schools for
handicapped pupils will retain all current support and tax advantages.

Post 16 education

For 16 and 17 year olds, we will introduce a two years' student-traineeship
within a third or 'tertiary', stage of education, as described in the section on
young people. A 'tertiary awards council' will be established to develop and
validate a proper system of educational assessment for the whole of the age
group. Our aim is to replace the rigid 'A' level system with a broader
programme of study within the student-traineeship, thus preventing over
specialisation and promoting flexibility and breadth in learning.

Our policy for education after eighteen is expansion with change. We will
reverse the Tory cuts and restore the right for all qualified young people
seeking higher education to secure places. We will also substantially expand
opportunities for adults in both further and higher education.

We reject the Tory proposals for student loans; and we will ensure students
are given adequate financial support. We will also provide proper financial
support for those on non-advanced, part-time advanced, and Open
University courses.

Adult education

We are determined to give priority to adults who have been denied
educational opportunity on leaving school. We will:

¢ Give statutory backing to paid educational leave for workers.

e Phase in a new, adult educational entitlement that will provide one
year of education, backed by financial support for adults who have
never received education after eighteen.

¢ Require educational institutions to be more flexible in their admissions
procedures and methods of study.

e Establish a proper legal basis for adult education; and create a
development council to promote adult and continuing education.

e Establish machinery to plan and co ordinate all post 18-education
together and ensure that the bodies funding universities, and planning
local authority further, higher and continuing education, are more
accountable and representative.

A new deal for young people

Labour will end the scourge of youth unemployment and prepare young
people to take up the jobs that we will create. We will also encourage all
young people in employment to join a trade union. Our radical new scheme
for young people will establish a new, two year student-traineeship for all 16
and 17 year olds. It will bring together, for the first time, the first years of
apprenticeships, other training schemes for young workers and the young
unemployed and courses in full-time education in schools and colleges. We
will:

¢ Give to young people who are at work the right to be released to
college or school, on full pay. Employers will be given a statutory duty
to provide opportunities for their young employees to receive
systematic education and training and to release student-trainees at
their request. Premiums will be paid to them to recruit young people
and provide them with such opportunities.

e Abolish the so-called Young Workers' Scheme, set up by the Tories to
reduce youth wages. Labour rejects completely the Tory argument that
young people have priced themselves out of jobs.

¢ Offer all young people without work a place on new youth training
schemes, with proper education and training opportunities - which can
best be guaranteed by active monitoring by the trade unions; and give
them an allowance of at least £30 per week - the level of which will be
agreed annually with the TUC - with trade unions being free to
negotiate better terms.

e Provide student-trainees, in full-time education, with an educational
maintenance allowance of £25 a week, at 1983 prices, covering 52
weeks in a year.

Labour will establish new rights and provide more resources for youth. We
will:

e Expand and improve the youth service so that it meets the social,
cultural and recreational needs of young people - especially the
unemployed, young women, the ethnic minorities and the young
disabled.

e Established a 'youth initiatives fund' to give greater recognition and
support to organisations which represent young people's interest.

¢ Encourage local authorities to support representative local youth
councils as one of the means of enabling young people to influence
public affairs as young adults.

e Expand funding and staffing for the provision of social studies and
education for citizenship in youth clubs and schools with the aim of
informing young people of their civil, political and trade union rights
and responsibilities as citizens. Accredited trade union representatives
should be involved with secondary school students in the context of
such education, with full facilities for such representatives at all career
days.

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

Homes for everyone

Britain faces a major housing crisis. The Tories have slashed public spending
on housing by half and house building is at its lowest since the 1920's.
Houses are falling into disrepair faster than they can be repaired, while
homelessness and waiting lists continue to grow. Labour will reverse this
decline. Our aim is a decent home for all with real freedom of choice
between renting and owning, on terms people can afford.

Labour governments have done more than any others to assist owner
occupiers; and we will extend this by giving special assistance to first-time
buyers and council tenants.

Labour will immediately increase by half the total housing investment
programmes for local authorities. This will be a first step in increasing
resources for council housing repairs and improvements and for new public
sector house building. We will also give a new priority to getting empty
council owned housing back into use. We will overhaul and extend the
renovation grant and area improvement programme to tackle properly the
decay of our older houses. New and better housing and environmental
standards will be developed and greater provision will be made for hitherto
neglected groups, such as single people.

Council housing

The Tories have forced council rents to more than double. The number of
council homes for rent is falling because of the rundown of new building and
enforced sales. Thousands have to cope with leaking roofs and damp,
inadequate heating, broken down lifts, noise, lack of security, increasing
disrepair and neglect.

Labour will give council tenants a new deal. In addition to a freeze on rents
for a full year, and the restoration of subsidies, Labour will:

¢ fund a national action programme to repair and improve or replace
run-down estates, especially the system-built developments in which
so many defects have been revealed.

¢ Strengthen tenants' rights on security, repairs and improvements,
access to files, exchanges, transfers, moves between local authority
areas, and rehousing rights on breakdown of relationship;

e Encourage more responsive and decentralised housing management
and maintenance, and promote tenant participation and democracy,
including housing co-operatives;

e End all residential and other qualifications, which unfairly exclude
people from council housing in the area where they live, extend the
‘priority’ groups under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act and
strengthen the rights of homeless people;

e End enforced council house sales, empower public landlords to
repurchase homes sold under the Tories on first resale and provide that
future voluntary agreed sales will be at market value.

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

Home ownership

Labour believes in real home ownership at prices people can afford. Under
the Tories the mortgage rate reached its highest ever level at 15 per cent and
is still at 10 per cent. They have done little to help low income groups
become owners.

We support financial assistance for owner-occupation and will maintain
mortgage tax relief for existing house purchasers at the current rate. The
unfairness of mortgage tax relief above the basic rate, which gives most
benefit to the highest incomes, will be phased out. We will also examine the
possibility of a new and substantial form of financial help for first time
buyers, with special consideration for council and new town tenants, aimed
at easing the heavy initial burdens of house purchase.

Labour will act to help home-owners. We will:

¢ Simplify and reduce the cost of house purchase, ending the solicitors’
conveyancing monopoly, and require full disclosure of mortgage
lending terms and practices;

e Make it easier for lower income groups to borrow funds on secure
terms by greatly expanding council mortgage lending and providing
the funds needed. This will be financed primarily by on-lending from
the building societies, at least 10 per cent of whose funds should be
made available in this way;

¢ Allow and encourage councils to provide a unified house-purchase
service, including estate agency, surveying, conveyancing and
mortgage lending;

¢ End the leasehold system for houses, strengthen the rights of
leaseholders of flats and increase protection to mobile home residents.

Privately rented housing

The worst housing conditions are in privately rented housing. The Tories
have loosened the controls on rents and security of tenure and pushed up
rents. If they get the chance, they would abolish all controls.

Labour will ensure that tenants are fully protected. We will:

¢ Actively encourage the transfer of all property owned by absentee
private landlords to the public or owner-occupied sectors, with local
authorities setting the pace. This will not apply to owner-occupiers
letting all or part of their home.

¢ Repeal the Tories' shorthold scheme and close other loopholes in
security of tenure; and strengthen tenants' rights on deposits and
harassment.

¢ Strengthen councils' powers to enforce repairs and improvements and
the standards of management, particularly in multi-occupied
properties; and launch a programme of action against property held
empty without justification.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 30 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

¢ Bring forward measures to strengthen tied tenants' rights and improve
their access to secure housing when they leave their job.

¢ Bring service charges for private tenants and leaseholders within the
fair rents scheme.

Help for all tenants

Tenants in both the public and private sectors are plagued with difficulties
caused by all-too frequent failure of landlords to carry out repairs
satisfactorily and speedily. Tenants recognise that major structural repairs,
for example to blocks of flats or maisonettes, can only be dealt with by
large-scale improvement projects. But they rightly see no reason why routine
repairs should be neglected. Labour will launch a new initiative aimed at
tackling this troublesome problem.

We will introduce a right to repair for all tenants - council, new town,
housing associations and private landlord. This will give tenants the right to
force landlords, including councils, to get routine repairs done, with
landlords footing the cost. Where there are council direct labour
organisations, these will be responsible for doing this work. Major structural
work will not be included, but the Labour government will assist councils to
carry out such work through much larger capital investment allocations and
reinstatement of an adequate housing subsidy system.

We also intend to reform the system of housing benefits for low income
groups. A new Housing Tribunal will be established to replace the present
confusing jumble of courts, tribunals and committees, as an accessible
means of resolving landlord-tenant disputes.

Construction

The Tory recession has seriously damaged the construction industry.
Company after company has gone bankrupt. Nearly 400,000 construction
workers are on the dole. Labour's plan for expansion will help the industry
back to its feet. But we will also introduce changes to the industry, as
described in Labour's Programme, 1982 - not least to help stabilise the
industry's workload. We will also provide greater job security for employees;
and we will work out, with the agreement of the trade unions, a system of
decasualisation.

We also believe that a major new role should be played in the industry by
public and co-operative enterprise - to provide a new source of enterprise,
initiative and innovation. We will establish a new, publicly-owned company,
as a major pace-making public enterprise, for large and medium-sized
construction projects. In addition, to help protect the public interest, we will
extend public ownership into the building materials industry, in which a
small number of large companies now enjoy near monopoly conditions.

We will also give generous and active support to the development of
workers' co operatives, especially at the jobbing' end of the industry. We will

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 31 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

reverse Tory policies towards local authority direct labour organisations. We
will give them more scope by allowing them to compete for other work in
their locality, while ensuring that they are efficiently run as municipal
enterprises. We will oppose the contracting out of government services to
privately-owned companies.

Planning for people

The way we plan the use of our land affects every one of us. It determines
where we build our housing, the kind of shopping centres which are
available, and where new jobs and factories are sited. We are determined to
strengthen local planning and ensure greater participation by ordinary people
over the decisions which affect their lives.

The Tories have always put the interests of property developers before the
needs of local people. Labour will change this. We will ensure that local
authorities are able to decide on the positive use of land in their areas instead
of having to respond to the initiatives of developers. And we shall take
explicit powers to link land-use planning firmly with the economic and
social planning of local authorities.

A key issue in planning at local level is the ownership and use of land. We
are determined to stop land speculation and make sensible and
comprehensive planning possible. We will establish new land authorities,
similar to the successful Land Authority of Wales, with the powers and
funds needed to acquire development land - at its current use value - so that
local plans can be fulfilled. Our proposals do not apply to owner-occupiers,
whose homes and gardens will be safeguarded.

We intend also to widen democratic participation in the planning system by:

¢ Codifying and extending public rights of consultation, and of appeal
against planning decisions;

¢ Improving access to public planning inquiries and broadening their
terms of reference;

e Ensuring that, before the inquiry stage of certain major development
proposals, the environmental effects are subject to detailed analysis
and the report is published;

¢ Creating a new fund to help objectors at major public inquiries, with
an independent board to decide who should be helped and by how
much.

The inner cities

The decay, squalor and level of unemployment in our inner cities are a
national disgrace. Labour is determined to reverse their decline. We will
provide more resources, more investment and more jobs. We will act to
ensure, through the policies set out in this campaign document, that people
living in the inner cities have access to decent homes, health and education -
and that there is proper accountability for the police.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 32 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

In addition to providing a major increase of funds for the Urban Programme,
we will:

e Use agreed development plans, negotiated at national level with major
firms - public and private - to locate investment and jobs in the inner
cities.

¢ Use regional development agencies to prepare sites, encourage
municipal and co-operative enterprise, and help improve transport and
other facilities.

¢ Get local authorities to prepare local economic and social plans. We
will also support the development of well-financed local enterprise
boards in areas which need them - and enable local authorities to
conclude agreed development plans with small and medium-sized
local firms.

The environment

Labour believes that the countryside should be preserved and enhanced as a
source of recreation for town and country dwellers alike and as a habitat for
wild creatures and plants. Everyone has a right to a decent living and
working environment.

We intend to monitor closely - and publicly - the nation's progress in
improving the environment. We shall therefore present to parliament each
year a major report on the 'State of the Environment’. We will also safeguard
our heritage by:

¢ Supporting rights of access to common land. We will stop landed
interests from preventing access for anglers;

¢ Strengthening the planning laws to ensure that the countryside is
protected from damaging development;

¢ Strengthening the legislation which protects endangered species;

¢ Providing increased resources so that the Nature Conservancy Council
and Countryside Commission can function effectively;

e Enacting anew Wildlife and Countryside Act and providing proper
protection for sites of special scientific interests.

We will also act to curb pollution. We will:

¢ Proceed with the implementation of the 1974 Control of Pollution Act.

¢ Undertake a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the present
machinery and powers on pollution control.

¢ Eliminate lead in petrol by setting a date after which all new cars will
be required to use only lead-free petrol. The interests of motorists will
be safeguarded.

¢ Restore those environmental agencies abolished by the Tories with a
responsibility for monitoring air and noise pollution.

e Develop a programme for eliminating toxic substances from our living
and working environments.

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

We will reform the water industry by repealing the Tories' Water Act and
restoring democratic accountability in the industry. We will re-establish a
national authority charged with responsibility for the strategic planning and
use of all water resources. The canal system will be brought under a new
national authority, so that it can be developed and maintained as an essential
water resource. We will also consider how best to provide help, for those on
low incomes, with paying their water rates.

Rural areas

Tory policies have seriously harmed the rural areas. Bus services have
disappeared. Rail links are under threat. Jobs have been axed. Houses are not
being built. Village halls and sub-post offices have been closed. Labour will
act to improve the quality of life in the rural areas; and we have outlined our
plans in Labour's Programme 1982 and in our statement Out of Town, Out of
Mind. We will give greater priority to rural problems. And ministers will be
expected to bring about greater co-ordination in promoting our policies. We
will:

¢ Ensure that the Development Commission, and its counterparts in
Scotland and Wales, become actively involved in implementing our
policies for rural regeneration.

¢ Take measures to increase employment by encouraging the expansion
of light industry and tourism in the rural areas, while safeguarding the
tural nature of the countryside.

¢ Improve the rural public transport network by a major injection of
public funds and a better use of existing resources.

e Wherever possible retain village schools and generally improve
educational provision for all age groups; and introduce mobile health
clinics and mobile ‘all purpose' community services offices.

e Take extensive measures to expand the provision of all types of
housing in the rural areas, which will also help to deal with the
‘Second Home' problem.

Transport

Four years of Tory government has meant serious damage to Britain's
transport system. Profitable elements have been sold off. Important but
unprofitable sections left in public hands are being starved of investment.
The quality of public transport services has fallen disastrously.

Another Tory government would mean even poorer services, higher fares
and lower safety standards. Labour repudiates this whole approach. We
believe that the improvement of public transport must be a major social
priority, which can only be achieved by a sensibly integrated transport
system. We describe our proposals in Labour's Programme 1982.

We will maintain and improve the rail network, invest in the electrification
of the main lines and replace worn-out railway stock. We will encourage the

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 34 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

use of the railways for freight traffic by extending grants for rail freight
facilities and encouraging the development of trans-shipment depots.

Heavy lorries will be made to bear their full share of road costs, including
environment costs. We will cut to a minimum noise and pollution from
goods vehicles and introduce national routeings and restrictions to take
lorries away from people. Vehicle Excise Duty for private cars will be
abolished and the revenue secured by a higher tax on petrol.

Labour believes that, together with a properly enforced licensing system, a
publicly-owned share of the road haulage industry is essential. It would
clearly be sensible for the National Freight Company to form part of this
sector; and we are examining how best to bring this about.

We will ensure that local authorities are able to give proper support to public
transport. In areas where more favourable concessionary travel on local
transport does not exist, we shall bring in a nationwide, off-peak half-fares
scheme for pensioners. A proper licensing system, to safeguard the network
of bus services, will be reintroduced. We shall also ensure that a basic
minimum level of service is provided throughout the country.

In addition, we will:

¢ Encourage the development of effective traffic management schemes
to alleviate the problems of traffic congestion.

¢ Improve facilities and safety standards for cyclists and increase
financial incentives to local authorities to assist these improvements.

¢ Give a high priority to building by passes.

¢ Establish a national shipping organisation able to acquire and operate
shipping services; and protect our shipping and jobs from unfair
foreign competition.

¢ Invest in inland waterways, and encourage the greater use of them -
and of coastal shipping - in the interests of taking freight off our roads.

¢ Establish a new National Ports Authority to take ports into public
ownership and to develop a new overall strategy for these.

¢ Create a National Transport Authority to develop transport policy and
good practice, secure integration and facilitate comprehensive
planning.

Law, order and justice

Labour's aim is to ensure that all sections of the community are safe on the
street and at home, free from the fear that crime generates. We believe that
the police should have the support of the community, have their rights
safeguarded, and be fairly paid. But we also believe that it is as much in the
interests of the police, as of their local communities, that they are properly
accountable and fully subject to the law. We will ensure that, throughout the
country, the police are encouraged to return to the beat and therefore closer
to the communities they serve. That is the best way of preventing and
detecting crime.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 35 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

We intend to protect the rights of individual suspects, while providing the
police with sufficient powers to do their job effectively whilst not infringing
the civil rights of individual suspects. We aim to create elected police
authorities in all parts of the country, including London, with statutory
responsibility for the determination of police policy within their areas. We
will also:

e Launch a major initiative to help victims, including extending and
simplifying the present Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme.

¢ Give priority to crime prevention as part of our action programme for
run down estates.

¢ Bring about better co-ordination in the technical, support and
information services of the police.

¢ Replace the present police complaints procedure with an independent
system accountable to local communities, with minority police
representation.

¢ Create community police councils to provide an opportunity for open
discussion between police and the community as to the quality and
manner of police provision.

¢ Introduce strict limits on searches of people in the street, searches of
premises, the use of the power of arrest, and on the time a prisoner can
be held in custody before being charged.

¢ Protect the rights of those in police custody, by giving revised Judges
Rules, which safeguard those under arrest or interrogation, the force of
law and, in England and Wales, take the role of prosecutor away from
the police by implementing a public prosecutor system, on the
Procurator Fiscal model.

¢ Repeal the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill, because it infringes the
rights and freedoms of individuals.

e Disband the London Special Patrol Groups and local SPGs, which
have increasingly been deployed in aggressive public order roles.

Access to legal services

We will not allow people's legal rights to go by default. Accessible level
services are essential to protect human rights. As described in Labour's
Programme 1982, we will increase central government spending to set up
new law centres and help existing ones, and to improve the legal aid scheme
by widening its provisions. We will also introduce a system of appeals
against the refusal of legal aid in criminal cases.

We will speed the extension of duty solicitor schemes to all magistrate courts
and police stations in England and Wales. We will also introduce measures
to help citizens to secure their legal rights in the areas of tribunal and
welfare rights law.

We will co-ordinate the responsibility for advice and legal services so that
ministerial responsibility is clearer and more direct. We will also establish a
new Legal Services Commission to be responsible for the provision and
financing of public legal services. Our aim is to ensure that the expertise and

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 36 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

training of the legal profession should be geared far more than at present to
those legal problems affecting ordinary people.

The penal system

No one concerned for human dignity and civil rights can find our prison
system acceptable. We are determined to improve conditions. We do not
accept that wives and children should be punished together with the
prisoners. We will:

¢ Reduce the prison population by cutting many maximum sentence
lengths for non-violent offenders. We will stop putting petty offenders
into prison. We will expand non-custodial alternatives, and examine
new penalties involving reparation and restitution to the victim. We
will also introduce a maximum period of custody for those on remand,
along the lines of the provisions in Scotland.

e Treat prisoners as human beings by providing reasonable conditions in
our prisons. We will incorporate, in new, legally enforceable prison
rules, minimum standards on such matters as cell space. And we will
reduce unnecessary restrictions - for example on prisoners'
correspondence.

¢ Refurbish urban prisons.

¢ Hand over all specialist services in prisons, such as medical care, to
the normal community agencies.

e Establish a genuinely independent complaints and disciplinary
procedure to replace the current board of visitors system; and provide
better aftercare for those leaving prison, to help them resettle in the
community.

¢ Improve the training, working conditions and job opportunities of
prison officers.

e Examine the additional problems faced by women prisoners,
especially those with young children.

Equal rights

The next Labour government will lead a political offensive against racial
disadvantage, discrimination and harassment; and we have set out our
proposals in Labour's Programme 1982. To encourage equality and reduce
discrimination, we will greatly expand funding to ethnic minority projects.
We will also encourage local authorities, in selecting projects under the
Urban Programme, to provide for greater ethnic minority participation. We
will also:

¢ Stimulate a wide range of positive action programmes to ensure that
ethnic minorities receive a fair deal - in employment, education,
housing and social services: and encourage the keeping of ethnic
records, in order to assess the needs of ethnic minorities and take steps
to meet them.

e Launch a major public education initiative aimed at eliminating
prejudice.

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

¢ Strengthen the existing Race Relations Act - in particular, to enable us
to deal more effectively with racialist literature, speeches and
marches; and to remove the exception for seamen recruited abroad.

¢ Appoint a senior minister to lead the offensive against racial
inequality.

We are concerned that homosexuals are unfairly treated. We will take steps
to ensure that they are not unfairly discriminated against - especially in
employment and in the definition of privacy contained in the 1967 Act -
along the lines set out in Labour's Programme, 1982.

Nationality and immigration

Through their immigration and nationality laws, the Tories have divided
families and caused immense suffering in the immigrant communities. We
accept the need for immigration controls. But we will repeal the 1971
Immigration Act and the 1981 British Nationality Act and replace them with
a citizenship law that does not discriminate against either women or black
and Asian Britons.

Under our Nationality Act, we will restore rights removed by the Tories,
such as the right to automatic citizenship if born in Britain. The Act will
enable other Commonwealth and foreign nationals to acquire citizenship if
they qualify by objective tests, and provide a right of appeal against the
refusal of an application for citizenship. We will also ensure that the cost of
acquiring citizenship will no longer be an obstacle to those who wish to

apply.

Under our new Immigration Act we will liberalise the age limit criteria for
children and the criteria for elderly parents and other relatives. We will
simplify the procedures and commit the resources necessary for all
applications to be processed promptly; and allow medical examinations,
including x-rays, only for medical, not administrative purposes. The race and
sex discrimination in the husbands and fiances' rules will be ended: we will
restore the entitlement to admission to join a woman settled here irrespective
of her citizenship, birthplace or ancestry. We will also ensure that
immigration officials fully respect the human rights of those seeking entry.
We will also:

¢ Consult Commonwealth governments so as to resolve the question of
the other British nationals from independent countries who possess no
other citizenship.

¢ Provide a right of appeal for those who the Home Secretary proposes
to deport or exclude on security grounds.

¢ Establish a more independent and balanced panel of adjudicators for
immigration appeals.

A wider democracy

Labour will take action to enhance democratic rights and ensure greater

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 38 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

openness and accountability in the institutions of government. We have set
out our policies in Labour's Programme, 1982. We shall:

e Introduce a Freedom of Information Bill, providing for a genuine
system of open government and placing the onus on the authorities to
justify withholding information.

¢ Bring in data protection legislation to prevent the abuse of confidential
information held on personal files; and, subject to certain exceptions,
allow individuals access to their personal records.

¢ Reform the administration of government and the civil service
machine so that it meets modern needs and is properly accountable to
elected representatives. We recognise the damage done to the morale
and efficiency of the civil service by this government. We will work to
repair this damage, together with the unions, and to give proper
recognition to the importance of the work of the service.

¢ Take action to abolish the undemocratic House of Lords as quickly as
possible and, as an interim measure, introduce a Bill in the first
session of parliament to remove its legislative powers - with the
exception of those which relate to the life of a parliament.

¢ Make improvements in the legislative process and procedures in the
House of Commons.

¢ Reform the procedures for appointments to public bodies to ensure
they are more open and genuinely representative of the community.

¢ Overhaul the outdated honours system.

e Give a new priority to making our public services more responsive to
the needs and wishes of those who use them. Wherever possible we
will decentralise services to make them as close as possible to those
who use them. We will also provide more effective procedures for
complaints - with clear rights for users - and ensure better training and
status for those in contact with the public.

Labour believes that state aid for political parties is now essential for the
working of our parliamentary democracy. We will introduce such aid, along
the lines set out in the Houghton Report, with the funds available adjusted to
today's prices and index linked.

The security services

There is now widespread concern about our security services. We intend that
they should become properly accountable institutions - and that the civil
rights of individuals are fully protected. We outline in Labour's Programme,
1982 our proposals for a new Security Act, to define the powers and
responsibilities of the services, including those concerned with the
interception of communications. We will also extend parliamentary
accountability - including over the accounts of the services - which will be
assisted by a new select committee; prohibit, under the Security Act,
unauthorised surveillance; and abolish 'D' notices.

Local democracy

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 39 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

Labour is determined to strengthen local democracy. We will shift radically
the balance between central and local government and give local
communities much more say about how their services are run.

First, we will give local authorities freedom to implement comprehensive
local plans, covering economic, social and environmental policies. We
explain elsewhere in this document, and more fully in Labour's Programme,
1982, our proposals to assist local authorities to create jobs, to establish local
enterprise boards and engage in local economic planning. We will reverse
Tory policies on the privatisation of local authority services.

Second, we will expand the scope for local democracy. Instead of local
councillors never being completely sure what is permitted and what is ultra
vires, we shall give a power of general competence to all local authorities to
carry out whatever activities are not expressly forbidden by statute. We shall
also seek to define the relationship between central and local government -
as part of our consideration of the universal application of realistic minimum
standards - so that basic provision of key services is available in all parts of
the country. We will also:

Take action to encourage councils to make their services more responsive to
the needs and wishes of their clients and of the local community.

Extend workers' rights and industrial democracy in local government, by
enabling non-voting employee representatives to be co-opted on to
committees, and encouraging the introduction of formal procedures for
participation in decisions on the implementation of policy. We will also
allow all but the most senior officers the right to become elected or co-opted
members of the authority which employs them.

Pay proper allowances, and provide adequate administrative support, to local
councillors.

We are examining how best to reform local government. We believe that
services such as health, water and sewerage should become answerable to a
much greater extent to elected members; and we aim to end, if we can, the
present confusing division of services between two tiers of authority. Unitary
district authorities, in England and Wales, could be responsible for all of the
functions in this area that they could sensibly undertake. We will also ensure
that the City of London is absorbed into a reformed democratic system of
local government. For Scotland, any reform of local government will be a
matter for our proposed Scottish Assembly.

Local government finance

Labour will reverse the Tory government's attacks on local authority
services. We shall provide finance, through the rate support grant, to allow
local authority expenditure to grow in line with our plans for economic
expansion; and the hard-pressed urban areas will benefit especially from an
increased share of the resources available.

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

Labour believes in active local democracy. We will therefore repeal the Tory
legislation which allows the government to impose ceilings on local
authority spending, and to impose penalties on local authorities whose
spending exceeds those ceilings. We shall repeal the ban on supplementary
rates. We will restore the right of local authorities to spend additional
amounts from revenue on capital expenditure in excess of loan sanction
limits. The rate support grant system will be recast to give fairer treatment to
areas in greatest need and the maximum freedom of action for local
authorities to control their own budgets.

Labour will also enact legislation to abolish the penalty of personal
surcharge on individual councillors. Instead councillors, like others in the
community, will be liable at law for any unlawful or illegal acts. Public audit
will be confined to that purpose and auditors will not be permitted to involve
themselves in judgements on politics or policies.

Devolution to Scotland

Labour is determined to decentralise power in decision-making. In Scotland,
the people have shown their support for devolution in a referendum and at
successive general elections; and we have set out our proposals for
devolution in a major statement, Scotland and Devolution. Labour will:

¢ Establish a directly elected Scottish Assembly, with an executive
drawn from members of the assembly.

¢ Provide the Assembly with legislative and executive powers over a
wide range of domestic policy, including matters such as health,
education and social welfare.

e Ensure a major role for the Assembly in assisting in the regeneration
of Scottish industry - including the preparation and implementation of
a Plan for Scotland - within the context of our overall national plan.

¢ As well as receiving grants from central government, the Scottish
Assembly will have tax-raising powers, thus ensuring that the level of
services provided can be determined in Scotland.

Northern Ireland

Labour believes that Ireland should, by peaceful means and on the basis of
consent, be united, and recognises that this will be achieved with the
introduction of socialist policies. We respect and support, however, the right
of the Northern Ireland people to remain within the UK, although this does
not mean that Unionist leaders can have a veto on political development;
and we accept that, to achieve agreement and consent between the two parts
of Ireland, we must create greater unity within the Northern Ireland
community.

In our 1981 conference statement and in Labour's Programme 1982, we set

out in full Labour's policy on Northern Ireland. We will aim to establish an
agreed, devolved administration. In the meantime, we will continue with

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 41 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

direct rule. We will also initiate early discussions between the British
government, the Irish government, the Irish Labour Party, and the trade
unions on both sides of the border, and political representatives of the people
of Northern Ireland, on how best to proceed with our policy of unification by
consent.

Tory policies have been a disaster for the Northern Ireland economy.
Unemployment has soared. The economy is in ruins. Housing and the social
services are in desperate straits. Labour will give new hope to Northern
Ireland. We will create jobs and provide investment. We will use all of the
economic planning powers and institutions set out in this document -
together with a massive injection of public resources - to rebuild the
economy.

We will also act on security and civil rights, along the lines set out in our
1981 statement. We will repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the
Payment of Debt Act and reform the system of Diplock courts. We will
provide equal rights for women, including rights to abortion, and make
progress towards an integrated comprehensive system of education.

Leisure for living

Labour believes that a comprehensive approach is needed, at national and
local levels, to provide services and facilities for leisure.

The arts

A crucial part will be played in this by the arts. Labour's aim is to make the
arts, in their broadest sense, an accepted part of everyday life for the whole
population. We will place special emphasis on their availability to the young,
the handicapped and the retired. Substantial extra funds will be provided,
with priority being given to the regions and to access for those on low
incomes. Local authorities will have a statutory duty to provide adequate arts
and entertainments facilities; and the arts will be zero-rated in respect of
VAT.

We will retain a Minister of the Arts, whose first task will be to undertake a
major survey on the disparities in provision between regions and to produce
proposals for action. The public bodies which support the arts will also be
made more open and accountable, and include more representation from
workers in the arts, local authorities and consumers. The Craft Council will
be strengthened, and regional museums and galleries supported through a
Museums and Galleries Council.

For the film industry, we will establish a British Film Authority, responsible
for the National Film Finance Corporation. This will ensure that revenue
from a levy on ticket sales goes to British film-makers who produce British
films. We will also ensure that the profits from British film-making and
distribution are channelled back into British films - and that the present two-
company monopoly of film distribution in Britain is ended. The new British

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 42 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

Film Authority will be responsible for extending public ownership into film
distribution.

Sport and recreation

Labour will accept responsibility for the provision of a broadly-based leisure
service. We will:

¢ Encourage greater participation in sport and recreation.
¢ Give incentives to voluntary bodies to involve themselves more
widely in the provision of sporting and community facilities.
¢ Encourage local authorities and other owners of facilities to make
them much more available to public use.
¢ Set up an immediate enquiry into the financial basis of sport and
recreation.
© Review the provision of national sporting facilities, so as to
secure a fairer geographical distribution.
o Ensure that the sporting talent of the nation receives sufficient
support to enable them to bring sporting success to Britain.

We will also provide for the wider use of the countryside for recreational
purposes, such as angling and other water-based sports. Angling will be
given additional support, by ensuring wider access to rivers and lakes,
financial assistance to provide a wider ownership of fishing waters,
improvements in respect of conservation, and action to prevent pollution.

The media

Our aims in the media are to safeguard freedom of expression, encourage
diversity and establish greater accountability. For all the media, we will
introduce a statutory right of reply to ensure that individuals can set the
record straight. We will introduce stronger measures to prevent any further
concentration in the media.

For the press, we will encourage diversity by:

¢ Setting up a launch fund to assist new publications.

e Ensuring that all major wholesalers accept any lawful publication, and
arrange for its proper supply and display, subject to a handling charge.

¢ Preventing acquisition of further newspapers by large press chains.

¢ Protecting freedom of expression by prohibiting joint control of the
press, commercial radio and television.

¢ Breaking up major concentrations of press ownership, by setting an
upper limit for the number of major publications in the hands of a
single proprietor or press group.

¢ Replacing the Press Council with a stronger, more representative body.

In broadcasting, we Will aim to make both broadcasting itself, and the

organisations responsible, more accountable and representative - and to
provide greater public access. Our aim is to promote a more wide-ranging

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 43 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

and genuine pluralism in the media, and we set out our prop6sals in Labour's
Programme 1982. We will also seek to introduce a genuinely independent
adjudication of grievances and complaints. The licence fee will be phased
out for pensioners, during the lifetime of the Labour government.

The high standards of British public service broadcasting are threatened by
Tory plans to introduce cable TV on free-market principles. We will regulate
satellite and cable provision and foster the same principles of diversity and
pluralism as conventional broadcasting authorities. To avoid wasteful
duplication, we will entrust the provision of the national cable system to
British Telecom.

Animal protection

The Labour Party was the first major political party to publish a policy
statement, in 1978, on animal protection - Living Without Cruelty; and these
policies are reaffirmed in Labour's Programme 1982. We believe that all
animals - whether in the wild, domesticated or farmed - should be properly
treated.

To achieve our aims we will transform the Farm Animal Welfare Council
into a Standing Royal Commission on Animal Protection. We will also
urgently review the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act. A high priority will be
given to research into alternatives to using live animals in experiments, and
to restrictions on the use of live animals in experiments - with proper control
and supervision in order to avoid pain.

Hare coursing, fox hunting and all forms of hunting with dogs will be made
illegal. This will not, however, affect shooting and fishing. The use of snares
will also be made illegal.

We will lay down clear conditions on freedom of movement for livestock;
and we will ensure that our legislation meets, at least, the requirements of
the European Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming
Purposes. We will also ban, over a phased period, all extreme livestock
systems and introduce legislation to ensure that animals are slaughtered as
near as possible to the point of production. We will ban the export of live
food animals.

Animals kept in zoos, circuses and safari parks will be included in our
animals protection legislation. Health and safety at work legislation will be
reviewed in order to better protect people employed on such premises.

Britain and the Common Market

Geography and history determine that Britain is part of Europe, and Labour
wants to see Europe safe and prosperous. But the European Economic
Community, which does not even include the whole of Western Europe, was
never devised to suit us, and our experience as a member of it has made it
more difficult for us to deal with our economic and industrial problems. It

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 44 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

has sometimes weakened our ability to achieve the objectives of Labour's
international policy.

The next Labour government, committed to radical, socialist policies for
reviving the British economy, is bound to find continued membership a most
serious obstacle to the fulfilment of those policies. In particular the rules of
the Treaty of Rome are bound to conflict with our strategy for economic
growth and full employment, our proposals on industrial policy and for
increasing trade, and our need to restore exchange controls and to regulate
direct overseas investment. Moreover, by preventing us from buying food
from the best sources of world supply, they would run counter to our plans to
control prices and inflation.

For all these reasons, British withdrawal from the Community is the right
policy for Britain - to be completed well within the lifetime of the
parliament. That is our commitment. But we are also committed to bring
about withdrawal in an amicable and orderly way, so that we do not
prejudice employment or the prospect of increased political and economic
co-operation with the whole of Europe.

We emphasise that our decision to bring about withdrawal in no sense
represents any weakening of our commitment to internationalism and
international co operation. We are not ‘withdrawing from Europe'. We are
seeking to extricate ourselves from the Treaty of Rome and other
Community treaties which place political burdens on Britain. Indeed, we
believe our withdrawal will allow us to pursue a more dynamic and positive
international policy - one which recognises the true political and
geographical spread of international problems and interests. We will also
seek agreement with other European governments - both in the EEC and
outside - on a common strategy for economic expansion.

The process of withdrawal

On taking office we will open preliminary negotiations with the other EEC
member states to establish a timetable for withdrawal; and we will publish
the results of these negotiations in a White Paper. In addition, as soon as
possible after the House assembles, we will introduce a Repeal Bill: first, in
order to amend the 1972 European Communities Act, ending the powers of
the Community in the UK; and second, to provide the necessary powers to
repeal the 1972 Act, when the negotiations on withdrawal are completed.

Following the publication of the White Paper, we will begin the main
negotiations on withdrawal. Later, when appropriate and in the same
parliament, we will use our powers to repeal the 1972 Act and abrogate the
Treaty of Accession - thus breaking all of our formal links with the
Community. Britain will at this point withdraw from the Council of
Ministers and from the European Parliament.

There will need to be a period of transition, to ensure a minimum of
disruption - and to phase in any new agreements we might make with the

Community. This will enable us to make all the necessary changes in our

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 45 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

domestic legislation. Until these changes in UK law have taken place, the
Status quo as regards particular items of EEC legislation will remain. And
this period will, of course, extend beyond the date when we cease, formally,
to be members.

The international dimension

The Labour Party is working to create a democratic socialist society in
Britain, but we realise to achieve this we must enjoy the fullest international
co-operation. There is a real interdependence between nations, and, if Britain
under Labour is not to stand on the sidelines, we must co-operate to survive.
Our foreign policy is a logical extension of our work at home.

A deep crisis now afflicts the world economy. In the developed world,
recession has meant lengthening dole queues and a falling standard of life;
for the peoples of the Third World, recession has added to an already
intolerable burden of poverty. Unlike the Tories, Labour believes that there
is a way out of the crisis, and that we need not accept an international status
quo so manifestly riddled with injustice, inefficiency and waste. Labour will
pursue and win international support for policies designed to stimulate trade,
investment, and growth; and we shall work inside the appropriate institutions
to end the financial chaos which now threatens the stability of so many
countries. There can be no sure prospect of peace in a world wracked by an
enduring economic crisis. Labour's policies will help bring that crisis to an
end.

Labour recognises the urgent need to restore détente and dialogue between
the states and the peoples of the world. We will actively pursue dialogue
with the Soviet Union and China, and will urge the American government to
do so. We will work consistently for peace and disarmament, and devote all
our efforts to pulling the world back from the nuclear abyss. Labour will
dedicate some of the resources currently wasted on armaments to projects
designed to promote both security and human development.

An essential difference between the Labour and the Tory approach is that we
have a foreign policy that will help liberate the peoples of the world from
oppression, want and fear. We seek to find ways in which social and political
progress can be achieved and to identify the role that Britain can play in this
process.

Our objectives cannot be pursued in isolation; we will work with the
international agencies, friendly governments, and with socialist parties and
genuine liberation movements in order to convert these objectives into
concrete achievements.

Disarmament - the international context
The pursuit of peace, development and disarmament is central to our policy.

We wish to strengthen the process of détente, which means the easing of
political as well as military tension between East and West. A third world

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 46 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

war would destroy civilisation, yet the danger of a nuclear holocaust grows
alarmingly.

Labour is determined that Britain should play its full part in the struggle for
peace. Now in 1983, in what is a critical year for peace, we can begin to
influence events by the way we present the imperative case for disarmament.
In government we can carry that influence much further, by example and by
common action with others. We must use unilateral steps taken by Britain to
secure multilateral solutions on the international level. Unilateralism and
multilateralism must go hand ill hand if either is to succeed. It is for this
reason that we are against moves that would disrupt our existing alliances,
but are resolved on measures to enable Britain to pursue a non-nuclear
defence policy.

To achieve our paramount aim - stopping the nuclear arms race itself, and
the other arms races pursued beneath its shadow - we need stronger
international institutions. First and foremost is a United Nations organisation
with real and growing authority. Labour is determined to sustain and fortify
the United Nations. All our recent experience re-emphasises how necessary
it is to have an international Charter against aggression. It is a tragedy that
the 1982 UN Special Session on Disarmament was allowed to disband in
failure and disappointment. We shall work to recall a new session on a more
ambitious and hopeful basis. We will support the commitments of the UN
Special Sessions on Disarmament and the UN Committee on Disarmament.

We shall seek to restore the Final Document on Disarmament, approved by
the 1978 United Nations Special Session, as the long-term objective. But, of
course, as the international tension sharpens, we must pursue other more
immediate aims. Labour has always opposed Soviet deployment of SS20s.
We want to see the Geneva talks on intermediate weapons succeed. Labour
was arguing that they should begin long before President Reagan and Mrs.
Thatcher came round to the idea. It is imperative that the SALT II agreement
is ratified. We shall work for this. We strongly support the reduction of
strategic weapons in the START talks. We will propose urgent action to
make the Non-Proliferation Treaty effective and to keep it effective. The
uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons would enormously increase
the danger to us all.

Following the steps taken by the last Labour government in such fields as
non proliferation and the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks,
Britain must again take a lead in disarmament negotiations.

Defence policy

The overriding task for Britain, as for the rest of the world, is to draw back
from the nuclear abyss. Britain must act on her own account as well as
seeking agreement with other countries on nuclear disarmament.

One immediate step our government must take is to insist on implementing
the recent United Nations call for a freeze on the production, deployment

and testing of nuclear weapons, and for a comprehensive test ban. That the

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 47 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

Tory government should have voted against these propositions in the United
Nations is deplorable, and betrays our country's capacity to play a leading
role as an advocate of world disarmament. Labour's proposals will help to
restore that opportunity.

Labour believes in effective defence through collective security but rejects
the present emphasis on nuclear weapons. Britain and her allies should have
sufficient military strength to discourage external aggression and to defend
themselves should they be attacked. Labour's commitment is to establish a
non-nuclear defence policy for this country. This means the rejection of any
fresh nuclear bases or weapons on British soil or in British waters, and the
removal of all existing nuclear bases and weapons, thus enabling us to make
a direct contribution to an eventually much wider nuclear-free zone in
Europe. However, all this cannot be done at once, and the way we do it must
be designed to assist in the task to which we are also committed - securing
nuclear disarmament agreements with other countries and maintaining co
operation with our allies.

The most pressing objective must be to prevent the deployment here or
elsewhere in Western Europe of Cruise or Pershing missiles. This
deployment would mark a new and dangerous escalation in the nuclear arms
race. It would make the achievement of effective disarmament agreements
covering these and other weapons much more difficult in the future. We will
therefore not permit the siting of Cruise missiles in this country and will
remove any that are already in place.

The next Labour government will cancel the Trident programme. Apart from
the huge, persisting and distorting burden it would impose on our defence
budget and our economy as a whole, it would not offer security but would
rather help to intensify the arms race. We will propose that Britain's Polaris
force be included in the nuclear disarmament negotiations in which Britain
must take part. We will, after consultation, carry through in the lifetime of
the next parliament our non-nuclear defence policy.

Labour believes in collective security. The next Labour government will
maintain its support for NATO, as an instrument of détente no less than of
defence. We wish to see NATO itself develop a non-nuclear strategy. We will
work towards the establishment of a new security system in Europe based on
mutual trust and confidence, and knowledge of the objectives and
capabilities of all sides. The ultimate objective of a satisfactory relationship
in Europe is the mutual and concurrent phasing out of both NATO and the
Warsaw Pact.

We oppose any attempt to expand the role of the alliance into other
continents. We condemn the doctrine that nuclear war can be limited, and the
notion that somehow the West must catch up with a supposed nuclear
superiority in the East. We are opposed to the introduction into Europe of
any new nuclear systems such as the neutron bomb. We oppose, too, the
storage, research and production of chemical and biological weapons, and
call for the withdrawal of all forward stocks of chemical weapons.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 48 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

Labour will reduce the proportion of the nation's resources devoted to
defence so that the burden we bear will be brought into line with that of the
other major European NATO countries, without increasing the reliance on
nuclear weapons. A Labour government will plan to ensure that savings in
military expenditure do not lead to unemployment for those working in
defence industries. We shall give material support and encouragement to
plans for industrial conversion so that the valuable resources of the defence
industries can be used for the production of useful goods.

The emphasis of our defence priorities in the 1980s and 1990s must be to
create military forces that are clearly equipped and deployed for defensive
purposes, and tailored more to Britain's geography and economic resources.
This will mean maintaining adequate conventional forces, at present
threatened by the extravagant expenditure on Trident.

We are alarmed by the growth of the arms trade. Labour will limit Britain's
arms sales abroad and ban the supply of arms to repressive regimes such as
South Africa, El Salvador, Chile, Argentina and Turkey. We will not supply
arms to countries where the chances of international aggression or internal
repression would be increased. Labour will ensure that all arms sales are
under strict ministerial control, subject to parliamentary accountability.

The Commonwealth and the developing world

We shall continue to work for the peaceful and just settlement of disputes
and the strengthening of international organisations, particularly the
Commonwealth, as well as the United Nations. Labour has always attached a
special significance to the Commonwealth - a unique forum of nations,
cutting across ethnic, cultural and ideological barriers. We will strengthen
Britain's political and material commitment to the Commonwealth.

The future prosperity of Britain, as well as that of other industrialised
countries, is inextricably linked to the future of the developing world. At the
moment some 30 per cent of Britain's manufacturing exports are destined for
Third World countries with which we enjoy a very healthy balance of trade.
If their economies could be stimulated, the gain would be ours as well as
theirs. Countless British jobs have already come about as a consequence of
our trading relationship with the poorer countries. That relationship must be
strengthened and expanded in the interests of working people both in Britain
and overseas.

The war that Labour will wage on poverty in Britain will be extended to the
developing world. A primary objective of the next Labour government's
foreign policy will be to help revive the North-South dialogue. That some
800,000,000 people should be condemned to a life of absolute poverty in the
Third World is an affront to any version of civilised values, as well as a
constant threat to international peace and stability.

Labour sets a high priority on attacking the causes of mass poverty. A
Labour government will reach the UN sponsored aid target of 0.7 per cent of
Gross National Product and work towards a further target of 1.0 per cent. We

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 49 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

will also re-establish the principle that aid must be used in the interests of
the poorest people in the poorest countries and, in our efforts to bring this
about, we will fund as appropriate, both governments and independent
organisations. Labour will set up once again a separate Ministry of Overseas
Development with a cabinet minister.

Labour will plan an expansion of trade with the developing world and will
work to bring about changes in the international trading system that will be
of benefit to poor countries, allowing them to receive stable prices for their
commodity exports and to diversify their production. In trade agreements,
Labour will insist upon workers' rights and will bring in legislation to
control the activities of British-based multinational companies operating
overseas.

Labour believes that, in order to enhance the prospects of the Third World
economies, it will be vital to ensure that organisations such as the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund receive adequate funding from
the world community, and provide loans in a way that, taking into account
the economic difficulties faced by each developing country, will improve the
condition of their peoples.

There is much Britain can do to lift people out of absolute poverty, and a
Labour Britain will once again speak out in solidarity with the poor and the
oppressed everywhere.

We will ensure that provision for overseas students is based on a major
expansion of the ODA programme for student sponsorship giving preference
to entrants on grounds of origin, income level and availability of courses in
Britain and elsewhere.

The Law of the Sea

Labour welcomes the recently concluded United Nations Conference on the
Law of the Sea and fully supports the UNCLOS proposal for a new
international regime covering every aspect of ocean use. Unlike either the
Tory government or the Reagan administration, Labour will endorse the Law
of the Sea, which we see as a crucial element in the North-South dialogue,
and will ensure that Britain participates actively in the future progress of
UNCLOS.

Near and Middle East

The Labour Party is committed to the promotion of peace, democracy and
socialism in the Middle East, and to the principle of national self-
determination. The Arab-Israeli conflict remains a major element in the
continuing conflict and tension in the region, through not the only one. The
core of the conflict is the struggle between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples
for the realisation of national self-determination.

We shall therefore:

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 50 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

¢ Support the right of all Israelis to live in peace and security in the state
of Israel, within secure internationally recognised borders.

¢ Support the right of Palestinians to self determination, including the
establishment of a Palestinian state.

The suffering of the Lebanese people and their continued occupation by
foreign forces demands our attention, and we shall work for the restoration
of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Lebanon, and
play a full part in its reconstruction.

The Turkish dictatorship is of special concern to Britain, given Turkish
membership of NATO and its status in Europe. We deplore the constitution
imposed upon the Turkish people and will work for the restoration of
freedom and democracy. Until this is achieved we shall oppose assistance to
the Turkish junta.

Labour is deeply concerned by the continuing violation of human rights
throughout the Middle East. Labour will do what it can to help those
struggling for freedom, democracy, civil and trade union rights.

We support genuine guarantees for the independent, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Cyprus, and the pursuit of intercommunal discussions
sponsored by the UN for as long as both communities are committed to
those talks.

Africa

We are totally opposed to apartheid and will unequivocally support its
opponents, giving financial and material assistance to the liberation
movements in South Africa and SWAPO of Namibia. Labour will also work
with our trade union colleagues to assist the non-racial trade unions in. South
Africa.

We will carry through a systematic programme of economic disengagement
from South Africa by supporting comprehensive mandatory sanctions at the
UN and curtailing our economic relations with the regime. The details of our
policy towards Southern Africa are set out in Labour's Programme 1982.

Latin America

Latin America is a continent in crisis. The world recession and severe
financial difficulties have added to the burden of already frail economies.
Democracy is established in very few countries; torture and death are
instruments of control in many areas.

Central America is of particular concern. Treated for decades by the United
States as its backyard, the countries of this region have almost without
exception failed to establish a tradition of representative democracy.
Millions of people have endured a lifetime of oppression and deprivation. In
recent years, the pressure for social change to respond to basic needs has
grown intense, but has met with the firm resistance of the wealthy and the

http://labourmanifesto.com/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 51 of 53

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

powerful, invariably backed by Washington. This is true of El Salvador,
Nicaragua and Guatemala. Labour rejects US policy in Central America.
Regrettably, the Tory government has connected Britain with that policy by
its slavish support for everything the Reagan administration says and does.
This applies even in the case of Guatemala, which the US is re-arming, when
it lays claim to Belize, to whose defence we are committed.

Labour will do everything in its power to weaken Latin America's repressive
governments by, for example, withdrawing diplomatic representation,
opposing multilateral loans, banning arms sales and drawing international
attention to human rights violations. Our detailed policy is set out in
Labour's Programme 1982.

Falkland Islands

Mrs. Thatcher's policy of Fortress Falklands is imposing an intolerable
burden both on the British people and on the inhabitants of the Falklands
themselves. The war, which wiser policies could have avoided, has already
cost us £1,000 million. On top of that the Conservative government plans to
spend £600 million a year for the indefinite future on garrisoning the islands
- £1 1/2 million per year for every Falklands family.

With four British servicemen on the islands to every adult male Falklander,
the traditional way of life of this rural community is being destroyed. Yet at
the same time Mrs. Thatcher is allowing British firms to equip warships for
the Argentine dictatorship and is lending money to General Bignone to
spend on arms. A Labour government would not sell arms to any Argentine
government which was hostile to Britain or denied civil rights and
democratic freedoms to its own people. Labour believes that Britain must
restore normal links between the Falklands and the Latin American
mainland, and that the United Nations must be involved in finding a
permanent settlement of the problem.

Asia

Emotional as well as political ties exist between Britain and many of the
countries of Asia. It was the 1945 Labour government which gave
independence to India and Pakistan.

Labour is concerned about the suppression of human and civil rights in
many of the countries of Asia, and we will support every extension of
democracy in the region. A Labour government will end military
involvement with those countries that have repressive regimes.

The Labour Party is concerned that the Tory policy on overseas students'
fees has already affected the ability of students from Asia, as well as
elsewhere, to undertake courses in Britain. Steps will be taken to improve
the position, as laid out in a previous section.

Labour believes in a closer understanding with China, and hopes that China

1983 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:26

can become more directly involved in international discussions on peace,
disarmament and the world economy. We will hold talks with China with the
aim of securing a peaceful and prosperous future for the people of Hong
Kong.

Japan is a major power in the world economy. We hope to persuade Japan to
play a more active part in a concerted expansion of the economies of the
industrial nations, and to remove the obstacles that her trade policies now
create. We also hope that Japan will help to bridge the division between
North and South by increasing her aid to the Third World.

Human rights

Labour gives the highest priority to the protection of human dignity, civil
rights, democracy and freedom, which will be reflected in all that a Labour
government does.

We uphold the rights of all nations to self-determination. Accordingly, we
condemn the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and US support for repressive
regimes in Central America. We warn against all military interventions
contrary to the UN Charter. We condemn violations of human rights
wherever they occur, whether in Poland, Turkey or Nigeria, and whatever
the complexion of the government concerned. Labour will further the cause
of human rights in all international organisations. We will press for
suspension from NATO of any dictatorship.

We will protect the opponents of regimes from harassment by their
government's representatives in Britain. Our policy on refugees will be more
compassionate than that of the Tory government. We will not deport
individuals who would face arrest or death in their own countries.

We will also take into account human rights considerations when giving aid.
Official aid will not be given to governments that persistently violate civil

and trade union rights. Help will instead be given to the victims of
repression.

1987 Labour Party Manifesto

 

Britain will win with Labour

Introduction

By the Leader of the Labour Party

Every election is a time of decision. But this General Election on June 11
faces the British people with choices more sharp than at any time in the past
fifty years.

The choices are between Labour's programme of work for people and Tory
policies of waste of people: between investment in industrial strength, and
acceptance of industrial decline; between a Britain with competitive, modern
industries, and a Britain with a low tech, low paid, low security economy
increasingly dependent upon imports.

The election will decide whether we and our children are to live in a country
that builds high standards of care for all who need treatment for illness,
pensions in retirement, good grounding in education, fair chances to get on;
or in a country where the Conservatives go on running down the vital health,
education and social services of every community, imposing higher charges
and lower standards.

This election will decide whether our country is to be a United Kingdom or a
divided kingdom; one that is brought together by proper provision, prudent
investment and concern for the interests of the whole nation, or one that is
pulled apart by poverty, cuts, increased privilege for the richest and neglect
for the rest.

This election will decide whether we put our resources into the real defence
provided by a modern, well-equipped army, navy and airforce safeguarding
our country an d supporting NATO; or spend those sums on maintaining an
ageing system of nuclear weapons, while buying a new generation of
missiles which cannot give our country effective defence. It will decide
whether Britain is part of the international process of nuclear build down or
ruled by a government uniquely intent upon nuclear build-up.

We already know what a third term for Mrs Thatcher would mean for the
people of Britain.

Under the Tories there have been:

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

Eight years of record unemployment, relentless industrial closures and
redundancies, of flooding imports and shrunken investment.

Eight years of the highest ever tax burden on the family and the nation as
VAT, National Insurance, rates and fees have all been put up in a shift to
taxes on spending and employment.

Eight years of cuts and closures and charges, of intensified means tests and
reduced services.

Eight years of increased state control, of centralising government of
abolition of rights of representation and negotiation.

Eight years of rising crime, of greater insecurity on the streets and housing
estates and in the home.

Eight years of meanness towards the needy in our country and towards the
wretched of the world.

Eight years of growing division - in health in opportunity. in housing
conditions in work and in income - between regions communities classes.

families, white and black, rich and poor.

The Tories say they are ‘proud of their record'. So proud indeed that they
would want to do more of the same if they were re-elected.

Their plans for a poll tax would penalise millions of families, pensioners and
young people. Their refusal to provide the resources needed for the Health
Service and their plans for imposing further payment and privatisation will
hit everyone in the service and everyone needing to use it.

They would, if they won power again, privatise water, electricity, steel and
other services, and industries built up by public investment over past years.
They want to impose penal increases in rents for private and public tenants.

They are committed to introducing compulsory labour for young
unemployed people.

All this and worse would come with a third term of Tory government.

Britain cannot afford more of that run-down, sell-off and split-up, nor all the
costs and waste that they bring.

Britain does not have to.
Britain can stop the rot - but only by voting Labour.
There is no other way to prevent thirteen years of Thatcherism.

No party other than Labour can possibly win enough seats to form a
government.

The Liberals and SDP know that. Their hope is to profit from confusion. To

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

divide the non-Conservative vote in such a way as to make them the ‘hook'
in a ‘hung' Parliament and have power far beyond their responsibility.

And, while one of their leaders clearly favours an arrangement to sustain a
Conservative government, the other hasn't the strength to stop him.

That offers no way ahead for a nation that needs to get on with investing for
change, for quality, for confidence in the future.

Proper support for education, strengthened research and development and
long-term, low interest finance for industrial growth are all essential if
Britain is to gain the vitality necessary to outpace competitors who have
been building these assets for years.

They are essential too if we are to generate the wealth needed for the
security, care and opportunity fundamental to the individual freedom of
women and men of all ages and origins. When our country faces the
common pressures on the environment, the common dangers of crime, the
common costs of unemployment, under-investment and under-performance
together, our country has every commonsense reason to meet those
challenges together.

That is democratic socialism in action. And just as a family uses its
combined spirit and resources to overcome crisis, so Britain can once again
make common cause to achieve common good.

Only a Labour government can give that lead. Only we are committed to
such concerted action. Only we believe that the whole nation should win and
can win.

That is why Britain will win, with Labour.

Neil Kinnock
Britain Will Win

Britain is crying out for change. Only a Labour government
can bring it about.

Mending divisions, building new strengths will need determination and
realistic priorities.

Commonsense and the common interest require that the Tory philosophy of
selfishness and short-term gain is replaced by the democratic socialist
philosophy of community and caring, of investment in people and in
production.

We must as a priority tackle the immediate tragedy and waste of

unemployment. We must commit resources to modernising and
strengthening the industries and services that earn Britain a living. We must

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 3 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

ensure the continuity of expansion that is necessary for a lasting economic
recovery.

That is our strategy.

It begins from the understanding that people are Britain's most precious
resource. It is rooted in the confidence that, with the right skills, the right
equipment and the backing of a government that is committed to
encouraging enterprise and innovation, Britain's people can make our
country more efficient, more competitive and more socially just.

It is a message of hope and confidence - the alternative to the divisive and
dictatorial approach of the Conservatives.

We do not believe that everything could or should be done by government.
But we know, from our own history and from the example set by our
competitors, that national economic success cannot be achieved without
government.

Britain will win with a Labour government that invests to enable people to
use their abilities and to stimulate modern training, research, development,
production and marketing. These are the ingredients of economic vitality,
and the foundations of fairness.

The Priority Programme

For our first two years in government we Will concentrate resources on the
essential tasks of combating unemployment and poverty In the course of that
action, we will strengthen the health, housing, education, social services and
crime-fighting services that are vital to social and economic well-being, and
begin to rebuild our manufacturing industry.

Clearly, all other programmes that require substantial public finance must
take lower priority in terms of timescale and public resources.

The Jobs Programme

Immediately after the election the Labour Government will call together a
National Economic Summit to assess fully the condition of the economy
and set the recovery programme in motion - producing the jobs that need to
be done by people who need to do them in a country that wants them done.

The Summit will establish the first stage of the National Economic
Assessment. This will identify the concerted action that will need to be taken
by government, employers in the private and public sectors and trade unions
to increase investment, contain inflation and achieve sustained recovery.

We will reduce unemployment by one million in two years as the first
instalment in beating mass unemployment.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

Half a million jobs will be generated in private industry and in the public
sector by the repairing and building of the houses, the hospitals and schools,
the transport improvements and sewers that the nation needs. This will be
achieved by public investment and by reducing employers' National
Insurance contribution in targeted areas.

Another 360,000 new jobs and training places will be created. These will
provide new skills for young people and adults - with proper opportunities
for women.

A further 300,000 new jobs will improve the health and education services
and the neglected community and caring services. The depleted customs
services will be strengthened in the fight against drugs. The revenue and
benefit departments will be staffed to increase efficiency.

We will extend the voluntary Job Release Scheme to men over 60 so that
those who want to retire early vacate jobs for those who are currently
unemployed. This could take as many as 160,000 people out of
unemployment and into work.

The Anti-Poverty Programme

The spread of poverty in the past eight years has stained the whole nation,
and widened misery and disadvantage amongst old and young. Much of it is
the result of deliberate government policies. Millions of poor people endure
it in despair. Millions who are not poor regard it as a disgrace. The Labour
government will combat poverty directly.

We will immediately increase the single pension by £5 a week and the
pension for a married couple by £8, as the first step in re-establishing a link
between pensions and average earnings or living costs, whichever is the
most favourable to pensioners. We will begin the abolition of the TV licence
fee for pensioners.

We will provide pensioners on supplementary benefit and others on low
incomes with a £5 winter premium to help with fuel bills. We will begin
discussions with the fuel industries with a view to phasing out standing

charges.

We will fully restore the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme as part of
the process of achieving our objective of a pensions level of one-third
average earnings for single people and half average earnings for married
couples.

We will restore and increase the death grant.

We will increase child benefit by £3 a week for all children, raise the
allowance to the first child by £7.36, and increase one- parent family benefit
by £2.20.

We will restore and increase the maternity grant.

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

We will start to phase in a new disability income scheme and provide
resources to give special support to young people with disabilities. Our
special Minister for the Disabled will be put in charge of our programme for
the disabled.

We will extend the long-term supplementary benefit rate to the long-term
unemployed.

We will implement a comprehensive strategy for ending low pay, notably
by the introduction of a statutory national minimum wage. This will be of
particular benefit to women workers, and will help lift families out of
poverty.

The Anti-Crime Programme

We will introduce crime prevention grants for home-owners and tenants.

We will work with the police to get more police on the beat. Uniformed
police officers will be relieved of non-law-and-order tasks which take them
away from crime prevention, pursuit and detection.

We will reverse the Tory cuts in the number of those who can claim criminal
injuries compensation. We will give the Criminal Injuries Compensation
Board more staff to cut the all-time record 64,000 queue awaiting
compensation.

Paying for the Recovery Programme

These immediate programmes will cost £6 billion a year net for the first two
years. We will pay for them by:

¢ Putting directly into generating 300,000 jobs the money that would be
used up by the Thatcher government on its 2p income tax bribe.

e Adopting the same practice as most successful industrial countries and
companies, by prudently borrowing £3 billion for useful wealth
generating national investment.

We will reverse the extra tax cuts which the richest 5 per cent have received
from the Tory government and allocate that money instead to the most
needy. We will also bring forward other reforms to capital taxation -
including the introduction of a wealth tax, which, whilst applying to only the
wealthiest one per cent of the population, will, over the years, bring a
significant contribution from those in our society best able to pay.

Changes Without Charges
Apart from legislating where necessary for the Recovery Programme, the
new Parliament will swiftly enact many other worthwhile measures. These

will cost little to implement but produce significant improvement in the
quality of administration, provision and response to the needs of ordinary

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27
citizens.
They will include:

¢ A Minister for Women, with a place in the Cabinet.

¢ A Freedom of Information Act, to be accompanied by the repeal of
Section Two of the Official Secrets Act.

¢ Parliamentary scrutiny of the Security Services.

¢ Appointment of an Education Ombudsman.

e Appointment of an Ombudsman for Police Complaints.

e An Energy Efficiency Agency to co-ordinate conservation
programmes for domestic and industrial energy users.

e¢ Anew Ministry of Environmental Protection.

Programme for a Firve-Year Parliament

Labour's Programme for Recovery will be the start of a strategy for a full
Parliament. We have to halt the decline in manufacturing industry, not only
to generate jobs and increase our world trade share but to create the wealth
to finance the rescue and expansion of education, health, housing and the
social services.

New Strength for Industry

For eight years British industry has been left to drift and decline Our oil
revenues have been wasted and the City has concentrated upon short-term
movements of capital at the expense of British manufacturing industry. The
huge capital outflow of £110 billion since 1979 is ruinous evidence of the
Tories' lack of concern for the strength of the British economy.

Labour is committed to rebuilding our industrial base. Our country must
make the best use of computers and information technology to develop the
modern means of making a living as the oil runs down and the pressures of
technical change and international competition intensify.

We will:

¢ Establish a capital repatriation scheme using the tax system to attract
and retain British savings and investment in Britain.

¢ Set up the British Industrial Investment Bank, with strong bases in
Scotland, Wales and English regions, to ensure finance for industry
where it is needed, when it is needed and on terms which encourage
long term development.

¢ Implement a dynamic and properly funded regional policy. This will
include the establishment of Regional Development Agencies (starting
with the North, North-West, Yorkshire and Humberside); the
promotion of local and regional enterprise boards; greater scope for
local authorities to participate constructively in economic
development; and creating high technology innovation centres
throughout Britain.

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

¢ Create a new Ministry of Science and Technology to promote a major
increase in research and development.It will co-ordinate the activities
and budgets of government departments involved in these areas and
will encourage, in conjunction with industry and the scientific
community, the full application of science to industrial processes and
products.

e We shall extend social ownership by a variety of means, as set out in
Labour's detailed proposals. In particular, we will set up British
Enterprise, to take a socially owned stake in high-tech industries and
other concerns where public funds are used to strengthen investment.
Social ownership of basic utilities like gas and water is vital to ensure
that every individual has access to their use and that the companies
contribute to Britain's industrial recovery, for instance, by buying
British. We shall start by using the exist mg 49 per cent holding in
British Telecom to ensure proper influence in their decisions. Private
shares in BT and British Gas will be converted into special new
securities. These will be bought and sold in the market in the usual
way and will carry either a guaranteed return, or dividends linked to
the company's growth.

¢ Encourage the establishment and success of co-operatives of all forms.

¢ Strengthen the Department of Trade and Industry as the spearhead of
this new national industrial strategy.

¢ Bring in a stronger regulatory framework to ensure honest practice in
the City of London and introduce new safeguards on mergers,
takeovers and monopolies to protect our national industrial,
technological and research and development interests.

Plan for Training

For modern, wealth-creating industry we need a well-trained workforce.
British industry now carries out less than half of the training of our main
competitors. Labour will therefore establish a national training programme
to bring about a major advance in the spread and standard of skills.

For young people we will establish an integrated, high quality Foundation
Programme that will guarantee for all 16 year olds at least two years of
education, training and work experience according to their needs.

The Adult Skillplan will develop lifelong training and education for
everyone needing to supplement and update skills in work, with particular
emphasis given to training for women.

The Jobs, Enterprise and Training Programme will expand existing

programmes for unemployed people with a guarantee of a job or new skill
for the long-term unemployed.

A Sensible Energy Policy

Efficiency in industry and security in the community both depend on reliable
and safe supplies of energy available at acceptable cost. Britain's oil reserves

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

have a limited life. We have huge reserves of coal which will last for
centuries. Labour's co-ordinated energy programme will ensure the most
sensible use of our reserves while protecting our environ ment and
stimulating employment.

Labour will initiate a major energy conservation programme and ensure
that Britain develops the full potential of its coal, oil and gas resources,
whilst gradually diminishing Britain's dependence upon nuclear energy.

We will invest substantially in research into, and development of, the
renewable energy resources as part of the alternative means of power.

We will not proceed with the building of the proposed Pressurised Water
Reactor at Sizewell.

We share national concern about the problem of nuclear waste. We will
ensure a safe future for Sellafield and develop a new strategy for the
monitoring, storage and disposal of nuclear waste.

Labour will take effective steps to improve the service provided by the
energy industry to energy consumers. These will cover quality of supply,
frequency of metering, general service arrangements and proper provision
for the disabled, those in poverty and others with special needs.

A Prosperous Agriculture

A more efficient agricultural industry can clearly make a valuable
contribution to Britain's recovery. We will support good environmental
practices in agriculture.

To give Britain's producers the backing they need, the burden of agricultural
support must be shifted from consumers. The direction of support must be
shifted away from blanket support for commodities, towards helping the
farmers who need it most, such as those who work in the hills or on marginal
land. To help bring this about we will introduce new, long-term programmes
for agriculture.

We will also help new farmers and young farmers by offering farms to rent.
And we will reverse the cuts in the Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service and research.

Freedom and Fairness for All Britain's People

We are determined to make Britain a fairer and freer society.

To us and to the majority of the British people a civilised community is one
in which citizens band together to provide, out of community resources to
which all contribute, essential services like health, education and pensions
that the great majority of people can not afford to provide for themselves at
time of need.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

When the Tories talk of freedom, they mean freedom for the few, for those
who can afford to buy privilege. What they mean, as their record so plainly
shows, is more tax cuts for the rich and less help for the poor and for that
great majority who are neither rich nor poor.

Labour's objective is to broaden and deepen the liberty of all individuals in
our community: to free people from poverty, exploitation and fear; to free
them to realise their full potential; to see that everyone has the liberty to
enjoy real chances, to make real choices.

It means collective provision for private use. The British people know that
this is the most effective way for them to secure their freedom as individuals
whilst meeting the moral obligations which they feel towards others and
seeing that fairness is a way of national life, not just a fine word.

These values are the essence of our democratic socialism.
Investing in Health

Labour's proudest achievement is the creation of the National Health
Service. The Conservatives voted against it then. All who use and value the
service know only too well how it has been neglected and downgraded by
today's Tories.

Labour will establish the NHS in its rightful place as a high quality service
for the prevention and treatment of illness, free at the time of use to all who
need attention, equipped to meet the changing pressures of need as they
relate, for instance, to an aging population and the requirements of proper
provision for people suffering from mental illness.

The biggest single deficiency in the NHS today is the excessively high
hospital waiting lists which, under the Tories, are increasing year by year.
We shall speedily reduce them by computerising bed allocation,
encouraging more consultants to work full-time for the NHS and targeting
increased resources where waiting lists remain excessive.

The basis of the NHS is the Family Doctor Service We shall act to improve
it, with shorter GP patient lists, more convenient surgery hours, more choice
and information for patients.

We will develop local family health care teams and more local health
centres.

Women's health care has been seriously neglected. Our Charter for
Womens' Health will include a network of Well-Women Clinics, and a
computerised call and recall screening system as a universal service for all
women at risk of cervical and breast cancer. We shall see that all women
have the chance to see a woman doctor if they choose.

We will step up the fight against AIDS by increasing research resources to
find a vaccine or cure and also ensure adequate resources for the supply of

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

drugs capable of arresting the affliction.

We will improve outpatient and emergency facilities and ambulance services
and repair and build hospitals. We intend to improve both the quantity and
quality of services for the National Health. The Tories have increased
prescription charges twelve fold. We will begin to reduce them with the
purpose of securing their eventual abolition.

Labour will ensure that nurses get proper and justified pay increases by right
and regularly, not exceptionally as pre-election sweeteners. Other hospital
staff, on whom the effective running of the service depends, must also be
fairly rewarded as part of the effective health team.

Privatisation means a Health Service run for profit rather than in the patients’
interests. Labour will end privatisation in the NHS, relieve the pressure on
NHS facilities by beginning to phase out pay beds and remove public
subsidies to private health.

A Caring Community

The quality of life of the elderly and of disabled people can and must be
improved by community services. We believe that retirement should be
comfortable and interesting - a time of freedom and choice, not anxiety and
loneliness. We believe that disability should not be a disqualification from
good standards of living and liberty.

Apart from our commitment to higher pensions and the beginning of a new
disablement allowance, Labour will support the National Health Service and
local government in providing more meals on wheels, home helps,
chiropody services and health visitors.

We also recognise the immense contribution of the three million people -
mostly women - who care for their elderly, infirm and disabled relatives at
home. They save the community huge sums of money, often at considerable
sacrifice to themselves. The Labour government will consequently provide a
carer's allowance to give extra help to those who serve their loved ones and
our society so well.

We appreciate and will support voluntary efforts that supplement services
which are essential to the community. We share the view of many who are
engaged in such efforts that they achieve best results working in the context
of high quality public provision.

Education for Britain's Future

Our children are our future. We have a moral and material duty to see that

children and young people are fully equipped to deal with the complexities
and challenges which face them now and which they will meet as citizens;
parents and workers in the future.

They must be provided with a system of education that enables them to

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

control that future. We must see that it is democratic and just, that it is
creative and compassionate, and that it is one in which they can fully exploit
the advantages of science and technology with confidence and in safety.

In pursuit of those objectives, Labour will invest in education so that the
abilities of all children and adults from all home back grounds and in every
part of our country are discovered and nourished.

We will make nursery education available for all three- and four-year-
olds whose parents want this opportunity. We will make provision for
smaller classes and ensure that children have up-to-date books, equipment
and buildings without having to depend on fund-raising for those essentials.

The entitlement to free school meals and the restoration of nutritional
standards are, like the strengthening of the school health service,
commitments which are necessary to safeguard the physical and social
wellbeing of growing children.

We will see that teachers are recognised properly as well qualified
professionals, in their systems of rewards, in the procedures for negotiation
of their employment conditions and in participation in the development of
education.

In addition we shall work with local education authorities to secure a flexible
but clear core curriculum agreed at national level, a School Standards
Council, and a new profile of achievement recording individual progress
through school for all pupils. We will improve links between schools and
home so that parents and teachers act in partnership to foster the best
interests of children.

We shall foster achievement with other policies such as providing proper
funding for the GCSE curriculum and examination, for improved supply of
teachers and equipment for science subjects so that girls as well as boys
increase science learning. There will be maintenance allowances for 16- to
18-year- olds whose family circumstances would other wise impede their
further education.

We will spread the provision of a comprehensive tertiary system of post-
school education.

These policies will all contribute to raising standards of performance in
schools. At the same time as we improve the quality of publicly provided
education, we shall end the 11 plus everywhere and stop the diverting of
precious resources that occurs through the Assisted Places Scheme and the
public subsidies to private schools.

Labour values the research and teaching contribution made by Britain's
higher education system. We will ensure that our universities and
polytechnics get the resources they need to restore and expand the
opportunity for all qualified young people seeking higher education to secure
places. We will ensure that more adults have access to higher education to

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

give them the 'second chance' of personal development

We will also invest in research in higher education, in order to provide the
facilities and opportunities necessary to sustain standards of excellence, to
retain and attract the highest talents and to encourage the industrial and
commercial application of research output.

Education for life through a well-funded adult education service will help to
provide the means by which rapid economic and social change can be
embraced.

Real Choice in Housing

Public funding for housing has fallen by 60 per cent during Mrs Thatcher's
eight years in office. Far fewer homes are being built. Millions of dwellings
are in serious disrepair. Yet there is record unemployment among building
workers. This policy is immoral and grossly inefficient. Labour will reverse
it. We will also improve the quality of housing workmanship and establish a
new system of registration in the construction industry.

We will launch a major housebuilding and public and private sector
housing renovation drive as part of our jobs programme and to combat the
problems of bad housing, over crowding and homelessness. Owner
occupiers will benefit from increased availability of improvement grants.

We will maintain mortgage tax relief, at the standard rate of income tax. To
assist house-purchasers we will introduce a housing 'log book’, giving each
dwelling's history, condition and construction so that purchasers will know
exactly what they are buying. This will be transferred with the sale.

For council tenants, we will maintain the right to buy. Local authorities, at
present limited by the Tories in using the receipts from council house sales,
will be required to use these proceeds to invest in new housing. For the
millions who choose to remain council tenants, we will give a legal right to
be consulted about rents, charges, repair and improvement programmes.
Tenants' associations will be given representation in the decision-making
structure and a say in spending budgets on their estates.

Groups of tenants who want to take over the running of their homes will
have the right to set up management co-operatives.

Leaseholders who own their homes will be given the legal right to acquire
their freeholds at fair prices and without the costly current impediments to
that right. Leaseholders in flats will get the legal right to hire and fire the
managing agents in blocks of flats. They will be empowered to have the
freeholder's accounts examined by an auditor of their choice and be given
the legal right to extend their lease.

Security of tenure will be protected for private tenants. These tenants will be
given a legal right to get repairs done.

Protecting Our People

The Thatcher government has broken its promises on law and order. Last
year 4,311,000 crimes were committed in Britain. The clear-up rate fell to 32
per cent. Millions of women are scared to go out at night. Many old people
lock themselves into their homes. Drug trafficking is increasing.

Labour will take urgent action to make people safer.
Our crime prevention programme will:

¢ Help local councils to implement a Safer Streets policy, with more
street-lighting, more caretakers, park-keepers and other public
employees whose presence deters crime.

¢ Bring in a Safe Estates Policy, assisting councils to provide stronger
locks, stouter doors and vandal-proof windows for tenants and home-
owners - especially older citizens - who have difficulty in meeting the
costs of such security improvements.

¢ Introduce a Safer Transport policy, to protect passengers and crews,
including better services, especially at night, adequate staffing, better
sited bus stops and well-lit stations with alarm buttons.

e Lay down crime prevention standards for buildings, open spaces and
vehicles to combat vandalism and to deter criminals.

¢« Combat violence against women - specially domestic violence - by
seeing that the laws that already exist against beating and abuse are
vigorously enforced.

Our victim support programme will fund a national network of victim
support schemes, providing practical help to victims of all crime, ranging
from victims of rape and child abuse to mugging and burglary victims.

We shall assist family and support groups in their efforts to work with
professionals in the health, education and other services and within the
community to deal with the great and growing problem of drug abuse.

Locally elected police authorities will be given clear statutory responsibility
with the police to enforce the law and uphold the Queen's peace. The police
themselves will remain responsible for all operational matters.

Fraud in the City of London is a serious crime. Too many get away with it.
Labour will bring in effective regulation by establishing an independent
statutory commission.

Making Travel Easier

Efficient, inexpensive public transport is essential in any society. Tory
policies have made travel more difficult by cutting services and pushing up
fares. Deregulation of buses has brought chaos to many parts of the country
both in towns and cities and in the rural areas where efficient and cheap
public transport is so important.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 14 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

Labour will invest to co-ordinate and improve bus and rail services, which
will improve travel and reduce congestion. There will be Local Transport
Plans for every area.

Action will be taken to keep fares down. There will be good concessionary
fare schemes for local travel for pensioners and people with disabilities.

We shall promote services for those with special needs, such as dial-a-ride
and taxicard schemes offering cheap travel for the disabled.

We shall invest to ensure a continuing future for British Rail Engineering as
a high-quality supplier both for British Rail and to world markets.

A Safter Environment

The countryside and the urban areas all suffer from pollution and the misuse
of the environment. Labour will establish a Ministry of Environmental
Protection to take positive action to safeguard the quality and safety of life.

We will:

e Set up an Environmental Protection Service and a Wildlife and
Countryside Service.

e Extend the planning system to cover agricultural forestry and water
developments requiring them, and industry, to take account of
environmental considerations.

¢ Invest more in land reclamation and cleaning up, in recycling and
conservation, in development of new products, processes and
pollution control equipment. This will not only make the country
cleaner but will create jobs as well.

e Take action to deal with acid rain.

¢ Stop radio-active discharges into our seas and oppose the dumping of
nuclear waste at sea.

¢ Provide for better monitoring, inspection and enforcement of pollution
control, to cover areas ranging from air pollution to beaches, from
hazardous chemicals to food additives, and from water quality to
vehicle emissions.

¢ Protect green belts and other specially designated areas.

e Bring in a new Wildlife and Countryside Act and provide for public
access to all common land, mountain, moor and heath.

e End all forms of organised hunting with hounds. Special account will
be taken of the conditions applying in National Parks. These changes
will not affect shooting and fishing.

¢ Update animal protection legislation - for example, to eliminate
unnecessary experimenting on live animals.

Strengthening Democracy

We will seek to strengthen parliamentary democracy and introduce state aid
for political parties, along the lines of the Houghton Report.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 15 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

We shall establish a new democratically-elected strategic authority for
London and consult widely about the most effective regional structure of
government and administration in England and Wales.

Scotland

We shall legislate in the first Parliamentary session to establish a
democratically-elected Scottish Assembly in Edinburgh. This will have a
wide range of powers over health, education and housing and over
significant aspects of industrial and economic policy. It will take
responsibility for changes in the structure of Scottish local government.

Wales

Wales and the Welsh economy will clearly benefit from Labour's programme
for investment in jobs and vital services. In addition, the Welsh
Development Agency will be given greater powers and funds and there will
be a new Wales Economic Planning Council. Welsh agriculture will benefit
from our measures to help the livestock farmers especially the marginal and
hill farmers.

A separate Arts Council for Wales will be established and the development
of the use and choice of the Welsh language will be encouraged.

Northern Ireland

Labour's policies for economic renewal are essential to combat the record
unemployment and social deprivation in Northern Ireland and to encourage
the economic security which is fundamental to the development of harmony
and trust in the community.

We believe in a united Ireland: to be achieved peacefully, democratically,
and by consent. We consequently support the Anglo-Irish Agreement and
its commitment that there should be no change in the constitutional position
of Northern Ireland without the con sent of the majority of the people who
live there. No group or party will be allowed to exercise a veto on political
development, or on policies designed to win consent.

We will combat para-military violence from wherever it comes. We will
promote discussions aimed at encouraging mutual confidence and
eliminating conflict whilst ensuring that the respective identities and basic
rights of both communities will be protected. We will replace present strip-
searching practice with more effective and acceptable security measures.

Local Democracy

The Tory government has undermined local democracy and plans to
continue to diminish the importance of votes in local elections.

It has made huge cuts in rate support grant and imposed financial penalties to

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

prevent councils maintaining and improving the quality of essential local
services. Employment, and sensible and sensitive investment in local
communities and their services, have been damaged.

Labour will restore the right of councils to decide their own policies and
plans, which will be subject to the decisions of local people at annual local
elections.

We will halt the cuts in rate support grant and end financial penalties. We
will make the legal liabilities of councillors similar to those of Ministers and
Company Directors by ending surcharge and disqualification except for
criminal offences.

We will abolish the Rates Act and repeal the legislation which established
the poll tax in Scotland.

We will give local authorities the necessary powers to enable them to build
on existing successful initiatives for enterprise and employment, to develop
new technologies and to train young people.

Labour will examine the structure of local government to ensure that it is
democratic and effective. We will establish a new Quality Commission to
ensure the spread of ‘best practice’, efficiency and high standards of local
authority provision and response to the public.

New Life for Inner Cities

Except where it has turned areas over to speculators so that they can create
luxury accommodation at astronomical prices, this government has left
inner-city areas to rot.

Experience has shown that the Conservatives' City Action Teams have never
had the means or the purpose of making any real impact on inner city
problems.

Tory cuts in funding and in housing, together with mass unemployment,
have turned too many of our urban areas into dingy, hopeless places.

Yet the people who live there, given the chance, have the zest and initiative
to make these areas thrive socially and economically.

Labour will launch a drive against inner-city deprivation both as a way of
generating employment and as a means of making such areas safer and
better places to live.

Labour's approach will be to develop the partnership between central and
local government, with the direct participation of the voluntary and private

sectors.

We will:

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

* Give local authorities in key areas the power to declare Public Action
Zones. In these areas, local councils will have additional resources
and powers to undertake programmes of investment. Land will be
identified for housing, jobs and amenities and extra government
resources allocated to help with comprehensive regeneration. Local
people will be fully consulted about their needs and ideas.

¢ Strengthen the Urban Programme and Partnership Schemes.

¢ Make Urban Development Grants available for local needs.

¢ Increase resources for reclaiming derelict land.

Rural Area

Under the Tories, the problems of the rural areas have become steadily more
serious - the lack of jobs, the poor housing, and the loss of buses, post
offices, shops and schools.

Labour will give our rural communities the chance to thrive again. Our
policies include better public transport, new mobile facilities for health
care and social services and extra help to keep open local schools and post
offices.

Enhancing Rights, Increasing Freedom

Under the Conservatives, Britain has become a harsher place. Freedoms
built up over generations have been weakened or removed. Labour will

restore and enhance those freedoms in a Britain where life can be more

pleasant and fulfilling.

We believe that positive steps are needed to help women and ethnic
minorities get a fair deal, and to attain more democracy in the workplace. In
addition, we will take steps to ensure that homosexuals are not discriminated
against.

Women's Rights

More than half of Britain's people - the women of our country - are still
denied many essential rights. Labour's Ministry for Women will make sure
that, in framing their policies, all government departments listen and respond
to women's needs and concerns.

In particular, women must have the right to work and equal rights at work.
In addition to our new provision for training opportunities and protection
against discrimination, Labour will help the large number of women who are
part-time workers. We will legislate for them to have the same hourly rates,
rights to sick pay, paid holidays and job security as full-time workers.

We will give homeworkers the status and rights of employees; introduce
effective laws for equal pay for work of equal value; provide better-paid
leave for parents when their child is born; and encourage a shorter, more
flexible working week.

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

Democracy in the Workplace

Workers' rights have been eroded, or in some cases removed entirely, during

the Thatcher years. Labour's policy for new rights and responsibilities means
legislation to foster good industrial relations and democratic participation in

industry and trade unions. We believe that the law should be used to enlarge,
not diminish, the freedom of workers to control their environment.

We will:

¢ Replace Tory legislation that gives employers and non-unionists the
means to frustrate legitimate trade union activity. New laws will
strengthen the legal rights of representation, bargaining and trade
unionism that are essential in a modern democracy.

¢ Improve the protection available against unfair dismissal. We shall
make the legislation apply from the time of employment.
Reinstatement will be the normal outcome of a successful finding of
unfair treatment. We will ensure that justice is done in cases where
miners have been unfairly dismissed.

e Extend employment protection to all workers, including part-timers.

¢ Improve statutory protection in respect of health and safety at work.

¢ Restore provision for fair pay, such as the Fair Wages Resolution,
Schedule 11 of the 1975 Employment Protection Act and the powers
of the Wages Councils.

¢ Strengthen ACAS to put more emphasis on conciliation and
arbitration.

e Take steps to develop stable and effective negotiating machinery,
promote trade union membership and organisation, and encourage
union recognition by employers.

¢ Restore the right to belong to a trade union to every employee -
including those at GCHQ.

e Ensure that the law guarantees the essential legal freedom of workers
and their unions to organise effective industrial action.

¢ Provide a statutory framework of measures to underpin the
participative rights of union members, for example by laying down
general principles for inclusion in union rule books. These will be
based on a right for union members to have a secret ballot on
decisions relating to strikes, and for the method of election of union
executives to be based on a system of secret ballots.

¢ In consultation with the TUC, we will establish a new independent
tribunal, presided over by a legally-qualified person. This will have
the duty of acting on complaints by union members if they consider
that these statutory principles have been breached.

Equality for Ethnic Minorities

All the people of this country - whatever their race, colour or religion - must
enjoy the full rights of citizenship.

Our policies for employment, education, housing, health care, local

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 19 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

government and much else will clearly be of benefit to people of the ethnic
minorities as they will be to the whole community.

In addition, Labour will take firm action to promote racial equality, to
attack racial discrimination and to encourage contract compliance and other
positive means of ensuring equity for all citizens. We will strengthen the law
on public order to combat racial hatred and take firm action against the
growing menace of racial attacks. We will make prosecution easier in order
to encourage the reporting of offences.

Labour's policy of firm and fair immigration control will ensure that the
law does not discriminate on the basis of race, colour or sex.

A Better Deal for Consumers

When people make a purchase, they often feel they are treated unfairly, or
even cheated. Labour's Charter for Consumers will provide proper
safeguards suited to modern conditions.

There will be firmer protection against unsafe goods. We will make
producers strictly liable for defective products.

We will provide easier means of redress for purchasers and stiffer penalties
to deter illegal practices.

We will take action to make sure that public bodies respond better to the
needs and complaints of people who use their services.

We will bring in a statutory code of advertising practice. There will be
powers to order the correction of misleading advertisements.

We will improve access to legal services where necessary.

There will be more safeguards for customers when companies go bankrupt.
Towards a Fuller Life

Life is not only work. Labour will make pro vision for the co-ordination and
development of leisure amenities and the leisure and cultural industries.

Our Support Sport programme will provide more resources for physical
education and training through more playing fields and facilities, better
equipment and well-trained teachers and instructors. We will nourish special
talents and encourage wider participation in sport.

We will encourage schools to open up their recreational facilities to the
whole community and prevent the selling off of school and other sports

grounds.

We will set up a Sports Trust to channel resources into the development of
community sporting facilities and the attraction of major international

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 20 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

sporting events to Britain.

We will establish a Ministry for the Arts and Media with responsibility for
the arts, crafts, public libraries, museums, film, publishing, the press, the
record industry, the development of broadcasting and access to it, fashion,
design, architecture and the heritage. The Home Office will remain
responsible for regulatory and statutory powers in relation to broadcasting.

The development of central and local government support for the arts,
culture and entertainment is essential to the extension of choice, access and
participation, and to the development of the related industries.

We will protect the independence of the BBC and the independent
broadcasting organisations. We reject subscription TV for the BBC and the
auctioning of ITV franchises.

We will legislate to ensure that ownership and control of the press and
broadcasting media are retained by citizens of Britain and to place limits on
the concentration of owner ship. We will strengthen the Press Council and
set up a launch fund to assist new publications in order to encourage the
diversity necessary in a healthy democracy.

Modern Britain in a Modern World

The globe is torn by strife and oppression A Labour Britain must play its
part in promoting freedom and reducing conflict.

Labour will play a full part in the United Nations Organisation and the
Commonwealth.

Under the Conservatives, Britain picks and chooses which authoritarian
countries to condemn and which to befriend. Labour will stand up for
freedom wherever it is oppressed - whether in Eastern Europe, Latin
America, Asia or Africa.

The Thatcher government has made no real effort to foster freedom in South
Africa and Namibia. Labour will make the arms embargo complete, halt
investment and commercial loans and ensure that British measures against
apartheid embrace those already adopted by the US Congress, the
Commonwealth and the EEC. We will support the imposition by the UN
Security Council of comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions and
provide help to the Front Line States who bear the brunt of South African
military and economic attack.

We uphold the principle that it is wrong for one country to dominate or
threaten another. We oppose the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. We oppose
United States intervention in Nicaragua and the financing and arming of the
Contra terrorists.

Labour will actively seek a stable peace in the Middle East which protects
the security of Israel and recognises the right of Palestinians to self-

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 21 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

determination.

Labour supports genuine guarantees for the independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Cyprus and supports the efforts of the United Nations
to achieve that.

We support the human rights movement throughout the world. We champion
the demand for free trade unions in Poland. We will press the Russians to
honour their obligations under international human rights agreements.

International terrorism is a growing menace to liberty and security. Labour is
firmly committed to strengthening national provision and international co-
operation in combating and defeating it.

Labour's aim is to work constructively with our EEC partners to promote
economic expansion and combat unemployment. However, we will stand up
for British interests within the European Community and will seek to put an
end to the abuses and scandals of the Common Agricultural Policy. We shall,
like other member countries, reject EEC interference with our policy for
national recovery and renewal.

Defending Our Country

Labour has a proud record of acting in defence of Britain. It was a Labour
government which helped to establish the North Atlantic Alliance. It was a
Labour government which in the 1970s put resources into rebuilding the
Royal Navy and equipping the Royal Air Force with the most up-to-date
aircraft.

At the same time, Labour has always linked necessary defence with the need
to reduce hostility between East and West. We must be alert in protecting our
country and equally alert in helping to keep away the scourge of war and
nuclear destruction.

The incoming Labour government will maintain that record of effective
defence whilst working to lower international tension, fear and distrust.

Labour's defence policy is based squarely and firmly on Britain's
membership of NATO. We are determined to make the most useful possible
contribution to the alliance. We can best do that by concentrating our
resources on the non-nuclear needs of our army, navy and air force.

The Polaris system of nuclear delivery is ageing and will soon be obsolete.
The Tories are buying the expensive American Trident system - a policy
which increases nuclear armament without increasing security and, at the
same time, diminishes our effective defences. Trident's cost of up to £10
billion will take up so much of our defence budget as to deny modern and
necessary equipment to our front line forces. Indeed, this process is already
happening.

Labour rejects this dishonest and expensive policy. We say that it is time to

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 22 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

end the nuclear pretence and to ensure a rational conventional defence policy
for Britain.

So Labour will decommission the obsolescent Polaris system. We will
cancel Trident and use the money saved to pay for those improvements for
our army, navy and airforce which are vital for the defence of our country
and to fulfil our role in NATO. We will maintain a 50-frigate and destroyer
navy. We will play a full part in the development of the European Fighter
Aircraft. We will invest in the best up-to-date equipment for the British
Army of the Rhine.

That commitment to conventional defence will be based wherever possible
on buying British-made rather than foreign equipment. This policy will
provide greater security for workers in our vital industries like aerospace,
shipbuilding and engineering where jobs are in danger from the reductions
which the Tories are making in conventional defence.

We have always recognised that a properly negotiated and monitored
international agreement to remove nuclear weapons from European soil
would provide the most effective guarantee against the horrors of nuclear
war. It would be the most significant step towards an eventual worldwide
renunciation of, and ban upon, nuclear weapons. That is why we were the
first to propose to the superpowers the zero option in respect of intermediate
nuclear weapons.

Labour therefore strongly supports the talks between the United States and
Soviet governments aimed at reducing nuclear armaments. Success in these
efforts to negotiate the removal of all intermediate nuclear missiles in
Europe would be warmly welcomed. It would mean the removal of
America's Cruise missiles here in Britain and in the rest of Europe, as well as
Pershing IIs in Germany and the Soviet SS20s and other shorter-range
missiles.

We naturally, therefore, want to assist that process in every way possible. If,
however, it should fail we shall, after consultation, inform the Americans
that we wish them to remove their cruise missiles and other nuclear weapons
from Britain. We would then become the ninth - of the sixteen NATO
members - which do not have US nuclear weapons on their territory. This
change would, of course, not affect the other US, British and joint defence
and early warning systems in the United Kingdom.

We will oppose the extension of the arms race into outer space and will seek
an international agreement to abolish chemical weapons.

The War We Must Fight

The world is aware, as never before, of the horrors of famine and poverty in
many countries. A Labour Britain will play its full part in defeating these
scourges.

We will set up a Department of Overseas Development and Co-operation,

http://labourmanifesto.com/1987/1987-labour-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 13:27

Page 23 of 24

1987 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

headed by a Cabinet Minister. We will double Britain's aid budget in order
to achieve the United Nations' target of 0.7 per cent of national income
within five years. We will restore funding for development education. We
will give greater support to voluntary agencies. We will promote
international action to lift the burden of Third World debt and improve the
trading conditions of the developing countries.

In all of our policies for making our aid commitment more effective we shall
consult the agencies and the men and women of the communities that use the
aid to help to win their freedom from want and poverty.

Britain will Win with Labour

On June 11, the people of Britain have the opportunity to put behind them
the bleak years of Thatcherism and to give our country a fresh start Labour's
plans, carefully costed, prudently programmed, can provide that start.

To go on under Toryism is to accept lower expectations and narrower
horizons: it is to surrender to national decline and national division.

We must not shackle ourselves or burden our children with that future of
failure. Together, we can be successful not just in material and economic
terms, though these are vitally important, but also in terms of our sense of
purpose, our freedom, independence and confidence.

That success can come only when the nation is restored to strength and unity
in their fullest sense.

Labour has the policies to generate efficient production and secure high
standards of justice. Labour has the vision and commitment to stimulate the
energies, the skills and the will to succeed of the British people.

In our precious democratic tradition, a general election passes power back
from Parliament to the people. We urge the people to use their power in their

own interests, their families' interests, their country's interests.

Britain will win with Labour.

1992 Labour Party Manifesto

 

It's time to get Britain working again
Winter ending

‘A cold coming we had of it!

huddled together in cardboard cities,
crouched over shared books in leaking classrooms,
crammed into peeling waiting-rooms,
ice stamped into crazy-paving

round polluted streams.

Winter ending:

paintings, poems bud hesitantly,
tentative chords behind boarded facades;
factories open like daffodils,

trains flex frozen rheumatic joints,
computer-screens blink on

in the sudden daylight.

As the last cardboard boxes

are swept away beneath busy bridges,
the cold blue landscape of winter
suddenly alive with bright red roses.

1992 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

This general election is a choice between a Conservative government
paralysed by recession, and a Labour government determined to get on with
building recovery.

Gripped by the longest recession since the war, Britain needs a government
with a clear sense of direction and purpose. A government with the people
and the policies to get Britain working again and to achieve sustained
recovery - strength with staying power.

Labour will be such a government.

But this election is not only a choice between policies, important though
both are. It is also a choice between values.

At the core of our convictions is belief in individual liberty.
We therefore believe:

First, that for liberty to have real meaning the standards of community
provision must be high and access to that provision must be wide.

Second, that those rights of the individual must, like all others in a free
society, belong to all men and women of every age, class and ethnic origin
and be balanced by responsibilities of fair contribution and law-abiding
conduct.

Third, that for rights and responsibilities to be exercised fully and fairly,
government in Britain as in other industrialised democracies, must work to
build prosperity by properly supporting research, innovation, the
improvement of skills, the infrastructure and long-term industrial
development.

Our vision for Britain is founded on these values. Guided by them, we will
make our country more competitive, creative, and just; more secure against
crime, aggression and environmental danger. We want government to serve
the whole nation - using its power to realise this vision.

Labour will be such a government.

These are our convictions and we will work to fulfil them. They are also
down-to-earth aims - essential objectives in a country hit by recession,
suffering run-down public services and facing the intensifying pressures of
European and global economic competition.

MI of those realities require that the government provides: a stable economic
environment; education and training that fosters the abilities of all young
people and adults; a firm emphasis on productive investment in both the
public and private sectors.

Labour will implement and maintain those policies. They are vital for

prosperity, for consistently low inflation and for continuous improvement in
economic performance and living standards. They are also fundamental to

http://labourmanifesto.com/1992/1992-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 17

1992 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

improving the quality and quantity of provision in health and social services,
and to combating poverty We have absolute commitment to a high-quality
National Health Service, free at time of need and not fractured and
weakened by underfunding and a commercialised contract system. We will
get on with fulfilling that commitment from the moment of our election - by
strengthening and modernising the NHS, by extending care in the
community and by establishing the National Health Initiative to prevent
illness.

Our pledges to increase the income of pensioners and families with children
will urgently be fulfilled. Our undertakings to stop the perpetual experiments
in schools and to raise standards of investment and achievement in education
will be kept in full.

These policies - like those to increase house-building, improve transport and
protect the environment - are not only important to the well-being of the
British people now. They are vital preparations for the future. In that future,
we are determined that Britain will be a leader in the New Europe, setting
higher standards and not surrendering influence by opting out. We have
confidence in our country and in the qualities and potential of its people. We
want to nourish their artistic, scientific, sporting and other abilities. And we
want to enhance their democratic power too. We shall therefore make
constitutional and other changes that will give renewed vitality to our
democracy.

We shall empower people as citizens and as consumers of public and private
services. We will strengthen equality before the law and equality of
opportunity for the majority of the population -women. Neither their legal
status nor their chances in education, training and employment are full or
free. We will ensure that the barriers to fairness are removed.

These policies, like many others, manifest our practical commitment to
freedom. That purpose is not confined to the shores of our country. In an age
where liberty has made great advances in the world, there is still conflict,
instability and want, causing great misery and inhibiting the peace and co-
operation which we want to help to build. We shall, therefore ensure that our
country has the defence capacity, the strength of alliance and the peace-
making commitment necessary to safeguard the United Kingdom, to
participate in international negotiations for disarmament, to deter aggression
and to contribute to constructing a New World Order, now feasible through
the strengthened United Nations.

In our relations with the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe as
well as with the poverty-stricken peoples of the South, we will work from
the principle that political freedom needs the sure foundation of economic
security. In this increasingly inter-dependent world there are no distant
crises. The Labour government will therefore, as a matter of moral
obligation and in the material interests of our country, foster the
development and trade relationships necessary for the advance of economic
security, political democracy and respect for human rights.

The United Kingdom has been through 13 years in which unemployment has
more than doubled, irreplaceable assets have been wasted, markets at home
and abroad have been lost, manufacturing investment has fallen, poverty has
increased, the crime rate has rocketed, and talents have been neglected.

Now our country faces clear alternatives.

A Conservative government would mean a repeat of the same, stale policies
which brought economic insecurity, privatised and underfunded public
services and increased social division. The Conservatives have no policies
which would mean sustained recovery, higher health care or improved
educational standards. The arrogance remains which brought us the poll tax,
centralisation in Britain and isolation in Europe.

If they can't get it right in 13 years, they never will.

The Labour government will mean a fresh start for Britain. It will mean
strong and continued emphasis on investment for economic strength. It will
mean action to help families, fair taxation, incentives for enterprise and
support for essential community services.

It will mean greater freedom, securitv and opportunity. It will mean change
for the better.

It's time to make that change.

It's time for Labour.

Immediate Action for National Recovery

Britain faces a huge task of national reconstruction. From day one, the new
government must start to get Britain working again. It must get the economy
out of recession, it must lay foundations for the future. Recovery must be
based on investment, for only investment will create lasting prosperity.

Today. millions of people fear losing their job, their home or their business.
The new Labour government's National Recovery Programme will start to
remove that fear with immediate action on investment. jobs and training. It
will combat recession now and build sustained and sustainable recovery for
the future.

Britain's economic problems are deep-seated. We will not be able to do at
once everything that we would like to do. But we will get down to business

right away. And as with any properly-run business. our immediate
programme will be part of a strategy for long-term success.

Action for industry

1. We will provide enhanced capital allowances to encourage companies
immediately to bring forward manufacturing investment in new machinery

http://labourmanifesto.com/1992/1992-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 17

1992 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

and plant, innovation and design. This will last for a limited period.

2. We will introducc an investment tax incentive tailored to the special needs
of small businesses.

3. We will immediately begin the phased release of receipts from the sale of
council houses land and property receipts to allow local authorities to build
new homes and improve old ones. More building workers in the recession-
savaged construction and building supply industries will be employed and
more families rehoused. Equivalent arrangements will be made in Scotland.

4. We will allow British Rail to proceed with a leasing scheme of 188 new
Networker trains on the North Kent line - the first step in securing private
investment to help modernise Britain's railways and protect our
environment.

Action for jobs

5. Housing investment will generate jobs. We will also establish a work
programme combining three days a week work for the unemployed - paid at
the proper rate - with two days' training and job seeking. This will benefit the
community and ensure that unemployed people are offered a range of
employment and training opportunities. The programme which can be
quickly and easily established will allow us to start bringing down
unemployment immediately. Our aim is to prevent long-term unemployment
rather than just trying to cope with it after it has occurred

Action for skills and schools

6. We will restore last year's training cuts which caused so much damage to
training for young people and the unemployed. We will establish a new
cash-limited Skills for the 90s fund with an initial budget of £300 million, to
upgrade the training of those in work. Investment will be targeted
particularly at areas of skill shortages and will give people who are now
unskilled the chance to acquire basic skills.

7. Over the next 22 months, additional resources of at least £600 million will

be available for investment in education. Amongst other projects, this will
help to tackle equipment shortages and the backlog of school repairs.

Action for the NHS

Over the next 22 months. additional at least £1 billion will be available for
investment in the National Health Service. This will help the NHS to make
real advances in care and treatment.

Action for children

9. We will start to increase nursery education places for three and four year
olds by making sure that local councils actually use the money they receive

http://labourmanifesto.com/1992/1992-labour-manifesto.shtml

13/06/2024, 13:27

Page 5 of 17

1992 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

for nursery education to create new places and by switching capital funds
earmarked for the City Technology College programmes. This will lead to
the rapid creation of 25,000 new places.

10. We will extend the exemption from tax which applies to workplace
nurseries to all forms of employer assistance with childcare.

Getting results

Every action we propose makes sense by itself. Together our proposals add
up to a co-ordinated programme for recovery.

By investing in house-building and repairs, we start to rehouse homeless
people.

By investing in public transport, we start to transform commuters' lives and
create a cleaner environment.

By investing in the NHS, we offer new security to the patients and the
public.

By investing in education we nourish the talents of children and lay the basis
for future success.

With each step we employ more workers in industries from construction and
computer software to high-tech engineering printing and publishing. We
enable businesses to thrive. We save taxpayers' money on benefits. We
transform unemployment claimants into employed contributors.

Labour's programme for national recovery will this year help bring Britain
out of recession. Public investment will modernise services help business
and industry and stimulate private investment. It will make you and your
family better off.

Building a strong economy

Labour's economic policy rests on one simple, commonsense fact. The only
way for Britain to build a strong economy is to make the goods and services
which people at home and abroad want to buy

Britain is in a race for economic survival and success. Faced with intense
competition, companies and countries can succeed only by constantly
improving their performance. Every employee in every enterprise must be
involved in a new partnership so that trained and talented people can use the
most modern technologies to create top-quality products.

But none of this will happen with a government that believes that the best
thing is to do nothing. Three thousand men and women have lost their jobs
on every working day since John Major became Prime Minister. Every week
900 businesses go bankrupt. Every dav 200 families lose their homes.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1992/1992-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 17

1992 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

The Conservatives have created the longest recession for 60 years. They
have no idea how to get us out of it and even less idea how to stay out of it.
Britain needs a Labour government which will back British industry in the
way our competitors back theirs.

A government which business can do business with

Modern government has a strategic role not to replace the market but to
ensure that the market works properly. Other competitors in Europe and
elsewhere recognise that industrial policy must be at the heart of economic
policy. It is the government's responsibility to create the conditions for
enterprise to thrive.

Business needs sustained and balanced growth, with stable exchange rates,
steady and competitive interest rates and low inflation. We will deliver them.

Business must have a high level of education science and skills. Incentives
for high-tech investment. Modern transport.

Strong regional economies for new developments. We will deliver them.

We will keep prices down

Inflation has been suppressed by recession. But it has not been cured.

To curb inflation. Labour will maintain the value of the pound within the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism. We will manage credit sensibly. We
will stop excessive price rises in water, electricity, telephones, transport and
NHS prescriptions.

The only way to defeat inflation in the medium term is to raise productivity
substantially. By promoting investment and improving skills we will tackle
the underlying causes of inflation.

We will introduce fair taxes

Attacking poverty is an essential component of Labour's programme for
national recovery and prosperity. The most effective way to reduce poverty
quickly is to increase child benefit and pensions and take low-paid people
out of taxation. To achieve these goals, we will reform the national insurance
and income tax system.

We will increase child benefit to £9.95 a week for all children with the full
value going to every family. This measure will benefit seven million families
and is worth £127.40 a year to a family with two children.

We will increase the basic retirement pension by an extra £5 a week for a
single person and £8 for a married couple. All pensioners will receive the
full increase which will also go to widows and others on benefits linked by
statute to the basic pension level. Twelve million people will benefit.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1992/1992-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 17

1992 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

We will abolish the two per cent national insurance contribution on earnings
under £54 a week - effectively a £56 annual entry fee into the national
insurance system.

At present employees earning less than £405 a week pay contributions on all
their earnings, while above that level no contributions are paid at all. This is
an unfair anomaly in our tax structure. The ceiling on contributions will
therefore be abolished.

We will take 740,000 taxpayers out of taxation altogether by increasing the
personal allowance and wife's earned income allowance by more than
inflation. Married couples will have the option of splitting the married
couple's allowance between them as they choose.

The basic rate of tax will remain unchanged at 25 per cent, as will the 40 per
cent rate. A new top rate income tax of 50 per cent will apply to individuals
with an income of at least £40,000 this year.

Labour's tax and benefit changes are self-financing. They are fair. And they
will make every individual employee on earnings up to at least £22,000 a
year better off.

We will reform decision-making

Britain urgently needs a better way of making economic decisions.
Government must decide at the same time how much to spend and how to
pay for spending. The Budget should decide both.

Every autumn, we will make a State of the Nation report on the British
economy. Our national economic assessment will then allow employers,
trade unions and other social partners to consider Britain's competitiveness
and the competing claims on national output. These considerations will be
an important influence on collective bargaining.

In order to provide honest information about the state of the British
economy, we will make the Central Statistical Office independent and free
from political interference.

We will halt the deterioration which has taken place in the pay and
conditions of many public service workers - often through pay settlements
which have been arbitrarily imposed upon them. We will seek fairer and
more rational ways of determining public sector pay within clearly defined
budget limits.

We will cut unemployment

We are determined to make a swift reduction in unemployment and have
explained in our National Recovery Programme just how this will be done.
It includes immediate action for unemployed people, as well as direct
investment - for instance, in construction - to create thousands of new jobs.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1992/1992-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 17

1992 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

Steady and sustained economic growth will generate jobs that last. Better
training will help people get back to work.

Unemployment must be tackled by the European Community as a whole. We
will use our influence in Europe to secure the necessary policies for co-
ordinated growth.

We will modernise Britain's industries

It is time to rebuild Britain's industrial strength. For lasting recovery, Britain
needs a modern industrial policy designed to build skills, upgrade
technology, encourage industry in every region and expand exports.

An Investment Decade for Britain will start with the immediate introduction
of enhanced investment allowances (see page 9). We will help Britain's high-
technology industries with a 25% tax credit for additional investment in
research and development. Small firms will be assisted with a new
investment scheme, combining a cash-limited fund for new investments with
tax incentives tailored to heir special needs.

Britain's industrial future depends on transforming our inventive genius into
manufacturing strength. Labour will work with industry to establish British
Technology Enterprise and create Technology Trusts throughout Britain,
building bridges between industries and universities and helping firms turn
good ideas into commercial products. We will encourage the development of
the most modern telecommunications networks.

Labour's Minister for Science will develop a national strategy to promote
high-quality science and technology, so that Britain can better anticipate and
respond to the challenges of the future.

All over the world, industries face unprecedented environmental challenges.
We will support new research into environmentally-friendly technologies
and launch a Great Environment Exhibition to publicise and to promote sales
of the cleanest British technologies.

We will strengthen our regional economies

We will establish new Regional Development Agencies in England,
strengthen Scottish Enterprise and the Welsh Development Agency and
modernise regional incentives. Regional agencies will become powerhouses
for industrial development, encouraging investment, technology and skills.
The Scottish Parliament will have a vital role in building the competitive
strength of the Scottish economy. Our new Welsh Assembly will also have
important economic responsibilities.

Labour's National Investment Bank, operating on strictly commercial lines,
will bring public and private sector together to invest in long-term regional
and national infrastructure projects.

Small and growing businesses will have a new deal. As well as the lowest

http://labourmanifesto.com/1992/1992-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 17

1992 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

possible interest rates, they need the backing on which their competitors can
rely in France and Germany. Labour will establish a network of one-stop
advice centres providing them with access to high-quality specialist
assistance.

We will give special attention to the establishment of small businesses by
women, and members of the ethnic minority communities, who often face
difficulties raising venture capital.

Under the Conservatives, Britain has moved from manufacturing trade
surplus to manufacturing trade deficit. The recent privatisation of the Export
Credit Guarantee Department can only do further damage. Labour will
create modern export services for the nation and the regions.

We will invest in modern transport

Commuters and companies need fast, safe transport Labour will act to make
sure they get it. It is absurd that French Railways can raise funds for new
investment in the City of London, when British Rail is not allowed to do so.
We will remove these restrictions. Leasing schemes will allow large-scale
investments to be financed at relatively little cost to the public sector
borrowing requirement.

Private finance will also be mobilised for a high-speed rail network which
will eventually link every region to the Channel Tunnel with proper
environmental safeguards.

We will improve energy supplies

Families, commerce and industry need heat, light and power at prices they,
can afford. Britain is well placed with reserves of coal, oil and gas which
must be husbanded in a national energy policy to balance the needs of the
present with those of the future. We will encourage enhanced recovery of oil
from the North Sea and avoid becoming too dependent in on imported fuel.
We will meet our international obligations to reduce harmful chimney
emissions.

We will restore public control of the National Grid and give it new duties
and powers to ensure the long-term security of electricity supplies. We will
secure the long-term future of the coal industry by reducing imports,
stopping the 'dash for gas' and reining back on open-casting. We will retain
the Department of Energy and move its petroleum engineering directorate to
Aberdeen. We will require the energy companies to invest in R & D, and
encourage the development of clean-burn coal technology.

We will invest in people at work
The key to a successful modern economy is a well-educated and motivated
workforce. We cannot compete on the basis of low educational standards or

poor working conditions. Britain's future must be high skill, high wage and

http://labourmanifesto.com/1992/1992-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 17

1992 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

high tech.

Two things are needed: a training revolution to modernise people's skills,
and rights for employees to fair treatment at work.

We will offer unemployed people a range of employment and training
opportunities. Our aim is to ensure that anyone who is unemployed for more
than six months has a choice of job experience or training. We will also help
the people often left out of good training opportunities, including the
disabled, women returning after caring for children, and those with special
educational needs.

Expanded childcare will help women return to work and undertake training.
A critical task is to upgrade the skills of people in work. Training and
Enterprise Councils will be retained, reformed and made more broadly
representative of their local communities and given stable budgets.

Instead of the present series of piecemeal initiatives we will establish a
coherent national training policy to meet the needs of industry and provide
people with real equal opportunities at work. All employers, except for very
small businesses, will be obliged to invest a minimum amount on training
their workforce or make a contribution to the local or national training effort.
Training will be a real partnership between government and industry, not an
excuse to shift all the burden onto employers.

We will transform the Careers Service to make careers advice available to
everyone, young or old, employed or unemployed.

Britain cannot get the best performance from our employees by giving them
the worst treatment. There will be a fair framework of law for both
employers and unions. There will be no return to the trade union legislation
of the 1970s. Ballots before strikes and for union elections will stay. There
will be no mass or flying pickets. But our individual employees are entitled
to be treated at least as fairly as their colleagues in Europe.

We will opt in to the Social Chapter of the new European Treaty and
introduce employment standards common in successful economies,
including the best health and safety legislation. The existing protection
provided for people engaged in especially hazardous work will be retained.

Women and men must be able to care for their family as well as earn a
living. We will give all employees equal rights and status under the law,
whether they are full-time or part-time, permanent or temporary. We aim to
guarantee every woman in employment the right to 14 weeks' maternity
leave on full pay, and to give fathers paternity leave, bringing Britain into
line with the better provision elsewhere in the European Community.

Employees will have new rights to be consulted and informed about
decisions which affect them, as well as the right to union membership and
representation. We will restore union rights at GCHQ. Anti-discrimination
law will be strengthened and we will consider as part of that law outlawing

http://labourmanifesto.com/1992/1992-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 17

1992 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

discrimination in employment on the grounds of age.

Britain's Wages Councils set minimum wages for about 2.5 million people.
But there is no minimum wage for all employees. We will end the scandal of
poverty pay and bring Britain into line with the rest of Europe by
introducing a statutory minimum wage of £3.40 an hour. This is a major but
long overdue reform which will benefit around four million low-paid people,
80 per cent of whom are women. We will consult widely to ensure smooth
implementation.

We will promote a stake for employees

Employees should have the opportunity to own collectively a significant
stake in the company for which they work, through a democratic Employee
Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) or a co-operative. We will strengthen support
for such schemes and consult about the possibility of creating a new tax
incentive to encourage companies to establish or extend an ESOP or set up a
co-operative.

Recent pension fund scandals have shown how right Labour has been to call
for stronger legal protection. We will reform the law so that pension funds
belong to their members, not to employers. Half of the pension trustees will
be employees, with an independent chairman, and pensioners will be
represented.

Modernising the National Health Service

This election will decide the future of the NHS. Indeed, it will decide whether
or not we continue to have a NHS of the kind that the British people want.
The Conservatives would continue to commercialise and privatise the NHS
until it is run as just another business. With Labour, it will be modernised
and restored as a high-quality public service, accountable to the community.

Labour will stop the privatisation of the NHS and return opted-out hospitals
and other services to the local NHS. We will halt the commercial market
which is creating a two-tier health service.

Our commitment to the NHS

For a decade, the Conservatives have persistently underfunded the health
service. It may well take at least the lifetime of a Parliament to put things
right, but Labour will start immediately. Instead of cutting income tax, we
will make additional resources of at least £1 billion available for investment
in the NHS over the next 22 months. Each year thereafter, we will continue
to tackle underfunding. Unlike the Conservatives, we ill not impose any new
health charges.

Labour will recognise the additional claims on the NHS from the growing

number of very elderly people and the development of medical technology
and knowledge. We will retain the pay review bodies. We will not cheat

http://labourmanifesto.com/1992/1992-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 12 of 17

1992 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

health authorities by agreeing pay awards which are not fully funded and
leaving managers to bridge the gap by cutting patient care. We will invest in
the modernisation of our hospitals and tackle the backlog of repairs and
maintenance.

We will also launch a new programme to invest £60 million in the
modernisation of Britain's cancer services, using the resources we will save
by scrapping the Conservatives' tax handout on private medical insurance.
Within our overall budget, we will tackle the shortage of intensive care beds
with a special programme providing an additional £25 million to expand this
life-saving service.

A healthy Britain

Labour will launch a National Health Initiative to promote physical and
mental health from birth to old age. This initiative will be led by the
Department of Health and Community Care and by a new Cabinet
committee that will cut through departmental boundaries.

We will set new targets to cut the inequalities in health between social
classes and ethnic groups. Our Health Initiative will set targets for better
health, backed by effective action. We will, for instance:

¢ strengthen screening by restoring the free eye test;

¢ cut cancer by banning tobacco advertising;

¢ encourage healthy diets by introducing clearer food labeling;

¢ promote health at work by creating a modern occupational health
service within the NHS.

GPs have a vital role to play in health promotion. We will increase the time
they have for each patient by reversing the financial pressures to take on too
many patients. We will make sure every community has access to dentists,
with the resources to provide full NHS cover we will and restore the free
dental check.

By improving family planning services, we will reduce unwanted
pregnancies and help achieve our target of cutting the number of abortions
by at least a quarter. We will ensure that access to abortion is equally
available in every region.

A modern NHS

We will create a modern, efficient NHS with incentives to improve
performance - but without the queue-jumping and waste created by a market
in health care.

We will provide more services through local health centres and other
community settings. We will give GPs the power to insist on improvements

in service to all the patients in a neighbourhood.

We will give the outcome of treatment the same importance as the

http://labourmanifesto.com/1992/1992-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 13 of 17

1992 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

throughput of treatment. Our new Health Quality Commission will monitor
the quality of care and raise standards.

The continuing care of very elderly and chronically sick patients will be a
higher priority. We will halt the reduction in NHS services for long-term care
and community health services which support elderly and disabled patients
at home.

To achieve this change of direction, we will negotiate Performance
Agreements with each health authority and back them with an Incentive
Fund to reward authorities which perform well. These agreements will set
local targets which reflect local priorities, for instance, to cut waiting lists or
switch mental health services into the community. Hospital to managers,
who will be accountable for meeting their targets, will otherwise be given
maximum freedom of decision making.

We will create new community health authorities, representative of local
people, which bring together both GP services and hospital care.

A first-class service to patients

In Labour's health service, power will belong to patients, not accountants.
We will restore the right of patients to be treated in the hospital of their
choice. Women will have the right to be seen by a woman GP and we will
encourage the development of well women clinics. Ethnic minorities will
have the right to obtain the diet required by their religious beliefs.

We will set four new standards for a better service to:

* cut cancelled operations;

¢ improve cleanliness in hospitals;

¢ make it easier to phone for an ambulance;

* increase early admissions from waiting lists.

As part of our commitment to a quality service to patients, we will end
compulsory competitive tendering for hospital support services, which has
driven down standards of cleanliness and catering.

We will invest £25 million from within our overall budget to purchase
several hundred more new, fully-equipped ambulances.

A community service

Labour will expand the services which elderly people and their carers need
for long-term support in the community, such as home helps, care assistants
and community services. Our Department of Health and Community Care,
with anew Minister of State for Community Care, will develop a high-
quality programme of community care which responds to what users want.

We will introduce a new earmarked grant for community care which will
support the work of Labour councils in providing care for people at home,

http://labourmanifesto.com/1992/1992-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 14 of 17

1992 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

and oblige Conservative councils to use the grant to improve those services.
We will end the pressure on councils to privatise their residential homes by
providing funding for local authorities equivalent to the benefits paid to
private homes.

We will insist that the first call on income from the sale of mental health
hospitals is the provision of better accommodation and services in the
community for mental health users and people with learning disabilities. We
will end the neglect that has allowed some former patients to end up sleeping
rough and led to others being placed on remand. Labour will ensure that
these services are in place before patients who will benefit from life in the
community are transferred out of long-term hospital care.

Raising standards in our schools

Good education is the best investment in Britain's future. All girls and boys,
from every background, must be able to discover their talents and fulfil their
potential.

We want every child to get qualifications that count. We need safe,
disciplined schools, where professional teachers work closely with parents.
Learning must become a lifetime opportunity, with new chances to update
skills at work.

That is our vision of a well-educated Britain.

But, under the Conservatives, Britain today invests a smaller share of our
national wealth in education than in 1979. More and more parents are now
being forced to pay for essentials in a system which should be free.

Labour will modernise Britain's schools. Over the next 22 months, additional
resources of at least £600 million will be made available for investment in
education. We will then continue steadily to increase the share of Britain's
national wealth invested in education.

We will offer nursery education to three and four year olds

By the end of the decade, all three and four year olds will have the
opportunity of nursery education if their parents so wish.

Within six months, every local education authority will have to set targets
for steadily increasing nursery and childcare services. Childhood
Partnerships between councils, parents, schools, local businesses and
community groups will help extend a wide range of childcare and nursery
education services.

The immediate investment in childcare described earlier (see page 10) is
only the beginning. Our Ministry for Women will have central role in
helping to develop a nationwide childcare strategy, including out-of-school
and holiday provision as well as care for younger children.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1992/1992-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 15 of 17

1992 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:27

We will raise standards in our schools

By investing in better teaching, smaller classes and modern books and
equipment we will raise education standards.

Teachers will be guaranteed a proper salary and career structure. A General
Teaching Council for England and Wales will help them achieve the highest
professional standards. Higher quality training will be followed by proper
support for newly-qualified teachers. A national in-service training
programme will ensure that all teachers are fully qualified in the subject they
are teaching.

Within 12 months, we will end the scandal of primary school classes of over
40 children. We will then establish and steadily reduce maximum limits on
class sizes, until no primary school child is taught in a class of more than 30.

To make sure that children are reading by the age of seven, we will create a
national Reading Standards Programme, with a national Reading Recovery
Programme to help those in difficult. £20 million will be invested in reading
recovery in the first year. National tests must provide the information needed
to help pupils, and to judge schools' effectiveness, without wasting good
teaching time. Children with special needs or special abilities will receive
the extra attention they deserve.

Nine out of ten secondary school children are in comprehensive schools. We
will end selection at 11 where it still exists. We will introduce a fairer system
for all school reorganisations, with independent public enquiries. We will
phase out the Assisted Places scheme (without affecting pupils currently on
a place, or offered one from September 1992) and redirect the savings to
meet wider educational needs.

Because the national curriculum cannot be properly taught without new
textbooks, we will earmark funds for class and library books. Every child
needs a good grounding in science and technology. We will introduce a
programme to improve equipment and laboratories. We will start to tackle
the backlog of school repairs. For instance, we will invest £30 million to
ensure that within 12 months, no child has to use an outside lavatory.

Guaranteed standards

Conservative plans to privatise the schools' inspectorate will be scrapped
Our Education Standards Commission, together with her Majesty's
Inspectors, will monitor the performance of every school. If a school is
under-performing, the commission, which will be answerable to Parliament,
will have the powers to ensure that it is brought up to standard.

National Awards, similar to the Queen's Award for Industry, will encourage
excellence in schools.

We will reform the Conservatives' scheme for the local management of
schools All schools will be free to manage their day-to-day budgets, with

http://labourmanifesto.com/1992/1992-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 17

local education authorities given a new strategic role. Opted-out schools will
be freed from central government control and brought together with City
Technology Colleges into the mainstream of the local school system.

new Labour because Britain
deserves better

Britain will be better with new Labour

‘Our case is simple: that Britain can and must be better'

'The vision is one of national renewal, a country with drive, purpose and
energy'

'In each area of policy a new and distinctive approach has been mapped out,
one that differs from the old left and the Conservative right. This is why new
Labour is new'

‘New Labour is a party of ideas and ideals but not of outdated ideology.
What counts is what works. The objectives are radical. The means will be
modern’

' This is our contract with the people'

I believe in Britain. It is a great country with a great history. The British
people are a great people. But I believe Britain can and must be better: better
schools, better hospitals, better ways of tackling crime, of building a modern
welfare state, of equipping ourselves for a new world economy.

I want a Britain that is one nation, with shared values and purpose, where
merit comes before privilege, run for the many not the few, strong and sure
of itself at home and abroad.

I want a Britain that does not shuffle into the new millennium afraid of the
future, but strides into it with confidence.

I want to renew our country's faith in the ability of its government and
politics to deliver this new Britain. I want to do it by making a limited set of
important promises and achieving them. This is the purpose of the bond of
trust I set out at the end of this introduction, in which ten specific
commitments are put before you. Hold us to them. They are our covenant
with you.

I want to renew faith in politics by being honest about the last 18 years.
Some things the Conservatives got right. We will not change them. It is
where they got things wrong that we will make change. We have no
intention or desire to replace one set of dogmas by another.

I want to renew faith in politics through a government that will govern in the

interest of the many, the broad majority of people who work hard, play by
the rules, pay their dues and feel let down by a political system that gives the
breaks to the few, to an elite at the top increasingly out of touch with the rest
of us.

And I want, above all, to govern in a way that brings our country together,
that unites our nation in facing the tough and dangerous challenges of the
new economy and changed society in which we must live. I want a Britain
which we all feel part of, in whose future we all have a stake, in which what
I want for my own children I want for yours.

A new politics

The reason for having created new Labour is to meet the challenges of a
different world. The millennium symbolises a new era opening up for
Britain. I am confident about our future prosperity, even optimistic, if we
have the courage to change and use it to build a better Britain.

To accomplish this means more than just a change of government. Our aim
is no less than to set British political life on a new course for the future.

People are cynical about politics and distrustful of political promises. That is
hardly surprising. There have been few more gross breaches of faith than
when the Conservatives under Mr Major promised, before the election of
1992, that they would not raise taxes, but would cut them every year; and
then went on to raise them by the largest amount in peacetime history
starting in the first Budget after the election. The Exchange Rate Mechanism
as the cornerstone of economic policy, Europe, health, crime, schools, sleaze
- the broken promises are strewn across the country's memory.

The Conservatives' broken promises taint all politics. That is why we have
made it our guiding rule not to promise what we cannot deliver; and to
deliver what we promise. What follows is not the politics of a 100 days that
dazzles for a time, then fizzles out. It is not the politics of a revolution, but of
a fresh start, the patient rebuilding and renewing of this country - renewal
that can take root and build over time.

That is one way in which politics in Britain will gain a new lease of life. But
there is another. We aim to put behind us the bitter political struggles of left
and right that have torn our country apart for too many decades. Many of
these conflicts have no relevance whatsoever to the modern world - public
versus private, bosses versus workers, middle class versus working class. It
is time for this country to move on and move forward. We are proud of our
history, proud of what we have achieved - but we must learn from our
history, not be chained to it.

New Labour

The purpose of new Labour is to give Britain a different political choice: the
choice between a failed Conservative government, exhausted and divided in

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

everything other than its desire to cling on to power, and a new and
revitalised Labour Party that has been resolute in transforming itself into a
party of the future. We have rewritten our constitution, the new Clause IV, to
put a commitment to enterprise alongside the commitment to justice. We
have changed the way we make policy, and put our relations with the trade
unions on a modern footing where they accept they can get fairness but no
favours from a Labour government. Our MPs are all now selected by
ordinary party members, not small committees or pressure groups. The
membership itself has doubled, to over 400,000, with half the members
having joined since the last election.

We submitted our draft manifesto, new Labour new life for Britain, to a
ballot of all our members, 95 per cent of whom gave it their express
endorsement.

We are a national party, supported today by people from all walks of life,
from the successful businessman or woman to the pensioner on a council
estate. Young people have flooded in to join us in what is the fastest growing
youth section of any political party in the western world.

The vision

We are a broad-based movement for progress and justice. New Labour is the
political arm of none other than the British people as a whole. Our values are
the same: the equal worth of all, with no one cast aside; fairness and justice
within strong communities.

But we have liberated these values from outdated dogma or doctrine, and we
have applied these values to the modern world.

I want a country in which people get on, do well, make a success of their
lives. I have no time for the politics of envy. We need more successful
entrepreneurs, not fewer of them. But these life-chances should be for all the
people. And I want a society in which ambition and compassion are seen as
partners not opposites - where we value public service as well as material
wealth.

New Labour believes in a society where we do not simply pursue our own
individual aims but where we hold many aims in common and work together
to achieve them. How we build the industry and employment opportunities
of the future; how we tackle the division and inequality in our society; how
we care for and enhance our environment and quality of life; how we
develop modern education and health services; how we create communities
that are safe, where mutual respect and tolerance are the order of the day.
These are things we must achieve together as a country.

The vision is one of national renewal, a country with drive, purpose and
energy. A Britain equipped to prosper in a global economy of technological
change; with a modern welfare state; its politics more accountable; and
confident of its place in the world.

Programme: a new centre and centre-left politics

In each area of policy a new and distinctive approach has been mapped out,
one that differs both from the solutions of the old left and those of the
Conservative right. This is why new Labour is new. We believe in the
strength of our values, but we recognise also that the policies of 1997 cannot
be those of 1947 or 1967. More detailed policy has been produced by us than
by any opposition in history. Our direction and destination are clear.

The old left would have sought state control of industry. The Conservative
right is content to leave all to the market. We reject both approaches.
Government and industry must work together to achieve key objectives
aimed at enhancing the dynamism of the market, not undermining it.

In industrial relations, we make it clear that there will be no return to flying
pickets, secondary action, strikes with no ballots or the trade union law of
the 1970s. There will instead be basic minimum rights for the individual at
the workplace, where our aim is partnership not conflict between employers
and employees.

In economic management, we accept the global economy as a reality and
reject the isolationism and 'go-it-alone' policies of the extremes of right or
left.

In education, we reject both the idea of a return to the 11-plus and the
monolithic comprehensive schools that take no account of children's
differing abilities. Instead we favour all-in schooling which identifies the
distinct abilities of individual pupils and organises them in classes to
maximise their progress in individual subjects. In this way we modernise the
comprehensive principle, learning from the experience of its 30 years of
application.

In health policy, we will safeguard the basic principles of the NHS, which
we founded, but will not return to the top-down management of the 1970s.
So we will keep the planning and provision of healthcare separate, but put
planning on a longer-term, decentralised and more co-operative basis. The
key is to root out unnecessary administrative cost, and to spend money on
the right things - frontline care.

On crime, we believe in personal responsibility and in punishing crime, but
also tackling its underlying causes - so, tough on crime, tough on the causes
of crime, different from the Labour approach of the past and the Tory policy
of today.

Over-centralisation of government and lack of accountability was a problem
in governments of both left and right. Labour is committed to the democratic
renewal of our country through decentralisation and the elimination of
excessive government secrecy.

In addition, we will face up to the new issues that confront us. We will be the
party of welfare reform. In consultation and partnership with the people, we

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

will design a modern welfare state based on rights and duties going together,
fit for the modern world.

We will stand up for Britain's interests in Europe after the shambles of the
last six years, but, more than that, we will lead a campaign for reform in
Europe. Europe isn't working in the way this country and Europe need. But
to lead means to be involved, to be constructive, to be capable of getting our
own way.

We will put concern for the environment at the heart of policy-making, so
that it is not an add-on extra, but informs the whole of government, from
housing and energy policy through to global warming and international
agreements.

We will search out at every turn new ways and new ideas to tackle the new
issues: how to encourage more flexible working hours and practices to suit
employees and employers alike; how to harness the huge potential of the
new information technology; how to simplify the processes of the
government machine; how to put public and private sector together in
partnership to give us the infrastructure and transport system we need.

We will be a radical government. But the definition of radicalism will not be
that of doctrine, whether of left or right, but of achievement. New Labour is
a party of ideas and ideals but not of outdated ideology. What counts is what
works. The objectives are radical. The means will be modern.

So the party is transformed. The vision is clear. And from that vision stems a
modern programme of change and renewal for Britain. We understand that
after 18 years of one-party rule, people want change, believe that it is
necessary for the country and for democracy, but require faith to make the
change.

We therefore set out in the manifesto that follows ten commitments,
commitments that form our bond of trust with the people. They are specific.
They are real. Judge us on them. Have trust in us and we will repay that
trust.

Our mission in politics is to rebuild this bond of trust between government
and the people. That is the only way democracy can flourish. I pledge to
Britain a government which shares their hopes, which understands their
fears, and which will work as partners with and for all our people, not just
the privileged few. This is our contract with the people.

Over the five years of a Labour government:

1. Education will be our number one priority, and we will increase
the share of national income spent on education as we decrease it
on the bills of economic and social failure

2. There will be no increase in the basic or top rates of income tax

3. We will provide stable economic growth with low inflation, and
promote dynamic and competitive business and industry at home

and abroad

4. We will get 250,000 young unemployed off benefit and into work

5. We will rebuild the NHS, reducing spending on administration
and increasing spending on patient care

6. We will be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime, and
halve the time it takes persistent juvenile offenders to come to
court

7. We will help build strong families and strong communities, and
lay the foundations of a modern welfare state in pensions and
community care

8. We will safeguard our environment, and develop an integrated
transport policy to fight congestion and pollution

9. We will clean up politics, decentralise political power throughout
the United Kingdom and put the funding of political parties on a
proper and accountable basis

10. We will give Britain the leadership in Europe which Britain and

Europe need

We have modernised the Labour Party and we will modernise Britain. This
means knowing where we want to go; being clear-headed about the country's
future; telling the truth; making tough choices; insisting that all parts of the
public sector live within their means; taking on vested interests that hold
people back; standing up to unreasonable demands from any quarter; and
being prepared to give a moral lead where government has responsibilities it
should not avoid.

Britain does deserve better. And new Labour will be better for Britain.

We will make education our number one
priority

¢ Cut class sizes to 30 or under for 5,6 and 7 year-olds

¢ Nursery places for all four year-olds

e Attack low standards in schools

¢ Access to computer technology

e Lifelong learning through a new University for Industry

¢ More spending on education as the cost of unemployment falls

Education has been the Tories' biggest failure. It is Labour's number one
priority.

It is not just good for the individual. It is an economic necessity for the
nation. We will compete successfully on the basis of quality or not at all.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

And quality comes from developing the potential of all our people. It is the
people who are our greatest natural asset. We will ensure they can fulfil their
potential.

Nearly half of 11 year-olds in England and Wales fail to reach expected
standards in English and maths. Britain has a smaller share of 17 and 18
year-olds in full-time education than any major industrial nation. Nearly two
thirds of the British workforce lack vocational qualifications.

There are excellent schools in Britain's state education system. But far too
many children are denied the opportunity to succeed. Our task is to raise the
standards of every school.

We will put behind us the old arguments that have bedevilled education in
this country. We reject the Tories' obsession with school structures: all
parents should be offered real choice through good quality schools, each
with its own strengths and individual ethos. There should be no return to the
11-plus. It divides children into successes and failures at far too early an age.

We must modernise comprehensive schools. Children are not all of the same
ability, nor do they learn at the same speed. That means 'setting' children in
classes to maximise progress, for the benefit of high-fliers and slower
learners alike. The focus must be on levelling up, not levelling down.

With Labour, the Department for Education and Employment will become a
leading office of state. It will give a strong and consistent lead to help raise
standards in every school. Standards, more than structures, are the key to
success. Labour will never put dogma before children's education. Our
approach will be to intervene where there are problems, not where schools
are succeeding.

Labour will never force the abolition of good schools whether in the private
or state sector. Any changes in the admissions policies of grammar schools
will be decided by local parents. Church schools will retain their distinctive
religious ethos.

We wish to build bridges wherever we can across education divides. The
educational apartheid created by the public/private divide diminishes the
whole education system.

Zero tolerance of underperformance

Every school has the capacity to succeed. All Local Education Authorities
(LEAs) must demonstrate that every school is improving. For those failing
schools unable to improve, ministers will order a 'fresh start' - close the
school and start afresh on the same site. Where good schools and bad
schools coexist side by side we will authorise LEAs to allow one school to
take over the other to set the underperforming school on a new path.

Quality nursery education guaranteed for all four year-olds

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 7 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

Nursery vouchers have been proven not to work. They are costly and do not
generate more quality nursery places. We will use the money saved by
scrapping nursery vouchers to guarantee places for four year-olds. We will
invite selected local authorities to pilot early excellence centres combining
education and care for the under-fives. We will set targets for universal
provision for three year-olds whose parents want it.

New focus on standards in primary schools

Primary schools are the key to mastering the basics and developing in every
child an eagerness to learn.

Every school needs baseline assessment of pupils when they enter the
school, and a year-on-year target for improvement.

We will reduce class sizes for five, six and seven year-olds to 30 or under, by
phasing out the assisted places scheme, the cost of which is set to rise to
£180 million per year.

We must recognise the three 'r's for what they are - building blocks of all
learning that must be taught better. We will achieve this by improving the
skills of the teaching force; ensuring a stronger focus on literacy in the
curriculum; and piloting literacy summer schools to meet our new target that
within a decade every child leaves primary school with a reading age of at
least 11 (barely half do today).

Our numeracy taskforce will develop equally ambitious targets. We will
encourage the use of the most effective teaching methods, including phonics
for reading and whole class interactive teaching for maths.

Attacking educational disadvantage

No matter where a school is, Labour will not tolerate under-achievement.
Public/private partnerships will improve the condition of school buildings.

There will be education action zones to attack low standards by recruiting
the best teachers and head teachers to under-achieving schools; by
supporting voluntary mentoring schemes to provide one-to-one support for
disadvantaged pupils; and by creating new opportunities for children, after
the age of 14, to enhance their studies by acquiring knowledge and
experience within industry and commerce.

To attack under-achievement in urban areas, we have developed a new
scheme with the Premier League. In partnerships between central
government, local government and football clubs, study support centres will
be set up at Premier League grounds for the benefit of local children. The
scheme will be launched on a pilot basis during the 1997/8 season.

We support the greatest possible integration into mainstream education of
pupils with special educational needs, while recognising that specialist

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 8 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28
facilities are essential to meet particular needs.
Realising the potential of new technology

Labour is the pioneer of new thinking. We have agreed with British Telecom
and the cable companies that they will wire up schools, libraries, colleges
and hospitals to the information superhighway free of charge. We have also
secured agreement to make access charges as low as possible.

For the Internet we plan a National Grid for Learning, franchised as a
public/private partnership, which will bring to teachers up-to-date materials
to enhance their skills, and to children high-quality educational materials.
We will use lottery money to improve the skills of existing teachers in
information technology.

In opposition, Labour set up the independent Stevenson Commission to
promote access for children to new technology. Its recent report is a
challenging programme for the future. We are urgently examining how to
implement its plans, in particular the development of educational software
through a grading system which will provide schools with guarantees of
product quality; and the provision for every child of an individual email
address. An independent standing committee will continue to advise us on
the implementation of our plans in government.

The role of parents
We will increase the powers and responsibilities of parents.

There will be more parent governors and, for the first time, parent
representatives on LEAs.

A major objective is to promote a culture of responsibility for learning
within the family, through contracts between all schools and parents,
defining the responsibilities of each. National guidelines will establish
minimum periods for homework for primary and secondary school pupils.

Teachers will be entitled to positive support from parents to promote good
attendance and sound discipline. Schools suffer from unruly and disruptive
pupils. Exclusion or suspension may sometimes be necessary. We will,
however, pilot new pupil referral units so that schools are protected but these
pupils are not lost to education or the country.

New job description for LEAs

The judge and jury of LEA performance will be their contribution to raising
standards.

LEAs are closer to schools than central government, and have the authority
of being locally elected. But they will be required to devolve power, and
more of their budgets, to heads and governors. LEA performance will be
inspected by Ofsted and the Audit Commission. Where authorities are
deemed to be failing, the secretary of state may suspend the relevant powers

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28
of the LEA and send in an improvement team.
Grant maintained schools

Schools that are now grant maintained will prosper with Labour's proposals,
as will every school.

Tory claims that Labour will close these schools are false. The system of
funding will not discriminate unfairly either between schools or between
pupils. LEAs will be represented on governing bodies, but will not control
them. We support guidelines for open and fair admissions, along the lines of
those introduced in 1993; but we will also provide a right of appeal to an
independent panel in disputed cases.

Teachers: pressure and support

Schools are critically dependent on the quality of all staff. The majority of
teachers are skilful and dedicated, but some fall short. We will improve
teacher training, and ensure that all teachers have an induction year when
they first qualify, to ensure their suitability for teaching.

There will be a general teaching council to speak for and raise standards in
the profession. We will create a new grade of teachers to recognise the best.
There will, however, be speedy, but fair, procedures to remove teachers who
cannot do the job.

The strength of a school is critically dependent on the quality of its head. We
will establish mandatory qualifications for the post. A head teacher will be
appointed to a position only when fully trained to accept the responsibility.

Higher education

The improvement and expansion needed cannot be funded out of general
taxation. Our proposals for funding have been made to the Dearing
Committee, in line with successful policies abroad.

The costs of student maintenance should be repaid by graduates on an
income-related basis, from the career success to which higher education has
contributed. The current system is badly administered and payback periods
are too short. We will provide efficient administration, with fairness ensured
by longer payback periods where required.

Lifelong learning

We must learn throughout life, to retain employment through new and
improved skills. We will promote adult learning both at work and in the
critical sector of further education.

In schools and colleges, we support broader A-levels and upgraded
vocational qualifications, underpinned by rigorous standards and key skills.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

Employers have the primary responsibility for training their workforces in
job-related skills. But individuals should be given the power to invest in
training. We will invest public money for training in Individual Learning
Accounts which individuals - for example women returning to the labour
force - can then use to gain the skills they want. We will kickstart the
programme for up to a million people, using £150 million of TEC money
which could be better used and which would provide a contribution of £150,
alongside individuals making small investments of their own. Employers
will be encouraged to make voluntary contributions to these funds. We will
also promote the extension of the Investors in People initiative into many
more small firms.

Our new University for Industry, collaborating with the Open University,
will bring new opportunities to adults seeking to develop their potential.
This will bring government, industry and education together to create a new
resource whose remit will be to use new technology to enhance skills and
education. The University for Industry will be a public/private partnership,
commissioning software and developing the links to extend lifelong
learning.

Government spending on education

The Conservatives have cut government spending on education as a share of
national income by the equivalent of more than £3 billion as spending on the
bills of economic and social failure has risen. We are committed to reversing
this trend of spending. Over the course of a five-year Parliament, as we cut
the costs of economic and social failure we will raise the proportion of
national income spent on education.

We will promote personal prosperity for all

¢ Economic stability to promote investment

¢ Tough inflation target, mortgage rates as low as possible

¢ Stick for two years within existing spending limits

¢ Five-year pledge: no increase in income tax rates

¢ Long-term objective of ten pence starting rate of income tax
¢ Early Budget to get people off welfare and into work

The Conservatives have in 18 years created the two longest, deepest
recessions this century.

We have experienced the slowest average growth rate of any similar period
since the second world war. There has been a fundamental failure to tackle
the underlying causes of inflation, of low growth and of unemployment.
These are:

¢ too much economic instability, with wild swings from boom to bust

¢ too little investment in education and skills, and in the application of
new technologies

¢ too few opportunities to find jobs, start new businesses or become

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 11 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

self-employed
¢ too narrow an industrial base and too little sense of common purpose
in the workplace or across the nation.

Britain can do better. We must build on the British qualities of inventiveness,

creativity and adaptability. New Labour's objective is to improve living
standards for the many, not just the few. Business can and must succeed in
raising productivity. This requires a combination of a skilled and educated
workforce with investment in the latest technological innovations, as the
route to higher wages and employment.

An explicit objective of a Labour government will be to raise the trend rate
of growth by strengthening our wealth-creating base. We will nurture
investment in industry, skills, infrastructure and new technologies. And we
will attack long-term unemployment, especially among young people. Our
goal will be educational and employment opportunities for all.

Economic stability is the essential platform for sustained growth. In a global
economy the route to growth is stability not inflation. The priority must be
stable, low-inflation conditions for long-term growth. The root causes of
inflation and low growth are the same - an economic and industrial base that
remains weak. Government cannot solve all economic problems or end the
economic cycle. But by spending wisely and taxing fairly, government can
help tackle the problems. Our goals are low inflation, rising living standards
and high and stable levels of employment.

Spending and tax: new Labour's approach

The myth that the solution to every problem is increased spending has been
comprehensively dispelled under the Conservatives. Spending has risen. But
more spending has brought neither greater fairness nor less poverty. Quite
the reverse - our society is more divided than it has been for generations.
The level of public spending is no longer the best measure of the
effectiveness of government action in the public interest. It is what money is
actually spent on that counts more than how much money is spent.

The national debt has doubled under John Major. The public finances remain
weak. A new Labour government will give immediate high priority to seeing
how public money can be better used.

New Labour will be wise spenders, not big spenders. We will work in
partnership with the private sector to achieve our goals. We will ask about
public spending the first question that a manager in any company would ask
- can existing resources be used more effectively to meet our priorities? And
because efficiency and value for money are central, ministers will be
required to save before they spend.

Save to invest is our approach, not tax and spend.

The increase in taxes under the Conservatives is the most dramatic evidence
of economic failure. Since 1992 the typical family has paid more than

13/06/2024, 13:28

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

£2,000 in extra taxes - the biggest tax hike in peacetime history, breaking
every promise made by John Major at the last election. The tragedy is that
those hardest hit are least able to pay. That is why we strongly opposed the
imposition of VAT on fuel: it was Labour that stopped the government from
increasing VAT on fuel to 17.5 per cent.

Taxation is not neutral in the way it raises revenue. How and what
governments tax sends clear signals about the economic activities they
believe should be encouraged or discouraged, and the values they wish to
entrench in society. Just as, for example, work should be encouraged through
the tax system, environmental pollution should be discouraged.

New Labour will establish a new trust on tax with the British people. The
promises we make we will keep. The principles that will underpin our tax
policy are clear:

* to encourage employment opportunities and work incentives for all
* to promote savings and investment
¢ and to be fair and be seen to be fair.

New Labour is not about high taxes on ordinary families. It is about social
justice and a fair deal.

New Labour therefore makes the following economic pledges.
Fair taxes

There will be no return to the penal tax rates that existed under both Labour
and Conservative governments in the 1970s.

To encourage work and reward effort, we are pledged not to raise the basic
or top rates of income tax throughout the next Parliament.

Our long-term objective is a lower starting rate of income tax of ten pence in
the pound. Reducing the high marginal rates at the bottom end of the earning
scale - often 70 or 80 per cent - is not only fair but desirable to encourage
employment.

This goal will benefit the many, not the few. It is in sharp contrast to the Tory
goal of abolishing capital gains and inheritance tax, at least half the benefit
of which will go to the richest 5,000 families in the country.

We will cut VAT on fuel to five per cent, the lowest level allowed.

We renew our pledge not to extend VAT to food, children's clothes, books
and newspapers and public transport fares.

We will also examine the interaction of the tax and benefits systems so that
they can be streamlined and modernised, so as to fulfil our objectives of
promoting work incentives, reducing poverty and welfare dependency, and
strengthening community and family life.

No risks with inflation

We will match the current target for low and stable inflation of 2. 5 per cent
or less. We will reform the Bank of England to ensure that decision-making
on monetary policy is more effective, open, accountable and free from short-
term political manipulation.

Strict rules for government borrowing

We will enforce the 'golden rule' of public spending - over the economic
cycle, we will only borrow to invest and not to fund current expenditure.

We will ensure that - over the economic cycle - public debt as a proportion
of national income is at a stable and prudent level.

Stick to planned public spending allocations for the first two
years of office

Our decisions have not been taken lightly. They are a recognition of
Conservative mismanagement of the public finances. For the next two years
Labour will work within the departmental ceilings for spending already
announced. We will resist unreasonable demands on the public purse,
including any unreasonable public sector pay demands.

Switch spending from economic failure to investment

We will conduct a central spending review and departmental reviews to
assess how to use resources better, while rooting out waste and inefficiency
in public spending.

Labour priorities in public spending are different from Tory priorities.
Tax reform to promote saving and investment

We will introduce a new individual savings account and extend the principle
of TESSAs and PEPs to promote long-term saving. We will review the
corporate and capital gains tax regimes to see how the tax system can
promote greater long-term investment.

Labour's welfare-to-work Budget

We will introduce a Budget within two months after the election to begin the
task of equipping the British economy and reforming the welfare state to get
young people and the long-term unemployed back to work. This welfare-to-
work programme will be funded by a windfall levy on the excess profits of
the privatised utilities, introduced in this Budget after we have consulted the
regulators.

Backing business: skills, infrastructure, new markets

Gains for consumers with tough competition law

New measures to help small businesses

National minimum wage to tackle low pay

Boost local economic growth with Regional Development Agencies
A strong and effective voice in Europe

/UL>

Labour offers business a new deal for the future. We will leave intact
the main changes of the 1980s in industrial relations and enterprise.
We see healthy profits as an essential motor of a dynamic market
economy, and believe they depend on quality products, innovative
entrepreneurs and skilled employees. We will build a new partnership
with business to improve the competitiveness of British industry for
the 21st century, leading to faster growth.

Many of the fundamentals of the British economy are still weak. Low
pay and low skills go together: insecurity is the consequence of
economic instability; the absence of quality jobs is a product of the
weakness of our industrial base; we suffer from both high
unemployment and skills shortages. There is no future for Britain as a
low wage economy: we cannot compete on wages with countries
paying a tenth or a hundredth of British wages.

We need to win on higher quality, skill, innovation and reliability.
With Labour, British and inward investors will find this country an
attractive and profitable place to do business.

New Labour believes in a flexible labour market that serves employers
and employees alike. But flexibility alone is not enough. We need
‘flexibility plus':

© plus higher skills and higher standards in our schools and
colleges

© plus policies to ensure economic stability

© plus partnership with business to raise investment in
infrastructure, science and research and to back small firms

© plus new leadership from Britain to reform Europe, in place of
the current policy of drift and disengagement from our largest
market

© plus guaranteeing Britain's membership of the single market -
indeed opening up further markets inside and outside the EU -
helping make Britain an attractive place to do business

© plus minimum standards of fair treatment, including a national
minimum wage

© plus an imaginative welfare-to-work programme to put the long-
term unemployed back to work and to cut social security costs.

A reformed and tougher competition law

Competitiveness abroad must begin with competition at
home. Effective competition can bring value and quality
to consumers. As an early priority we will reform
Britain's competition law. We will adopt a tough
‘prohibitive’ approach to deter anti-competitive practices
and abuses of market power.

In the utility industries we will promote competition
wherever possible. Where competition is not an effective
discipline, for example in the water industry which has a
poor environmental record and has in most cases been a
tax-free zone, we will pursue tough, efficient regulation in
the interests of customers, and, in the case of water, in the
interests of the environment as well. We recognise the
need for open and predictable regulation which is fair
both to consumers and to shareholders and at the same
time provides incentives for managers to innovate and
improve efficiency.

Reinvigorate the Private Finance Initiative

Britain's infrastructure is dangerously run down: parts of
our road and rail network are seriously neglected, and all
too often our urban environment has been allowed to
deteriorate.

Labour pioneered the idea of public/private partnerships.
It is Labour local authorities which have done most to
create these partnerships at local level.

A Labour government will overcome the problems that
have plagued the PFI at a national level. We will set
priorities between projects, saving time and expense; we
will seek a realistic allocation of risk between the partners
to a project; and we will ensure that best practice is spread
throughout government. We will aim to simplify and
speed up the planning process for major infrastructure
projects of vital national interest.

We will ensure that self-financing commercial
organisations within the public sector - the Post Office is a

prime example - are given greater commercial freedom to
make the most of new opportunities.

Backing small business

The number of small employers has declined by half a
million since 1990. Support for small businesses will have

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

a major role in our plans for economic growth. We will
cut unnecessary red tape; provide for statutory interest on
late payment of debts; improve support for high-tech
start-ups; improve the quality and relevance of advice and
training through a reformed Business Links network and
the University for Industry; and assist firms to enter
overseas markets more effectively.

Local economic growth

Prosperity needs to be built from the bottom up. We will
establish one-stop regional development agencies to co-
ordinate regional economic development, help small
business and encourage inward investment. Many regions
are already taking informal steps to this end and they will
be supported.

Strengthen our capability in science,
technology and design

The UK must be positively committed to the global
pursuit of new knowledge, with a strong science base in
our universities and centres of excellence leading the
world. The Dearing Committee represents a significant
opportunity to promote high-quality standards in science
teaching and research throughout UK higher education.
We support a collaborative approach between researchers
and business, spreading the use of new technology and
good design, and exploiting our own inventions to boost
business in the UK.

Promoting new green technologies and
businesses

There is huge potential to develop Britain's environmental
technology industries to create jobs, win exports and
protect the environment.

Effective environmental management is an increasingly
important component of modern business practice. We
support a major push to promote energy conservation -
particularly by the promotion of home energy efficiency
schemes, linked to our environment taskforce for the
under-25s. We are committed to an energy policy
designed to promote cleaner, more efficient energy use
and production, including a new and strong drive to
develop renewable energy sources such as solar and wind
energy, and combined heat and power. We see no
economic case for the building of any new nuclear power

stations.

Key elements of the 1980s trade union reforms
to stay

There must be minimum standards for the individual at
work, including a minimum wage, within a flexible labour
market. We need a sensible balance in industrial relations
law - rights and duties go together.

The key elements of the trade union legislation of the
1980s will stay - on ballots, picketing and industrial
action. People should be free to join or not to join a union.
Where they do decide to join, and where a majority of the
relevant workforce vote in a ballot for the union to
represent them, the union should be recognised. This
promotes stable and orderly industrial relations. There
will be full consultation on the most effective means of
implementing this proposal.

Partnership at work

The best companies recognise their employees as partners
in the enterprise. Employees whose conditions are good
are more committed to their companies and are more
productive. Many unions and employers are embracing
partnership in place of conflict. Government should
welcome this.

We are keen to encourage a variety of forms of
partnership and enterprise, spreading ownership and
encouraging more employees to become owners through
Employee Share Ownership Plans and co-operatives. We
support too the Social Chapter of the EU, but will deploy
our influence in Europe to ensure that it develops so as to
promote employability and competitiveness, not
inflexibility.

A sensibly set national minimum wage

There should be a statutory level beneath which pay
should not fall - with the minimum wage decided not on
the basis of a rigid formula but according to the economic
circumstances of the time and with the advice of an
independent low pay commission, whose membership
will include representatives of employers, including small
business, and employees.

Every modern industrial country has a minimum wage,
including the US and Japan. Britain used to have

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 18 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

minimum wages through the Wages Councils. Introduced
sensibly, the minimum wage will remove the worst
excesses of low pay (and be of particular benefit to
women), while cutting some of the massive £4 billion
benefits bill by which the taxpayer subsidises companies
that pay very low wages.

We will get the unemployed from
welfare to work

= Stop the growth of an 'underclass' in Britain

= 250,000 young unemployed off benefit and into
work

= Tax cuts for employers who create new jobs for the
long-term unemployed

= Effective help for lone parents

There are over one million fewer jobs in Britain than in
1990. One in five families has no one working. One
million single mothers are trapped on benefits. There is a
wider gap between rich and poor than for generations.

We are determined not to continue down the road of a
permanent have-not class, unemployed and disaffected
from society. Our long-term objective is high and stable
levels of employment. This is the true meaning of a
stakeholder economy - where everyone has a stake in
society and owes responsibilities to it.

The best way to tackle poverty is to help people into jobs
- real jobs. The unemployed have a responsibility to take
up the opportunity of training places or work, but these
must be real opportunities. The government's workfare
proposals - with a success rate of one in ten - fail this test.

Labour's welfare-to-work programme will attack
unemployment and break the spiral of escalating spending
on social security. A one-off windfall levy on the excess
profits of the privatised utilities will fund our ambitious
programme.

Every young person unemployed for more
than six months in a job or training

We will give 250,000 under-25s opportunities for work,
education and training. Four options will be on offer, each
involving day-release education or training leading to a
qualification: private-sector job: employers will be offered
a 60 pound-a-week rebate for six months work with a

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 19 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

non-profit voluntary sector employer, paying a weekly
wage, equivalent to benefit plus a fixed sum for six
months full-time study for young people without
qualifications on an approved course a job with the
environment taskforce, linked to Labour's citizens' service
programme. Rights and responsibilities must go hand in
hand, without a fifth option of life on full benefit.

Every 16 and 17 year-old on the road to a
proper qualification by the year 2000

Nearly a third of young people do not achieve an NVQ
level two qualification by age 19. All young people will
be offered part-time or full-time education after the age of
16. Any under-18 year-old in a job will have the right to
study on an approved course for qualifications at college.
We will replace the failed Youth Training scheme with
our new Target 2000 programme, offering young people
high-quality education and training.

Action on long-term unemployment

New partnerships between government and business, fully
involving local authorities and the voluntary sector, will
attack long-term joblessness. We will encourage
employers to take on those who have suffered
unemployment for more than two years with a 75 pound-
a-week tax rebate paid for six months, financed by the
windfall levy. Our programme for the phased release of
past receipts from council house sales will provide new
jobs in the construction industry.

Lone parents into work

Today the main connection between unemployed lone
parents and the state is their benefits. Most lone parents
want to work, but are given no help to find it. New
Labour has a positive policy. Once the youngest child is
in the second term of full-time school, lone parents will
be offered advice by a proactive Employment Service to
develop a package of job search, training and after-school
care to help them off benefit.

Customised, personalised services

We favour initiatives with new combinations of available
benefits to suit individual circumstances. In new and
innovative 'Employment Zones’, personal job accounts

will combine money currently available for benefits and

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 20 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

training, to offer the unemployed new options - leading to
work and independence. We will co-ordinate benefits,
employment and career services, and utilise new
technology to improve their quality and efficiency.

Fraud

Just as we owe it to the taxpayer to crack down on tax
avoidance, so we must crack down on dishonesty in the
benefit system. We will start with a clampdown on
Housing Benefit fraud, estimated to cost £2 billion a year,
and will maintain action against benefit fraud of all kinds.

We will save the NHS

= 100,000 people off waiting lists

= End the Tory internal market

= End waiting for cancer surgery

= Tough quality targets for hospitals

= Independent food standards agency

= New public health drive

= Raise spending in real terms every year - and spend
the money on patients not bureaucracy

Labour created the NHS 50 years ago. It is under threat
from the Conservatives. We want to save and modernise
the NHS.

But if the Conservatives are elected again there may well
not be an NHS in five years' time - neither national nor
comprehensive. Labour commits itself anew to the
historic principle: that if you are ill or injured there will
be a national health service there to help; and access to it
will be based on need and need alone - not on your ability
to pay, or on who your GP happens to be or on where you
live.

In 1990 the Conservatives imposed on the NHS a
complex internal market of hospitals competing to win
contracts from health authorities and fundholding GPs.
The result is an NHS strangled by costly red tape, with
every individual transaction the subject of a separate
invoice. After six years, bureaucracy swallows an extra
£1.5 billion per year; there are 20,000 more managers and
50,000 fewer nurses on the wards; and more than one
million people are on waiting lists. The government has
consistently failed to meet even its own health targets.

There can be no return to top-down management, but
Labour will end the Conservatives' internal market in

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 21 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

healthcare. The planning and provision of care are
necessary and distinct functions, and will remain so. But
under the Tories, the administrative costs of purchasing
care have undermined provision and the market system
has distorted clinical priorities. Labour will cut costs by
removing the bureaucratic processes of the internal
market.

The savings achieved will go on direct care for patients.
As a Start, the first £100 million saved will treat an extra
100,000 patients. We will end waiting for cancer surgery,
thereby helping thousands of women waiting for breast
cancer treatment.

Primary care will play a lead role

In recent years, GPs have gained power on behalf of their
patients in a changed relationship with consultants, and
we support this. But the development of GP fundholding
has also brought disadvantages. Decision-making has
been fragmented. Administrative costs have grown. And a
two-tier service has resulted.

Labour will retain the lead role for primary care but
remove the disadvantages that have come from the
present system. GPs and nurses will take the lead in
combining together locally to plan local health services
more efficiently for all the patients in their area. This will
enable all GPs in an area to bring their combined strength
to bear upon individual hospitals to secure higher
standards of patient provision. In making this change, we
will build on the existing collaborative schemes which
already serve 14 million people.

The current system of year-on-year contracts is costly and
unstable. We will introduce three- to five-year agreements
between the local primary care teams and hospitals.
Hospitals will then be better able to plan work at full
capacity and co-operate to enhance patient services.

Higher-quality services for patients

Hospitals will retain their autonomy over day-to-day
administrative functions, but, as part of the NHS, they
will be required to meet high-quality standards in the
provision of care. Management will be held to account for
performance levels. Boards will become more
representative of the local communities they serve. Anew
patients' charter will concentrate on the quality and
success of treatment. The Tories' so-called 'Efficiency

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 22 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

Index' counts the number of patient 'episodes', not the
quality or success of treatment. With Labour, the measure
will be quality of outcome, itself an incentive for
effectiveness. As part of our concern to ensure quality, we
will work towards the elimination of mixed-sex wards.

Health authorities will become the guardians of high
standards. They will monitor services, spread best
practice and ensure rising standards of care.

The Tory attempt to use private money to build hospitals
has failed to deliver. Labour will overcome the problems
that have plagued the Private Finance Initiative, end the
delays, sort out the confusion and develop new forms of
public/private partnership that work better and protect the
interests of the NHS. Labour is opposed to the
privatisation of clinical services which is being actively
promoted by the Conservatives.

Labour will promote new developments in telemedicine -
bringing expert advice from regional centres of excellence
to neighbourhood level using new technology.

Good health

A new minister for public health will attack the root
causes of ill health, and so improve lives and save the
NHS money. Labour will set new goals for improving the
overall health of the nation which recognise the impact
that poverty, poor housing, unemployment and a polluted
environment have on health.

Smoking is the greatest single cause of preventable illness
and premature death in the UK. We will therefore ban
tobacco advertising.

Labour will establish an independent food standards
agency. The £3.5 billion BSE crisis and the E. coli
outbreak which resulted in serious loss of life, have made
unanswerable the case for the independent agency we
have proposed.

NHS spending

The Conservatives have wasted spending on the NHS. We
will do better. We will raise spending on the NHS in real
terms every year and put the money towards patient care.
And a greater proportion of every pound spent will go on
patient care not bureaucracy.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 23 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

An NHS for the future

The NHS requires continuity as well as change, or the
system cannot cope. There must be pilots to ensure that
change works. And there must be flexibility, not rigid
prescription, if innovation is to flourish.

Our fundamental purpose is simple but hugely important:
to restore the NHS as a public service working co-
operatively for patients, not a commercial business driven
by competition.

We will be tough on crime and
tough on the causes of crime

= Fast-track punishment for persistent young
offenders

= Reform Crown Prosecution Service to convict more
criminals

= Police on the beat not pushing paper

= Crackdown on petty crimes and neighbourhood
disorder

= Fresh parliamentary vote to ban all handguns

Under the Conservatives, crime has doubled and many
more criminals get away with their crimes: the number of
people convicted has fallen by a third, with only one
crime in 50 leading to a conviction. This is the worst
record of any government since the Second World War -
and for England and Wales the worst record of any major
industrialised country. Last year alone violent crime rose
11 per cent.

We propose a new approach to law and order: tough on
crime and tough on the causes of crime. We insist on
individual responsibility for crime, and will attack the
causes of crime by our measures to relieve social
deprivation.

The police have our strong support. They are in the front
line of the fight against crime and disorder. The
Conservatives have broken their 1992 general election
pledge to provide an extra 1,000 police officers. We will
relieve the police of unnecessary bureaucratic burdens to
get more officers back on the beat.

Youth crime
Youth crime and disorder have risen sharply, but very few

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 24 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

young offenders end up in court, and when they do half
are let off with another warning. Young offenders account
for seven million crimes a year.

Far too often young criminals offend again and again
while waiting months for a court hearing. We will halve
the time it takes to get persistent young offenders from
arrest to sentencing; replace widespread repeat cautions
with a single final warning; bring together Youth Offender
Teams in every area; and streamline the system of youth
courts to make it far more effective.

New parental responsibility orders will make parents face
up to their responsibility for their children's misbehaviour.

Conviction and sentencing

The job of the Crown Prosecution Service is to prosecute
criminals effectively. There is strong evidence that the
CPS is over-centralised, bureaucratic and inefficient, with
cases too often dropped, delayed, or downgraded to lesser
offences.

Labour will decentralise the CPS, with local crown
prosecutors co-operating more effectively with local
police forces.

We will implement an effective sentencing system for all
the main offences to ensure greater consistency and
stricter punishment for serious repeat offenders. The
courts will have to spell out what each sentence really
means in practice. The Court of Appeal will have a duty
to lay down sentencing guidelines for all the main
offences. The attorney general's power to appeal unduly
lenient sentences will be extended.

The prison service now faces serious financial problems.
We will audit the resources available, take proper
ministerial responsibility for the service, and seek to
ensure that prison regimes are constructive and require
inmates to face up to their offending behaviour.

Disorder

The Conservatives have forgotten the 'order' part of ‘law
and order'. We will tackle the unacceptable level of anti-
social behaviour and crime on our streets. Our 'zero
tolerance’ approach will ensure that petty criminality
among young offenders is seriously addressed.

Community safety orders will deal with threatening and

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 25 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

disruptive criminal neighbours. Labour has taken the lead
in proposing action to tackle the problems of stalking and
domestic violence.

Child protection orders will deal with young children
suffering neglect by parents because they are left out on
their own far too late at night.

Britain is a multiracial and multicultural society. All its
members must have the protection of the law. We will
create a new offence of racial harassment and a new crime
of racially motivated violence to protect ethnic minorities
from intimidation.

Drugs

The vicious circle of drugs and crime wrecks lives and
threatens communities. Labour will appoint an anti-drugs
supremo to co-ordinate our battle against drugs across all
government departments. The 'drug czar' will be a symbol
of our commitment to tackle the modern menace of drugs
in our communities.

We will pilot the use of compulsory drug testing and
treatment orders for offenders to ensure that the link
between drug addiction and crime is broken. This will be
paid for by bringing remand delays down to the national
targets.

We will attack the drug problem in prisons. In addition to
random drug testing of all prisoners we will aim for a
voluntary testing unit in every prison for prisoners ready
to prove they are drug-free.

Victims

Victims of crime are too often neglected by the criminal
justice system. We will ensure that victims are kept fully
informed of the progress of their case, and why charges
may have been downgraded or dropped.

Greater protection will be provided for victims in rape
and serious sexual offence trials and for those subject to
intimidation, including witnesses.

Prevention

We will place a new responsibility on local authorities to
develop statutory partnerships to help prevent crime.
Local councils will then be required to set targets for the

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 26 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28
reduction of crime and disorder in their area.
Gun control

In the wake of Dunblane and Hungerford, it is clear that
only the strictest firearms laws can provide maximum
safety. The Conservatives failed to offer the protection
required. Labour led the call for an outright ban on all
handguns in general civilian use. There will be legislation
to allow individual MPs a free vote for a complete ban on
handguns.

Labour is the party of law and order in Britain today.

We will strengthen family life

= Help parents balance work and family

= Security in housing and help for homeowners

= Tackle homelessness using receipts from council
house sales

= Dignity and security in retirement

= Protect the basic state pension and promote secure
second pensions

We will uphold family life as the most secure means of
bringing up our children. Families are the core of our
society. They should teach right from wrong. They should
be the first defence against anti-social behaviour. The
breakdown of family life damages the fabric of our
society.

Labour does not see families and the state as rival
providers for the needs of our citizens. Families should
provide the day-to-day support for children to be brought
up in a stable and loving environment. But families
cannot flourish unless government plays its distinctive
role: in education; where necessary, in caring for the
young; in making adequate provision for illness and old
age; in supporting good parenting; and in protecting
families from lawlessness and abuse of power. Society,
through government, must assist families to achieve
collectively what no family can achieve alone.

Yet families in Britain today are under strain as never
before. The security once offered by the health service has
been undermined. Streets are not safe. Housing insecurity
grows. One in five non-pensioner families has no one
working; and British men work the longest hours in
Europe.

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 27 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

The clock should not be turned back. As many women
who want to work should be able to do so. More equal
relationships between men and women have transformed
our lives. Equally, our attitudes to race, sex and sexuality
have changed fundamentally. Our task is to combine
change and social stability.

Work and family

Families without work are without independence. This is
why we give so much emphasis to our welfare-to-work
policies.

Labour's national childcare strategy will plan provision to
match the requirements of the modern labour market and
help parents, especially women, to balance family and
working life.

There must be a sound balance between support for
family life and the protection of business from undue
burdens - a balance which some of the most successful
businesses already strike. The current government has
shown itself wholly insensitive to the need to help
develop family-friendly working practices. While
recognising the need for flexibility in implementation and
for certain exemptions, we support the right of employees
not to be forced to work more than 48 hours a week; to an
annual holiday entitlement; and to limited unpaid parental
leave. These measures will provide a valuable
underpinning to family life.

The rights of part-time workers have been clarified by
recent court judgements which we welcome.

We will keep under continuous review all aspects of the
tax and benefits systems to ensure that they are supportive
of families and children. We are committed to retain
universal Child Benefit where it is universal today - from
birth to age 16 - and to uprate it at least in line with
prices. We are reviewing educational finance and
maintenance for those older than 16 to ensure higher
staying-on rates at school and college, and that resources
are used to support those in most need. This review will
continue in government on the guidelines we have already
laid down.

Security in housing

Most families want to own their own homes. We will also
support efficiently run social and private rented sectors

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 28 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

offering quality and choice.

The Conservatives' failure on housing has been twofold.
The two thirds of families who own their homes have
suffered a massive increase in insecurity over the last
decade, with record mortgage arrears, record negative
equity and record repossessions. And the Conservatives’
lack of a housing strategy has led to the virtual
abandonment of social housing, the growth of
homelessness, and a failure to address fully leaseholder
reform. All these are the Tory legacy.

Labour's housing strategy will address the needs of
homeowners and tenants alike.

We will reject the boom and bust policies which caused
the collapse of the housing market.

We will work with mortgage providers to encourage
greater provision of more flexible mortgages to protect
families in a world of increased job insecurity.

Mortgage buyers also require stronger consumer
protection, for example by extension of the Financial
Services Act, against the sale of disadvantageous
mortgage packages.

The problems of gazumping have reappeared. Those who
break their bargains should be liable to pay the costs
inflicted on others, in particular legal and survey costs.
We are consulting on the best way of tackling the
problems of gazumping in the interests of responsible
home buyers and sellers.

The rented housing sector

We support a three-way partnership between the public,
private and housing association sectors to promote good
social housing. With Labour, capital receipts from the sale
of council houses, received but not spent by local
councils, will be re-invested in building new houses and
rehabilitating old ones. This will be phased to match the
capacity of the building industry and to meet the
requirements of prudent economic management.

We also support effective schemes to deploy private
finance to improve the public housing stock and to
introduce greater diversity and choice. Such schemes
should only go ahead with the support of the tenants
concerned: we oppose the government's threat to hand
over council housing to private landlords without the

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 29 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

consent of tenants and with no guarantees on rents or
security of tenure.

We value a revived private rented sector. We will provide
protection where most needed: for tenants in houses in
multiple occupation. There will be a proper system of
licensing by local authorities which will benefit tenants
and responsible landlords alike.

We will introduce 'commonhold', a new form of tenure
enabling people living in flats to own their homes
individually and to own the whole property collectively.
We will simplify the current rules restricting the purchase
of freeholds by leaseholders.

Homelessness

Homelessness has more than doubled under the
Conservatives. Today more than 40,000 families in
England are in expensive temporary accommodation. The
government, in the face of Labour opposition, has
removed the duty on local authorities to find permanent
housing for homeless families. We will impose a new
duty on local authorities to protect those who are
homeless through no fault of their own and are in priority
need.

There is no more powerful symbol of Tory neglect in our
society today than young people without homes living
rough on the streets. Young people emerging from care
without any family support are particularly vulnerable.
We will attack the problem in two principal ways: the
phased release of capital receipts from council house sales
will increase the stock of housing for rent; and our
welfare-to-work programme will lead the young
unemployed into work and financial independence.

Older citizens

We value the positive contribution that older people make
to our society, through their families, voluntary activities
and work. Their skills and experience should be utilised
within their communities. That is why, for example, we
support the proposal to involve older people as volunteers
to help children learn in pre-school and after-school clubs.
In work, they should not be discriminated against because
of their age.

The provision of adequate pensions in old age is a major
challenge for the future. For today's pensioners

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 30 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

Conservative policies have created real poverty, growing
inequality and widespread insecurity.

The Conservatives would abolish the state-financed basic
retirement pension and replace it with a privatised
scheme, with a vague promise of a means-tested state
guarantee if pensions fall beneath a minimum level. Their
proposals mean there will be no savings on welfare
spending for half a century; and taxes will have to rise to
make provision for new privately funded pensions. Their
plans require an additional £312 billion between now and
2040 through increased taxes or borrowing, against the
hope of savings later, with no certainty of security in
retirement at the end.

We believe that all pensioners should share fairly in the
increasing prosperity of the nation. Instead of
privatisation, we propose a partnership between public
and private provision, and a balance between income
sourced from tax and invested savings. The basic state
pension will be retained as the foundation of pension
provision. It will be increased at least in line with prices.
We will examine means of delivering more automatic
help to the poorest pensioners - one million of whom do
not even receive the Income Support which is their
present entitlement.

We will encourage saving for retirement, with proper
protection for savings. We will reform the Financial
Services Act so that the scandal of pension mis-selling -
600,000 pensions mis-sold and only 7,000 people
compensated to date - will not happen again.

Too many people in work, particularly those on low and
modest incomes and with changing patterns of
employment, cannot join good-value second pension
schemes. Labour will create a new framework -
stakeholder pensions - to meet this need. We will
encourage new partnerships between financial service
companies, employers and employees to develop these
pension schemes. They will be approved to receive
people's savings only if they meet high standards of value
for money, flexibility and security.

Labour will promote choice in pension provision. We will
support and strengthen the framework for occupational
pensions. Personal pensions, appropriately regulated, will
remain a good option for many. Labour will retain SERPS
as an option for those who wish to remain within it. We
will also seek to develop the administrative structure of
SERPS so as to create a 'citizenship pension’ for those

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 31 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

who assume responsibility as carers, as a result lose out
on the pension entitlements they would otherwise acquire,
and currently end up on means-tested benefits.

We overcame government opposition to pension splitting
between women and men on divorce. We will implement
this in government.

We aim to provide real security for families through a
modern system of community care. As people grow older,
their need for care increases. The Conservative approach
is to promote private insurance and privatisation of care
homes. But private insurance will be inaccessible to most
people. And their policy for residential homes is dogmatic
and will not work. We believe that local authorities should
be free to develop a mix of public and private care.

We recognise the immense amount of care provision
undertaken by family members, neighbours and friends. It
was a Labour MP who piloted the 1995 Carers Act
through Parliament. We will establish a Royal
Commission to work out a fair system for funding long-
term care for the elderly. We will introduce a 'long-term
care charter' defining the standard of services which
people are entitled to expect from health, housing and
social services. We are committed to an independent
inspection and regulation service for residential homes,
and domiciliary care.

Everyone is entitled to dignity in retirement. Under the
Tories, the earnings link for state pensions has been
ended, VAT on fuel has been imposed, SERPS has been
undermined and community care is in tatters. We will set
up a review of the central areas of insecurity for elderly
people: all aspects of the basic pension and its value,
second pensions including SERPS, and community care.
The review will ensure that the views of pensioners are
heard. Our watchword in developing policy for pensions
and long-term care will be to build consensus among all
interested parties.

We will help you get more out of life

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

The millennium is the time to reaffirm our responsibility
to protect and enhance our environment so that the
country we hand on to our children and our grandchildren
is a better place in which to live. It also provides a natural
opportunity to celebrate and improve the contribution
made by the arts, culture and sport to our nation. We need
a new and dynamic approach to the 'creative economy'.
The Department of National Heritage will develop a
strategic vision that matches the real power and energy of
British arts, media and cultural industries.

Protecting the environment

Our generation, and generations yet to come, are
dependent on the integrity of the environment. No one
can escape unhealthy water, polluted air or adverse
climate change. And just as these problems affect us all,
so we must act together to tackle them. No responsible
government can afford to take risks with the future: the
cost is too high. So it is our duty to act now.

The foundation of Labour's environmental approach is
that protection of the environment cannot be the sole
responsibility of any one department of state. All
departments must promote policies to sustain the
environment. And Parliament should have an
environmental audit committee to ensure high standards
across government.

Throughout this manifesto, there are policies designed to
combine environmental sustainability with economic and
social progress. They extend from commitments at local
level to give communities enhanced control over their
environments, to initiatives at international level to ensure
that all countries are contributing to the protection of the
environment.

A sustainable environment requires above all an effective
and integrated transport policy at national, regional and
local level that will provide genuine choice to meet
people's transport needs. That is what we will establish
and develop.

Railways

The process of rail privatisation is now largely complete.
It has made fortunes for a few, but has been a poor deal
for the taxpayer. It has fragmented the network and now
threatens services. Our task will be to improve the
situation as we find it, not as we wish it to be. Our

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 33 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

overriding goal must be to win more passengers and
freight on to rail. The system must be run in the public
interest with higher levels of investment and effective
enforcement of train operators' service commitments.
There must be convenient connections, through-ticketing
and accurate travel information for the benefit of all
passengers.

To achieve these aims, we will establish more effective
and accountable regulation by the rail regulator; we will
ensure that the public subsidy serves the public interest;
and we will establish a new rail authority, combining
functions currently carried out by the rail franchiser and
the Department of Transport, to provide a clear, coherent
and strategic programme for the development of the
railways so that passenger expectations are met.

The Conservative plan for the wholesale privatisation of
London Underground is not the answer. It would be a
poor deal for the taxpayer and passenger alike. Yet again,
public assets would be sold off at an under-valued rate.
Much-needed investment would be delayed. The core
public responsibilities of the Underground would be
threatened.

Labour plans a new public/private partnership to improve
the Underground, safeguard its commitment to the public
interest and guarantee value for money to taxpayers and
passengers.

Road transport

A balanced transport system must cater for all the familiar
modes of transport: cars - whether owned, leased or
shared; taxis; buses; bicycles and motorcycles. All needs
must be addressed in transport planning to ensure the best
mix of all types of transport, offer quality public transport
wherever possible and help to protect the environment.

The key to efficient bus services is proper regulation at
local level, with partnerships between local councils and
bus operators an essential component. There must be
improved provision and enforcement of bus lanes. Better
parking facilities for cars must be linked to convenient
bus services to town centres.

Road safety is a high priority. Cycling and walking must
be made safer, especially around schools.

We remain unpersuaded by the case for heavier, 44-tonne
lorries mooted by the Conservatives. Our concern is that

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 34 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

they would prove dangerous and damaging to the
environment.

Our plans to reduce pollution include working with the
automotive industry to develop 'smart', efficient and clean
cars for the future, with substantially reduced emission
levels. The review of vehicle excise duty to promote low-
emission vehicles will be continued.

We will conduct an overall strategic review of the roads
programme against the criteria of accessibility, safety,
economy and environmental impact, using public/private
partnerships to improve road maintenance and exploiting
new technology to improve journey information.

Shipping and aviation

The Tory years have seen the near-extinction of Britain's
merchant fleet. Labour will work with all concerned in
shipping and ports to help develop their economic
potential to the full.

The guiding objectives of our aviation strategy will be fair
competition, safety and environmental standards. We
want all British carriers to be able to compete fairly in the
interests of consumers.

Life in our countryside

Labour recognises the special needs of people who live
and work in rural areas. The Conservatives do not. Public
services and transport services in rural areas must not be
allowed to deteriorate. The Conservatives have tried to
privatise the Post Office. We opposed that, in favour of a
public Post Office providing a comprehensive service.
Conservative plans would mean higher charges for letters
and put rural post offices under threat.

We favour a moratorium on large-scale sales of Forestry
Commission land. We recognise that the countryside is a
great natural asset, a part of our heritage which calls for
careful stewardship. This must be balanced, however,
with the needs of people who live and work in rural areas.

The total failure of the Conservatives to manage the BSE
crisis effectively and to secure any raising of the ban on
British beef has wreaked havoc on the beef and dairy
industries. The cost to the taxpayer so far is £3.5 billion.

Labour aims to reform the Common Agricultural Policy
to save money, to support the rural economy and enhance

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 35 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

the environment.

Our initiatives to link all schools to the information
superhighway will ensure that children in rural areas have
access to the best educational resources.

Our policies include greater freedom for people to explore
our open countryside. We will not, however, permit any
abuse of a right to greater access.

We will ensure greater protection for wildlife. We have
advocated new measures to promote animal welfare,
including a free vote in Parliament on whether hunting
with hounds should be banned by legislation.

Angling is Britain's most popular sport. Labour's anglers'
charter affirms our long-standing commitment to angling
and to the objective of protecting the aquatic
environment.

Arts and culture

The arts, culture and sport are central to the task of
recreating the sense of community, identity and civic
pride that should define our country. Yet we consistently
undervalue the role of the arts and culture in helping to
create a civic society - from amateur theatre to our art
galleries.

Art, sport and leisure are vital to our quality of life and
the renewal of our economy. They are significant earners
for Britain. They employ hundreds of thousands of
people. They bring millions of tourists to Britain every
year, who will also be helped by Labour's plans for new
quality assurance in hotel accommodation.

We propose to set up a National Endowment for Science
and the Arts to sponsor young talent. NESTA will be a
national trust - for talent rather than buildings - for the
21st century. NESTA will be partly funded by the lottery;
and artists who have gained high rewards from their
excellence in the arts and wish to support young talent
will be encouraged to donate copyright and royalties to
NESTA.

Sport
A Labour government will take the lead in extending

opportunities for participation in sports; and in identifying
sporting excellence and supporting it.

School sports must be the foundation. We will bring the

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 36 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

government's policy of forcing schools to sell off playing
fields to an end. We will provide full backing to the bid to
host the 2006 football World Cup in England. A Labour
government will also work to bring the Olympics and
other major international sporting events to Britain.

A people's lottery

The lottery has been a financial success. But there has
been no overall strategy for the allocation of monies; and
no co-ordination among the five distributor bodies about
the projects deserving to benefit from lottery funding. For
example, the multi-million-pound expenditure on the
Churchill papers caused national outrage. A Labour
government will review the distribution of lottery
proceeds to ensure that there is the widest possible access
to the benefits of lottery revenues throughout the UK.

Labour has already proposed a new millennium
commission to commence after the closure of the
Millennium Exhibition, to provide direct support for a
range of education, environment and public health
projects, including those directed at children's play, a
project currently excluded from lottery benefit.

Because the lottery is a monopoly intended to serve the
public interest, it must be administered efficiently and
economically. When the current contract runs out, Labour
will seek an efficient not-for-profit operator to ensure that
the maximum sums go to good causes.

Media and broadcasting

Labour aims for a thriving, diverse media industry,
combining commercial success and public service. We
will ensure that the BBC continues to be a flagship for
British creativity and public service broadcasting, but we
believe that the combination of public and private sectors
in competition is a key spur to innovation and high
standards. The regulatory framework for media and
broadcasting should reflect the realities of a far more open
and competitive economy, and enormous technological
advance, for example with digital television. Labour will
balance sensible rules, fair regulation and national and
international competition, so maintaining quality and
diversity for the benefit of viewers.

Citizens' service for a new millennium

An independent and creative voluntary sector, committed

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 37 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

to voluntary activity as an expression of citizenship, is
central to our vision of a stakeholder society. We are
committed to developing plans for a national citizens!
service programme, to tap the enthusiasm and
commitment of the many young people who want to make
voluntary contributions in service of their communities.
The millennium should harness the imagination of all
those people who have so much to offer for the benefit of
the community. We do not believe programmes should be
imposed from the top down, but on the contrary wish to
encourage a broad range of voluntary initiatives devised
and developed by people within their own communities.

We will clean up politics

= End the hereditary principle in the House of Lords

= Reform of party funding to end sleaze

= Devolved power in Scotland and Wales

= Elected mayors for London and other cities

= More independent but accountable local
government

= Freedom of information and guaranteed human
rights

The Conservatives seem opposed to the very idea of
democracy. They support hereditary peers, unaccountable
quangos and secretive government. They have debased
democracy through their MPs who have taken cash for
asking questions in the House of Commons. They are
opposed to the development of decentralised government.
The party which once opposed universal suffrage and
votes for women now says our constitution is so perfect
that it cannot be improved.

Our system of government is centralised, inefficient and
bureaucratic. Our citizens cannot assert their basic rights
in our own courts. The Conservatives are afflicted by
sleaze and prosper from secret funds from foreign
supporters. There is unquestionably a national crisis of
confidence in our political system, to which Labour will
respond in a measured and sensible way.

A modern House of Lords

The House of Lords must be reformed. As an initial, self-
contained reform, not dependent on further reform in the
future, the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the
House of Lords will be ended by statute. This will be the
first stage in a process of reform to make the House of
Lords more democratic and representative. The legislative

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 38 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

powers of the House of Lords will remain unaltered.

The system of appointment of life peers to the House of
Lords will be reviewed. Our objective will be to ensure
that over time party appointees as life peers more
accurately reflect the proportion of votes cast at the
previous general election. We are committed to
maintaining an independent cross-bench presence of life
peers. No one political party should seek a majority in the
House of Lords.

A committee of both Houses of Parliament will be
appointed to undertake a wide-ranging review of possible
further change and then to bring forward proposals for
reform.

We have no plans to replace the monarchy.
An effective House of Commons

We believe the House of Commons is in need of
modernisation and we will ask the House to establish a
special Select Committee to review its procedures. Prime
Minister's Questions will be made more effective.
Ministerial accountability will be reviewed so as to
remove recent abuses. The process for scrutinising
European legislation will be overhauled.

The Nolan recommendations will be fully implemented
and extended to all public bodies. We will oblige parties
to declare the source of all donations above a minimum
figure: Labour does this voluntarily and all parties should
do so. Foreign funding will be banned. We will ask the
Nolan Committee to consider how the funding of political
parties should be regulated and reformed.

We are committed to a referendum on the voting system
for the House of Commons. An independent commission
on voting systems will be appointed early to recommend a
proportional alternative to the first-past-the-post system.

At this election, Labour is proud to be making major
strides to rectify the under-representation of women in
public life.

Open government

Unnecessary secrecy in government leads to arrogance in
government and defective policy decisions. The Scott
Report on arms to Iraq revealed Conservative abuses of
power. We are pledged to a Freedom of Information Act,

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 39 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

leading to more open government, and an independent
National Statistical Service.

Devolution: strengthening the Union

The United Kingdom is a partnership enriched by distinct
national identities and traditions. Scotland has its own
systems of education, law and local government. Wales
has its language and cultural traditions. We will meet the
demand for decentralisation of power to Scotland and
Wales, once established in referendums.

Subsidiarity is as sound a principle in Britain as it is in
Europe. Our proposal is for devolution not federation. A
sovereign Westminster Parliament will devolve power to
Scotland and Wales. The Union will be strengthened and
the threat of separatism removed.

As soon as possible after the election, we will enact
legislation to allow the people of Scotland and Wales to
vote in separate referendums on our proposals, which will
be set out in white papers. These referendums will take
place not later than the autumn of 1997. A simple
majority of those voting in each referendum will be the
majority required. Popular endorsement will strengthen
the legitimacy of our proposals and speed their passage
through Parliament.

For Scotland we propose the creation of a parliament with
law-making powers, firmly based on the agreement
reached in the Scottish Constitutional Convention,
including defined and limited financial powers to vary
revenue and elected by an additional member system. In
the Scottish referendum we will seek separate
endorsement of the proposal to create a parliament, and of
the proposal to give it defined and limited financial
powers to vary revenue. The Scottish parliament will
extend democratic control over the responsibilities
currently exercised administratively by the Scottish
Office. The responsibilities of the UK Parliament will
remain unchanged over UK policy, for example
economic, defence and foreign policy.

The Welsh assembly will provide democratic control of
the existing Welsh Office functions. It will have
secondary legislative powers and will be specifically
empowered to reform and democratise the quango state. It
will be elected by an additional member system.

Following majorities in the referendums, we will
introduce in the first year of the Parliament legislation on

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 40 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

the substantive devolution proposals outlined in our white
papers.

Good local government

Local decision-making should be less constrained by
central government, and also more accountable to local
people. We will place on councils a new duty to promote
the economic, social and environmental well-being of
their area. They should work in partnership with local
people, local business and local voluntary organisations.
They will have the powers necessary to develop these
partnerships. To ensure greater accountability, a
proportion of councillors in each locality will be elected
annually. We will encourage democratic innovations in
local government, including pilots of the idea of elected
mayors with executive powers in cities.

Although crude and universal council tax capping should
go, we will retain reserve powers to control excessive
council tax rises.

Local business concerns are critical to good local
government. There are sound democratic reasons why, in
principle, the business rate should be set locally, not
nationally. But we will make no change to the present
system for determining the business rate without full
consultation with business.

The funnelling of government grant to Conservative-
controlled Westminster speaks volumes about the
unfairness of the current grant system. Labour is
committed to a fair distribution of government grant. The
basic framework, not every detail, of local service
provision must be for central government. Councils
should not be forced to put their services out to tender, but
will be required to obtain best value. We reject the
dogmatic view that services must be privatised to be of
high quality, but equally we see no reason why a service
should be delivered directly if other more efficient means
are available. Cost counts but so does quality.

Every council will be required to publish a local
performance plan with targets for service improvement,
and be expected to achieve them. The Audit Commission
will be given additional powers to monitor performance
and promote efficiency. On its advice, government will
where necessary send in a management team with full
powers to remedy failure.

Labour councils have been at the forefront of

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 41 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

environmental initiatives under Local Agenda 21, the
international framework for local action arising from the
1992 Earth Summit. A Labour government will encourage
all local authorities to adopt plans to protect and enhance
their local environment.

Local government is at the sharp end of the fight against
deprivation. Ten years after the Conservatives promised to
improve the inner cities, poverty and social division afflict
towns and outer estates alike. A Labour government will
join with local government in a concerted attack against
the multiple causes of social and economic decline -
unemployment, bad housing, crime, poor health and a
degraded environment.

London

London is the only Western capital without an elected city
government. Following a referendum to confirm popular
demand, there will be a new deal for London, with a
strategic authority and a mayor, each directly elected.
Both will speak up for the needs of the city and plan its
future. They will not duplicate the work of the boroughs,
but take responsibility for London-wide issues - economic
regeneration, planning, policing, transport and
environmental protection. London-wide responsibility for
its own government is urgently required. We will make it
happen.

The regions of England

The Conservatives have created a tier of regional
government in England through quangos and government
regional offices. Meanwhile local authorities have come
together to create a more co-ordinated regional voice.
Labour will build on these developments through the
establishment of regional chambers to co-ordinate
transport, planning, economic development, bids for
European funding and land use planning.

Demand for directly elected regional government so
varies across England that it would be wrong to impose a
uniform system. In time we will introduce legislation to
allow the people, region by region, to decide ina
referendum whether they want directly elected regional
government. Only where clear popular consent is
established will arrangements be made for elected
regional assemblies. This would require a predominantly
unitary system of local government, as presently exists in
Scotland and Wales, and confirmation by independent

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 42 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

auditors that no additional public expenditure overall
would be involved. Our plans will not mean adding a new
tier of government to the existing English system.

Real rights for citizens

Citizens should have statutory rights to enforce their
human rights in the UK courts. We will by statute
incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights
into UK law to bring these rights home and allow our
people access to them in their national courts. The
incorporation of the European Convention will establish a
floor, not a ceiling, for human rights. Parliament will
remain free to enhance these rights, for example by a
Freedom of Information Act.

We will seek to end unjustifiable discrimination wherever
it exists. For example, we support comprehensive,
enforceable civil rights for disabled people against
discrimination in society or at work, developed in
partnership with all interested parties.

Labour will undertake a wide-ranging review both of the
reform of the civil justice system and Legal Aid. We will
achieve value for money for the taxpayer and the
consumer. A community legal service will develop local,
regional and national plans for the development of Legal
Aid according to the needs and priorities of regions and
areas. The key to success will be to promote a partnership
between the voluntary sector, the legal profession and the
Legal Aid Board.

Every country must have firm control over immigration
and Britain is no exception. All applications, however,
should be dealt with speedily and fairly. There are, rightly,
criteria for those who want to enter this country to join
husband or wife. We will ensure that these are properly
enforced. We will, however, reform the system in current
use to remove the arbitrary and unfair results that can
follow from the existing ‘primary purpose' rule. There will
be a streamlined system of appeals for visitors denied a
visa.

The system for dealing with asylum seekers is expensive
and slow - there are many undecided cases dating back
beyond 1993. We will ensure swift and fair decisions on
whether someone can stay or go, control unscrupulous
immigration advisors and crack down on the fraudulent
use of birth certificates.

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

Northern Ireland

Labour's approach to the peace process has been
bipartisan. We have supported the recent agreements
between the two governments - the Anglo-Irish
Agreement, the Downing Street Declaration and the
Framework Document. The government has tabled
proposals which include a new devolved legislative body,
as well as cross-border co-operation and continued
dialogue between the two governments.

There will be as great a priority attached to seeing that
process through with Labour as under the Conservatives,
in co-operation with the Irish government and the
Northern Ireland parties. We will expect the same
bipartisan approach from a Conservative opposition.

We will take effective measures to combat the terrorist
threat.

There is now general acceptance that the future of
Northern Ireland must be determined by the consent of
the people as set out in the Downing Street Declaration.
Labour recognises that the option of a united Ireland does
not command the consent of the Unionist tradition, nor
does the existing status of Northern Ireland command the
consent of the Nationalist tradition. We are therefore
committed to reconciliation between the two traditions
and to a new political settlement which can command the
support of both. Labour will help build trust and
confidence among both Nationalist and Unionist
traditions in Northern Ireland by acting to guarantee
human rights, strengthen confidence in policing, combat
discrimination at work and reduce tensions over parades.
Labour will also foster economic progress and
competitiveness in Northern Ireland, so as to reduce
unemployment.

We will give Britain leadership in
Europe

= Referendum on single currency

= Lead reform of the EU

= Retain Trident: strong defence through NATO
= Areformed United Nations

= Helping to tackle global poverty

Britain, though an island nation with limited natural
resources, has for centuries been a leader of nations. But

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

under the Conservatives Britain's influence has waned.

With a new Labour government, Britain will be strong in
defence; resolute in standing up for its own interests; an
advocate of human rights and democracy the world over;
a reliable and powerful ally in the international
institutions of which we are a member; and will be a
leader in Europe.

Our vision of Europe is of an alliance of independent
nations choosing to co-operate to achieve the goals they
cannot achieve alone. We oppose a European federal
superstate.

There are only three options for Britain in Europe. The
first is to come out. The second is to stay in, but on the
sidelines. The third is to stay in, but in a leading role.

An increasing number of Conservatives, overtly or
covertly, favour the first. But withdrawal would be
disastrous for Britain. It would put millions of jobs at risk.
It would dry up inward investment. It would destroy our
clout in international trade negotiations. It would relegate
Britain from the premier division of nations.

The second is exactly where we are today under the
Conservatives. The BSE fiasco symbolises their failures
in Europe.

The third is the path a new Labour government will take.
A fresh start in Europe, with the credibility to achieve
reform. We have set out a detailed agenda for reform,
leading from the front during the UK presidency in the
first half of 1998:

= Rapid completion of the single market: a top
priority for the British presidency. We will open up
markets to competition; pursue tough action against
unfair state aids; and ensure proper enforcement of
single market rules. This will strengthen Europe's
competitiveness and open up new opportunities for
British firms.

= High priority for enlargement of the European
Union to include the countries of central and
eastern Europe and Cyprus, and the institutional
reforms necessary to make an enlarged Europe
work more efficiently.

= Urgent reform of the Common Agricultural
Policy. It is costly, vulnerable to fraud and not
geared to environmental protection. Enlargement
and the World Trade talks in 1999 will make reform

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 45 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

even more essential. We will seek a thorough
overhaul of the Common Fisheries Policy to
conserve our fish stocks in the long-term interests
of the UK fishing industry.

= Greater openness and democracy in EU
institutions with open voting in the Council of
Ministers and more effective scrutiny of the
Commission by the European Parliament. We have
long supported a proportional voting system for
election to the European Parliament.

= Retention of the national veto over key matters
of national interest, such as taxation, defence and
security, immigration, decisions over the budget
and treaty changes, while considering the extension
of Qualified Majority Voting in limited areas where
that is in Britain's interests.

= Britain to sign the Social Chapter. An ‘empty
chair' at the negotiating table is disastrous for
Britain. The Social Chapter is a framework under
which legislative measures can be agreed. Only two
measures have been agreed - consultation for
employees of large Europe-wide companies and
entitlement to unpaid parental leave. Successful
companies already work closely with their
workforces. The Social Chapter cannot be used to
force the harmonisation of social security or tax
legislation and it does not cost jobs. We will use our
participation to promote employability and
flexibility, not high social costs.

The single currency

Any decision about Britain joining the single currency
must be determined by a hard-headed assessment of
Britain's economic interests. Only Labour can be trusted
to do this: the Tories are riven by faction. But there are
formidable obstacles in the way of Britain being in the
first wave of membership, if EMU takes place on 1
January 1999. What is essential for the success of EMU is
genuine convergence among the economies that take part,
without any fudging of the rules. However, to exclude
British membership of EMU forever would be to destroy
any influence we have over a process which will affect us
whether we are in or out. We must therefore play a full
part in the debate to influence it in Britain's interests.

In any event, there are three pre-conditions which would
have to be satisfied before Britain could join during the
next Parliament: first, the Cabinet would have to agree;
then Parliament; and finally the people would have to say

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 46 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

'Yes' in a referendum.

Strong defence through NATO

The post-Cold War world faces a range of new security
challenges - proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
the growth of ethnic nationalism and extremism,
international terrorism, and crime and drug trafficking. A
new Labour government will build a strong defence
against these threats. Our security will continue to be
based on NATO.

Our armed forces are among the most effective in the
world. The country takes pride in their professionalism
and courage. We will ensure that they remain strong to
defend Britain. But the security of Britain is best served in
a secure world, so we should be willing to contribute to
wider international peace and security both through the
alliances to which we belong, in particular NATO and the
Western European Union, and through other international
organisations such as the UN and the Organisation for
Security and Co-operation in Europe.

Labour will conduct a strategic defence and security
review to reassess our essential security interests and
defence needs. It will consider how the roles, missions
and capabilities of our armed forces should be adjusted to
meet the new strategic realities. The review we propose
will be foreign policy led, first assessing our likely
overseas commitments and interests and then establishing
how our forces should be deployed to meet them.

Arms control

A new Labour government will retain Trident. We will
press for multilateral negotiations towards mutual,
balanced and verifiable reductions in nuclear weapons.
When satisfied with verified progress towards our goal of
the global elimination of nuclear weapons, we will ensure
that British nuclear weapons are included in multilateral
negotiations.

Labour will work for the effective implementation of the
Chemical Weapons Convention and for a strengthening of
the Biological Weapons Convention. Labour will ban the
import, export, transfer and manufacture of all forms of
anti-personnel landmines. We will introduce an
immediate moratorium on their use. Labour will not
permit the sale of arms to regimes that might use them for
internal repression or international aggression. We will

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 47 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

increase the transparency and accountability of decisions
on export licences for arms. And we will support an EU
code of conduct governing arms sales.

We support a strong UK defence industry, which is a
strategic part of our industrial base as well as our defence
effort. We believe that part of its expertise can be
extended to civilian use through a defence diversification
agency.

Leadership in the international community

A new Labour government will use Britain's permanent
seat on the Security Council to press for substantial
reform of the United Nations, including an early
resolution of its funding crisis, and a more effective role
in peacekeeping, conflict prevention, the protection of
human rights and safeguarding the global environment.

The Commonwealth provides Britain with a unique
network of contacts linked by history, language and legal
systems. Labour is committed to giving renewed priority
to the Commonwealth in our foreign relations. We will
seize the opportunity to increase trade and economic co-
operation and will also build alliances with our
Commonwealth partners to promote reform at the UN and
common action on the global environment. Britain has a
real opportunity to provide leadership to the
Commonwealth when we host the heads of government
meeting in Britain at the end of 1997.

Promoting economic and social development

Labour will also attach much higher priority to combating
global poverty and underdevelopment. According to the
World Bank, there are 1.3 billion people in the world
who live in absolute poverty, subsisting on less than US$1
a day, while 35,000 children die each day from readily
preventable diseases.

Labour believes that we have a clear moral responsibility
to help combat global poverty. In government we will
strengthen and restructure the British aid programme and
bring development issues back into the mainstream of
government decision-making. A Cabinet minister will
lead a new department of international development.

We will shift aid resources towards programmes that help

the poorest people in the poorest countries. We reaffirm
the UK's commitment to the 0.7 per cent UN aid target

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 48 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

and in government Labour will start to reverse the decline
in UK aid spending.

We will work for greater consistency between the aid,
trade, agriculture and economic reform policies of the
EU. We will use our leadership position in the EU to
maintain and enhance the position of the poorest countries
during the renegotiation of the Lomo Convention.

We will support further measures to reduce the debt
burden borne by the world's poorest countries and to
ensure that developing countries are given a fair deal in
international trade. It is our aim to rejoin UNESCO. We
will consider how this can be done most effectively and
will ensure that the cost is met from savings elsewhere.

Human rights

Labour wants Britain to be respected in the world for the
integrity with which it conducts its foreign relations. We
will make the protection and promotion of human rights a
central part of our foreign policy. We will work for the
creation of a permanent international criminal court to
investigate genocide, war crimes and crimes against
humanity.

A new environmental internationalism

Labour believes that the threats to the global climate
should push environmental concerns higher up the
international agenda. A Labour government will
strengthen co-operation in the European Union on
environmental issues, including climate change and ozone
depletion. We will lead the fight against global warming,
through our target of a 20 per cent reduction in carbon
dioxide emissions by the year 2010.

Labour believes the international environment should be
safeguarded in negotiations over international trade. We
will also work for the successful negotiation of a new
protocol on climate change to be completed in Japan in
1997.

Leadership, not isolation

There is a sharp division between those who believe the
way to cope with global change is for nations to retreat
into isolationism and protectionism, and those who
believe in internationalism and engagement. Labour has
traditionally been the party of internationalism. Britain

http://labourmanifesto.com/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 49 of 50

1997 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

cannot be strong at home if it is weak abroad. The tragedy
of the Conservative years has been the squandering of
Britain's assets and the loss of Britain's influence.

A new Labour government will use those assets to the full
to restore Britain's pride and influence as a leading force
for good in the world. With effective leadership and clear
vision, Britain could once again be at the centre of
international decision-making instead of at its margins.

This manifesto contains the detail of our plans. We
have promised only what we know we can deliver.
Britain deserves better and the following five election
pledges will be the first steps towards a better Britain.

= cut class sizes to 30 or under for 5,6 and 7 year-
olds by using money from the assisted places
scheme

offenders by halving the time from arrest to
sentencing

patients as a first step by releasing £100 million
saved from NHS red tape

= get 250,000 under-25 year-olds off benefit and into
work by using money from a windfall levy on the
privatised utilities

= no rise in income tax rates, cut VAT on heating to 5
per cent and inflation and interest rates as low as
possible

Fulfilling Britain's great potential

This general election is in many ways even more important than the
last. Since May 1997 we have laid the foundations of a Britain
whose economy is stronger, where investment is now pouring into
public services, where social division is being slowly healed and
where influence abroad is being regained.

But these are only the foundations of larger change. Now is the chance to
build the future properly, to make the second term the basis for a radical
programme of British renewal: to keep a firm grip on inflation, with low
interest rates and the public finances sound, and then build the dynamic and
productive economy of the future; to keep investment coming into public
services and then making the reforms so we use the money well; to refashion
the welfare state on the basis of rights and responsibilities, with people
helped to help themselves, not just given handouts; to ensure all families are
safe in their communities by tackling crime and its causes; and to give
Britain back its leadership role in the world. We need the second term to do
all this. That is the choice: to make progress or to dismantle the foundations
laid. And with the state of today's Conservatives, the choice is stark.

This choice will decide whether more people will be able to realise their
aspirations for themselves and their children — to be able to rely on a stable

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 2 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

economy where hard work is rewarded by rising living standards, to receive
world-class education and healthcare, to enjoy a dignified old age, to feel
safe and secure in a strong community, and to be proud to be British. Or
whether we will be held back by the traditional British malaise of restricting
life's great opportunities and blessings to a minority.

There is much still to be done, but we have come a long way in four years.
Britain stands more prosperous, more equal, more respected. Our country is
on a new course.

My passion is to continue the modernisation of Britain in favour of hard-
working families, so that all our children, wherever they live, whatever their
background, have an equal chance to benefit from the opportunities our
country has to offer and to share in its wealth.

The challenge for Britain

I am honoured to be Prime Minister. And I have a confident belief in our
country. We are not boastful. But we have real strengths. Great people.
Strong values. A proud history.

The British people achieved magnificent things in the 20th century. But for
too long, our strengths have been undermined by weaknesses of elitism and
snobbery, vested interests and social division, complacency bred by harking
back to the past. We achieved spurts of economic growth, but inflation
would then get out of control. Our welfare state was founded to offer
security, but its progress was stalled. We reached out to Europe, then drew
back to become semi-detached.

It is as if a glass ceiling has stopped us fulfilling our potential. In the 21st
century, we have the opportunity to break through that glass ceiling, because
our historic strengths match the demands of the modern world.

We can use our openness and entrepreneurial flair to become a global centre
in the knowledge economy. We can use our sense of fair play and mutual
responsibility to be a strong, dynamic, multiracial society held together by
strong values. We can use our historic and geographical position to link
Europe and America, and help the developing world.

The key to tapping our strengths, to breaking through this glass ceiling, is
contained in a simple but hard-to-achieve idea, set out at the heart of our
party’s constitution: the determination to put power, wealth and opportunity
in the hands of the many, not the few.

I know as well as anyone that we have just begun; millions of hard-working
families want, need and deserve more. That means more change in a second

term, not less — to extend opportunity for all. We reject the quiet life. We
must secure a mandate for change.

Ten goals for 2010

Shifting the odds for hard-working families

In 1997 we promised a start, not a revolution. We made five specific five-
year pledges. Three have been completed early; all will be completed within
five years, as we promised.

Each pledge is matched by further achievement: the lowest inflation and
unemployment for a generation; one million new jobs; over 17,000 extra
nurses, the best primary school test results ever and, as the British Crime
Survey shows, crime is down by ten per cent.

We also offered a ten-point contract to the British people. The results are at
the back of this manifesto. Not everything has gone right — it never does. But
we are getting there, easing burdens and extending opportunities, by choice
not chance.

Economic instability wrecks the lives of hard-working families So we
chose to put the public finances right. It meant tough decisions that were
opposed by the Conservatives. But today the economy is stable and growing,
and interest rates are nearly half the level they averaged under the
Conservatives.

Unemployment steals dignity. So we chose to introduce a windfall tax on
the excess profits of the privatised utilities and to use the money to help
unemployed people back to work. That was opposed by the Conservatives,
who are now pledged to abolish the New Deal. But today, youth
unemployment is at its lowest level since 1975 and long-term unemployment
at its lowest level since 1978.

Poor education is a cruel injustice. So we chose to introduce a new system
for teaching the basics in primary schools. We met opposition, and the
Conservatives want to roll back our programmes. But today, primary schools
are achieving their best results ever.

A run-down health service causes insecurity. So we chose to reform the
NHS, and inject new money. Waiting lists and times are now down and

falling, and the number of nurses and doctors is now rising.

Poverty denies basic rights. So we chose to reform the welfare state to

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 4 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

channel extra money to the poorest pensioners and poorest children. Today,
single pensioners can look forward to a minimum income of £100 a week
and pensioner couples £154, and over one million children have been taken
out of poverty.

The centralisation of power only helps the powerful. So we chose to
break the suffocating centralisation of British government. The UK has been
strengthened. Today, it is the Conservatives who threaten the stability of the
UK with their proposals for two classes of MP. Our Scottish and Welsh
manifestos, alongside this one, set out our vision for continued partnership.

Isolation from Europe does not help anyone. So we chose to engage
constructively in Europe, not to shout abuse from the sidelines. Today,
Europe is moving in a direction that is good for Britain and good for Europe.
In policy for aid, development and international debt relief, we have led the
way.

Of course, there are still big problems, but we are better off, better educated,
better governed, better respected abroad. There has been another change too
- achange of priorities and values.

We learnt in the 1980s that looking after number one was not enough; that
without opportunity, responsibility was weak; that an unfair society was a
less prosperous one. The philosophy was wrong — it hurt millions of families
and left our country with lasting problems.

We have shown we are a reformed party, competent to govern. Now we offer
more. More change, and more rewards for Britain's hard-working families:
more prosperity, more opportunities, more security.

Ambitions for Britain

Stretching the family budget, finding time for children as well as work,
holding on to mutual respect, staying healthy when there can be danger even
in the air we breathe. These are daily worries that people face.

They are my concerns too. But, while there is always a market for people
who say we are doomed, that all new ideas are bad ideas even as things
improve, that we might as well curl up with our prejudices and shut the door
on the world, I am an optimist. New Labour is ambitious for Britain's future
and is ready to lead.

First, we will sustain economic stability and build deeper prosperity that
reaches every region of the country. Skills, infrastructure, the
technological revolution — all are vital to raise British living standards faster.
We will put as much energy into helping the seven million adults without
basic skills as we did when tackling long-term unemployment through the
New Deal.

Second, we seek to achieve a renaissance of status and quality for public
services and their staff. We will build on our success in primary schools to

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 5 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

overhaul secondary schools; we will invest new resources and empower
doctors and nurses to transform health services; and we will seek to extend
the very best in culture and sport to all.

Third, we seek to modernise the welfare state. The benefits system will be
restructured around work; support for children and families through the tax
and benefits system will be transformed; cash and services for pensioners
will be radically improved.

Fourth, we will strengthen our communities. We will reform the criminal
justice system at every level so that criminals are caught, punished and
rehabilitated. And because we know that without tackling the causes of
crime we will never tackle crime, we will empower local communities by
combining resources with responsibility.

Fifth, we will turn our inner confidence to strength abroad, in Europe
and beyond, to tackle global problems — above all, environmental
degradation and the shame of global poverty. We will engage fully in
Europe, help enlarge the European Union and make it more effective, and
insist that the British people have the final say on any proposal to join the
Euro.

These ambitions are summarised in ten goals for 2010. They will never be
achieved by government alone. We know it is people who ultimately change
the country. Our partnership with the voluntary sector has steadily
strengthened since 1997, as we learn from its diversity. We work with the
private sector, drawing on its vitality. Countries only prosper on the basis of
partnership — between government, employers and their employees, and the
voluntary sector. What Britain needs is an active, enabling state, not a nanny
state, doing things with people not to them.

So, while the Conservatives will spend most of this election telling you what
their government cannot do, this manifesto sets out what our government
can do. We know the power and value of markets, but we also know their
limits. Now is the time to renew our civic and social institutions to deliver
improvements in education, health, safety, transport and the environment.

Fighting for values, not just for election victory

The Conservatives always look back.

In economic policy they promise to repeat the mistakes of the 1980s -
unaffordable tax cuts and spending cuts, followed by ballooning deficits,
rising interest rates and the old cycle of boom and bust.

In social policy their renewed commitment to cuts and privatisation and to
withdrawing the support helping to heal social division, is just a throwback
to the 1980s.

In foreign policy they risk not just isolation but exit from the EU. Jobs,
trade, investment depend on our membership of the European Union. The

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 6 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

Conservative policy of opposing the enlargement of Europe in the Nice
Treaty and their pledge to renegotiate the terms of Britain's EU membership
is dangerous and ill thought-out. Standing up for Britain means fighting for
Britain's interests in Europe, not leaving Europe — which threatens our
national interest.

So the choice Britain faces today is starker than in 1997. The Conservatives
have swung further to the right. And, in government, Labour's agenda has
become increasingly bold and ambitious.

For many years, the Conservatives claimed to offer economic strength while
Labour dominated social issues. Many people found their head telling them
to vote Tory, and their heart telling them to vote Labour.

Today, head and heart are coming together. New Labour is proving that it is
only by using the talents of all that we get a healthy economy, and that it is
only by giving a stake to all that we are a healthy society.

We have made our choice: stability not boom and bust; investment not cuts;
engagement not isolationism; the many, not the few.

A lot done and a lot more to do with new Labour — or a lot for you to lose
under the Conservatives.

I deeply believe that, for Britain, the best is still to come. So I ask you to
continue on this journey with us. Together we can achieve so much more.

Renewal of our public services is at the centre of new Labour's manifesto.

A single aim drives our policy programme: to liberate people's potential, by
spreading power, wealth and opportunity more widely, breaking down the
barriers that hold people back.

But this is only possible on the continued foundation of economic stability:
mortgages as low as possible, low inflation and sound public finances.

The manifesto is comprehensive. Here we set out some of the key measures
for investment and reform that we believe give us a historic opportunity to

modernise our schools, NHS, criminal justice system and welfare state.

Renewing public services: substantial investment

New Labour believes that Britain needs investment in schools and hospitals,
not reckless tax cuts.

Before 1997 we promised and kept to two tough years on spending to get the
public finances in shape. Now, consistent with meeting our fiscal rules, we
promise substantial rises for key public services. To help deliver our plans,
our ten-year goal is the renewal of local government.

We will now:

* increase education spending by more than five per cent in real terms
each year for the next three years as we increase the share of national
income for education in the next Parliament

* increase health spending by an average of six per cent in real terms
each year for the next three years

* increase spending on our police — an extra £1.6 billion a year by
2003/04

* increase spending on transport by 20 per cent for the next three years,
on our way to a £180 billion investment of public and private money
for transport over the next ten years

¢ use a £400 million reward fund for local government in return for
signing up to clear targets to improve local services

Economic stability: the foundation

New Labour believes that a stable economy is the platform for rising living
standards and opportunity for all

Our ten-year goals are for long-term economic stability and faster
productivity growth than our main competitors.

We will now:

¢ deliver economic stability with mortgages as low as possible, low
inflation and sound public finances

e reform further education, and help 750,000 adults achieve basic skills

¢ expand the Children's Tax Credit to offer up to £1,000 per year for
parents of newborn children

* create a new Child Trust Fund for every child at birth

* increase the minimum wage to £4.20

* not raise the basic or top rate of income tax and extend the 10p band

¢ strengthen regional economies with venture capital funds and new
powers for reformed Regional Development Agencies

¢ develop the Small Business Service and cut red tape give British
people the final say in any referendum on the single currency

Renewing public services: more frontline staff

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

New Labour believes in renewing a public service ethic by giving frontline
staff new freedoms to respond to public needs

For public services to be renewed, we will need more staff, properly
rewarded. It is these frontline staff, operating in new ways, who will drive up
standards in our key public services. We will decentralise power to make
that possible.

We will now deliver:

¢ 20,000 more nurses who will be given new enhanced roles and more
power for matrons and ward sisters with control over budgets

e 10,000 more doctors, and access to a £500 million Performance Fund
to spend on new patient services

¢ 10,000 more teachers. Invest in further rapid promotion and rewards
for classroom excellence, more classroom assistants and help with
housing costs in high-cost areas

¢ 6,000 extra police recruits, raising police numbers to their highest ever
level, with strong local leadership and proper rewards for those on the
frontline Investment and reform

Renewing public services: education reform

New Labour believes that schools need a step change in reform to make
quality education open to all.

We plan a radical improvement in secondary schools, building on our
success in primary schools. Our aim is to develop fully the talents of each
child. Our ten-year goal is 50 per cent of young adults entering higher
education.

We will now:

* ensure every secondary school develops a distinctive mission
including the expansion of specialist schools

¢ diversify state schools with new City Academies and more church
schools

¢ direct more money to headteachers, more freedom for successful
schools

¢ reform provision for 11- to 14-year-olds to ensure higher standards in
English, maths, science and information technology

¢ introduce new vocational options from 14 onwards, with expanded
apprenticeship opportunities

* ensure primary schools offer more chance to learn languages, music
and sport, as well as higher standards in the basics

¢ provide a good-quality nursery place for every three-year-old

Renewing public services: NHS reform

New Labour believes that the NHS needs radical reform to fulfil its founding
principle of quality treatment based on need, not ability to pay

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 9 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

The NHS needs radical reform if it is to be designed around the needs of
patients. Investment is vital but not enough. Labour's ten-year goal is a
maximum waiting time of three months as we become a healthier nation
with fast, high-quality treatment, free at the point of use.

We will now:

¢ decentralise power to give local Primary Care Trusts control of 75 per
cent of NHS funding, and cut by two thirds the number of health
authorities

¢ reform the appointments system so that by the end of 2005 every
hospital appointment is booked for the convenience of the patient

¢ cut maximum waiting times by the end of 2005 for outpatient
appointments from six months to three months and inpatients, from 18
to six months

¢ work with the private sector to use spare capacity, where it makes
sense, for NHS patients create a new type of hospital - specially built
surgical units, managed by the NHS or the private sector - to
guarantee shorter waiting times

¢ allow successful NHS hospitals to take over failing ones.

Renewing public services: welfare reform

New Labour believes that rights and responsibilities should be at the centre
of reform of the welfare state - to lift children and pensioners out of poverty,
and help parents balance work and family

We will continue to reform the tax and benefit system to reward work, not
irresponsibility. Our ten-year goals are to achieve full employment in every
region, to halve child poverty and tackle pensioner poverty.

We will now:

* create an integrated Child Credit of cash support for children, built on
the foundation of universal child benefit

¢ establish a new Pension Credit for lower- and middle-income
pensioners

e establish a new ‘Employment First’ interview for people entering the
welfare system, and integrate the Benefits Agency and Employment
Service through major reform

¢ extend and increase paid maternity leave to £100 each week for six
months

¢ introduce paid paternity leave

¢ expand childcare places to provide for 1.6 million children

Renewing public services: criminal justice reform

New Labour believes that crime can only be cut by dealing with the causes
of crime as well as being tough on criminals

We plan the most comprehensive reform of the criminal justice system since

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 10 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

the war - to catch, convict, punish and rehabilitate more of the 100,000
persistent offenders. Our ten-year goal is a modernised criminal justice
system with the burglary rate halved.

We will now:

¢ overhaul sentencing so that persistent offending results in more severe
punishment

¢ reform custodial sentences so that every offender gets punishment and
rehabilitation designed to minimise reoffending

e reform rules of evidence to simplify trials and bring the guilty to
justice

¢ introduce specialist, late-sitting and review courts to reflect crime
patterns and properly monitor offenders

¢ establish a new Criminal Assets Recovery Agency to seize assets of
crime barons and a register of dealers to tackle drugs

¢ introduce a victims bill of rights providing legal rights to
compensation, support and information

1 Prosperity for all

Labour's purpose is to help every family, not just a few, to raise their living
standards and plan ahead with security. We have a ten-year vision: higher
living standards, affordable mortgages and fairer taxes combined with much
greater investment in vital public services.

Economic stability is the foundation. We know the price of boom and bust -
it was paid in the 1980s and 1990s by millions of hard-working families.

Our reforms since 1997 have helped cut interest rates to nearly half the
average under the Conservatives, saving mortgage payers on average £1,200
a year. By 2010, we want Britain to break away from the decades of boom
and bust, as we stick to clear rules for spending and borrowing. We will take
no risks with economic policy, make no compromise on fiscal responsibility.

Stability comes first. But stability is not enough. We need to produce more,
better and to a higher value to raise our earning power and to meet our ten-
year goal of faster productivity growth than our main competitors.

We must make Britain the best place to do business in Europe — a dynamic
economy, founded on skills and knowledge, developing the talent of all our
people, and contributing to sustainable development. That means investment
by private and public sectors in infrastructure and skills, and the right
competitive framework to support enterprise, small and large, manufacturing
and services. Every extra trained, employed worker contributes to a fairer
society, as well as a more prosperous one. With social failure, from school
drop-outs to crime, comes economic failure. Fairness and enterprise go
together. It is up to government to do everything it can to help ensure that no
individual and no community is left behind.

mortgages, fairer taxes and better public services

Our ten-year goals

¢ Fiscal rules consistently met, low inflation, and interest rates as
low as possible, as we deliver long-term economic stability.

¢ Faster productivity growth than our main competitors, as we
achieve rising living standards for all.

Our next steps

¢ Basic skills for 750,000 people

¢ Venture capital funds in every region

¢ £180 billion investment in transport, with 25 local rail and tram
schemes

¢ Raise the minimum wage to £4.20

¢ £1,000 tax cut - the Children's Tax Credit - for parents of newborn
children

The fundamentals - Better off with Labour

The foundation of opportunity and prosperity is economic stability. We
know the risks of promises that cannot be paid for: the Conservatives led
Britain into two deep recessions, double-digit inflation, record
unemployment, 15 per cent interest rates and a doubling of the national debt.

Choice, not chance, has turned things round. Independence for the Bank of
England and long-term fiscal rules have given the UK the most stable and
transparent economic framework in Europe. Britain now has the best
combination of low interest rates, low inflation and low unemployment since
the 1960s.

We are saving nearly £9 billion this year from debt and unemployment, so
84p of every extra pound of public spending goes on national priorities,
compared to 58p under the Conservatives.

So we will pursue a balanced approach on the economy with stability the
foundation, more investment not less and, as affordable, targeted tax cuts on
our priorities.

Our aim is to put more wealth in the hands of more people. That is why we
will keep mortgage rates as low as possible, ensure competition keeps down
household bills, support savings and share ownership, and create a new
Child Trust Fund for every child at bir th to invest for when they reach
adulthood.

There are no guarantees in an integrated world economy. But we showed

during the Asian economic crisis how to steer a course of stability in
turbulent times. We will continue to work at international level to minimise

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM
global economic turbulence, and to protect Britain if it occurs.
Tax and spending

Fiscal responsibility and monetary stability are the foundation of our future
plans. New Labour's inflation target is 2.5 per cent. We will continue to meet
our fiscal rules: over the economic cycle we will borrow only to invest, and
keep net debt at a stable and prudent level.

We are pledged to raise health and education spending for the next three
years at twice the rate of the Conservative years. Labour will double net
public investment. And we are on track to save £1 billion in the costs of
government purchasing by 2003.

Tax policy will be governed by the health of the public finances, the
requirement for public investment, and the needs of families, business and
the environment.

We have rewarded work through the new 10p starting rate of tax and the
Working Families Tax Credit. The basic rate of tax has been cut to 22p. We
will support families through the new Children's Tax Credit, set at up to
£1,000 a year for new parents — the first recognition of the costs of children

in the tax system for 20 years. On average, UK households have benefited by

£590 a year from personal tax and benefit measures introduced since 1997.
During this Parliament, living standards have risen by ten per cent for a
single earner family on average earnings. To help those who work and save,
we will extend the 10p tax band. We will continue to tackle tax avoidance.

We will not raise the basic or top rates of income tax in the next Parliament.
We renew our pledge not to extend VAT to food, children's clothes, books,
newspapers and public transport fares.

Labour rewards work

Labour believes that if you work hard you should be able to support a
family. We will guarantee a minimum family income of £225 for a 35-hour
week; in the next Parliament, an Employment Tax Credit will reward the
work of people on low incomes, whether or not they have children (see 'A
modern welfare state').

The first-ever National Minimum Wage for Britain, bitterly opposed at every
stage by the Conservatives, has been a success in our first term. It fulfils,
after 100 years, a founding ambition of the Labour Party. Up to 1.5 million
people, the majority of them women, have been helped; jobs have not been
lost. The Low Pay Commission, which we will make permanent, has made
clear recommendations for the future. New Labour will raise the minimum
wage to £4.10 this October, and is committed, subject to economic
conditions, to raising it to £4.20 in October 2002.

Nine million people invested in ISAs in their first year. To encourage more
saving, we will maintain the £7,000 contribution limit for the next
Parliament. We will help pensioners: the Pension Credit will match private
saving with government funds, and pensioners will no longer be penalised
because of their thrift (See 'A modern welfare state’). To boost the savings
habit, we will create a new Savings Gateway for people on lower incomes
where their savings will be matched by the government.

The productivity challenge - Staying better off

To raise living standards, our ambition is to raise our productivity faster than
our competitors and to ensure our goods and services are competitive in
world markets.

Labour has four priorities:
1. Investment in skills and innovation
Skills

We are passionate about giving every child the chance of a decent education.
But we are equally determined to offer learning opportunities to adults. Our
ambition is for everyone to have the opportunity to train, in a par tnership of
employers, employees and government, each giving time and/or money to
raise standards of skills in the UK. Our first priority is to help the estimated
seven million adults who lack basic literacy and numeracy skills, with
750,000 people achieving basic skill levels by 2004.

We will:

¢ ensure that job seekers get the benefit of a basic skills test, as well as
incentives and obligations to take courses to tackle literacy and/or
numeracy problems

* set up a network of 6,000 IT learning centres around the country

¢ extend Individual Learning Accounts, which have already been
opened by over a million people

¢ dramatically improve the quality and quantity of prison education

e tackle the financial barriers that prevent adults studying in further
education.

Basic skills are the start; updating skills is relevant for all of us. We have
created the Learning and Skills Council for all post-school learning outside
higher education. Further education colleges have a critical role to play in
the future. We will encourage dedicated colleges for under-19s and specialist
adult provision to meet local skills needs, with half of all colleges to be
recognised as centres of vocational excellence by 2003- 04. The world's first

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 14 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

University for Industry now offers over 400 skills courses. For skill
shortages in information technology, we will open two Technology Institutes
in every region to meet the rising demand for high-level technical skills.

We need a step-change in workplace learning — particularly in small and
medium-sized firms. We are determined to develop a three-way partnership
to bring this about. Current arrangements have secured increased
participation, but not enough. Unions and employers have a key role — but
we also need to motivate individual employees. Where both sides of industry
in a sector agree, we will help set up a statutory framework for training. We
will boost the efforts of trade unions to raise skill levels by giving statutory
backing to union learning representatives and supporting the Union Learning
Fund. Government has a wide-ranging role to play and is seeking to develop
a training tax credit. We will look to business and unions to come forward
with proposals on how they can contribute to meeting the nation's training
goals. Everyone has a responsibility to help deliver a high-skill, high-
productivity economy.

Innovation

Science and technology are the basis of new products and industries, both
vital to productivity growth. Since 1997 extra investment of £1.5 billion over
three years has given science a fresh start, and a new stream of university
funding has helped create new links between scientific breakthroughs and
new products.

Photo Caption: Investing in business... first-class engineering

But we need to invest more to be at the cutting edge of science — in
biotechnology and genome research. We propose an R&D tax credit to
promote business investment in research. We will work for a European
patent system by the end of this year to simplify the process of bringing
ideas to market. The £235 billion a year, and growing, global market for
green technology gives real opportunity to British industry to benefit from a
shift to low carbon technologies. We will continue to encourage the best
scientists to work in the UK, as well as making the most of our science base
in universities (see 'World-class public services’).

2. Supporting British business

Government cannot make a business successful. But government must create
the right framework to help business achieve healthy long-term growth.

Since 1997, corporation tax rates have been cut to their lowest levels ever.
Companies no longer face a perverse incentive to pay out dividends rather
than invest for the future. Reform of capital gains tax has given the
entrepreneur or investor new incentives for investment. We support vital
investment through the tax system — with allowances for high tech as well as
small business investment. The Myners report has identified weaknesses in
our venture capital market, undermining long-term investment and economic

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 15 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

dynamism. We will act on its recommendations, including the abolition of
the minimum funding requirement and reforms to pension fund
management, and review progress in two years.

When people have worked hard, they want their money to go as far as
possible. Competition policy has already helped cut cash-machine charges
and new car prices. We will extend our fair and robust competition regime
by giving more independence to the competition authorities. We will
toughen the laws on rogue traders, unfair terms in contracts, and loan sharks.

In the labour market, minimum standards for people at work offer dignity
and self-esteem. Regulation should be introduced, where it is necessary, in a
light-touch way. We will cut back the red tape associated with regulation,
examine opportunities to put time limits on regulations, deregulate by
secondary legislation, and offer help to small firms.

Over 150,000 small businesses have been set up since 1997. We will develop
the Small Business Service as an advocate for small business in government
and a servant of small businesses around the country. We are committed to
reforming the tax treatment of small business, including VAT, and to seeking
a reduction in payroll burdens. Small business will also benefit from
extending the 10p tax band. We will reform the bankruptcy laws to ensure
second chances for people who go bankrupt through no fault of their own,
and provide funds for new start-ups. We will also promote the development
of entrepreneurship in the school curriculum.

We will modernise company law to promote transparency, reduce burdens on
small business and promote long-term economic success. We welcome the
recommendations of the Co-operative Commission, which also covered the
significant mutual sector, and will examine them with a view to
strengthening these important parts of our economy.

3. Modernising our infrastructure for the information age
Digital nation

The infrastructure of the future includes fast, efficient and affordable
communication — telecommunications, the internet and broadcasting. That
requires the best competitive environment, effective regulation and
continued public and private investment in the technologies of the future.

A ‘digital divide' would hurt business as well as individuals: universal access
is vital to effective markets. We will put all government services on-line by
2005, to improve access to services and spur business on-line. We will work
to ensure that broadband, which allows fast internet access, is accessible in
all parts of the country.

English is the language of the internet. We have the best TV in the world.
The next challenge is to open up the learning opportunities and enjoyment
offered by digital TV and the internet to every household. We are committed
to making the switchover from analogue to digital signals as soon as

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 16 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

conditions for access and cost have been met.

The governance of this fast-changing industry is out of date. We will merge
the five separate regulators into one, to create the world's most competitive
and advanced regulatory system. We believe in the value and necessity of
public service broadcasting and have committed to major funding increases
for the BBC and to supporting a publicly owned Channel 4 and S4C. Ofcom
will ensure a level playing field, benefiting consumers in terms of choice,
price and quality, in particular through promoting competition.

Transport

A strong economy needs good transport. Yet our inheritance was massive
under-investment, with British Rail broken into over a hundred privatised
pieces, and bus services in decline.

Labour's priority is to improve and expand railway and road travel. Our ten-
year Transport Plan, supported by all the key players, matches large
resources with major reform. £180 billion of investment, split between
railways, roads and local transport and delivered in partnership with the
private sector, offers real hope to motorists and passengers alike.

Rail

Passenger numbers have risen by 17 per cent since 1997, and freight
increased by 22 per cent. But recent crises have proved the need for urgent
investment and strong regulation. With Labour, £60 billion will be spent on
upgrading the rail network, with the majority of rolling stock replaced. Five
hundred new carriages are already in use, another 3,000 ordered. We plan to
expand capacity to boost passenger levels by 50 per cent, and freight by
more. Safer train protection systems are now being installed and will be
extended following Lord Cullen's report into rail safety.

The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) has been set up to provide strong,
strategic direction. Train companies will get longer franchises in return for
higher investment and improved services. The SRA will lead the expansion
of the network, using public-private partnerships (PPPs). Railtrack is being
reformed to focus on the operation of existing track and signalling. The Rail
Regulator, with strengthened powers, will ensure the delivery of higher
standards, increased safety and increased investment by the company.

London will benefit from new trains and reduced overcrowding on its
commuter services. We support plans to build a new East-West Cross-rail
tunnel and to extend the East London Line. We have pledged increased,
long-term investment in the Tube to underpin a public-private partnership to
upgrade Tube infrastructure, with operations remaining in the public sector.
Our agreement with the London Mayor and Transport Commissioner offers
the best chance in a generation to upgrade the Tube.

Supertrams will transform transport in our big cities, with 25 new light rail

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 17 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

or tram schemes. Services have been introduced or expanded in Manchester,
Birmingham, Croydon, Sheffield, Nottingham, Tyne and Wear with plans
under way for supertrams in Leeds, Portsmouth and Bristol.

Roads

The Transport Plan allocates £60 billion to road improvement. Motorways
will be upgraded; a hundred new bypasses will reduce accidents and
pollution. But environmentally damaging road schemes have been scrapped;
all new roads must now be strictly appraised for maximum benefits and
minimum environmental damage. Our trunk roads are the safest in Europe
and we aim to reduce serious road casualties by a further 40 per cent over
ten years. £8.4 billion is now being invested in local authority schemes in
England. We have given local authorities the freedom to choose to use
charges to reduce traffic — but we insist they put the money into better
transport services. New road safety schemes will mean more school bus
services and traffic-free Home Zones where people can walk safely, and
children play without danger, to help cut the number of child road deaths and
serious injuries by 50 per cent by 2010.

Road tax is being cut on smaller, cleaner cars and duty reduced on greener
fuels. Tax incentives are creating a cleaner lorr y fleet while the road haulage
industry will benefit from steep reductions in Vehicle Excise Duty to among
the lowest in Europe. We will also ensure that hauliers from overseas pay
their fair share towards the cost of our roads. Smarter driving will be
encouraged by new highway communications technology. We are also
working with the motor industry on safer, more fuel-efficient vehicles.

Buses

Buses are vital to local journeys. With Labour, 25,000 new buses are already
in operation. By 2006, almost the whole national bus fleet will be renewed.
Lower concessionary fares have been introduced for over five million older
and disabled travellers. Park and ride schemes are increasing, and over 100
towns now have bus services linked to train stations, with cut-price fares.
Bus partnerships between local authorities and private bus companies will
improve passenger numbers and service quality. Nationally we will work to
improve inter-city coach services.

Integrated transport

Good transport systems offer choice across transport modes. Transport
Direct — a phone and internet system designed to plan journeys and sell
tickets — will put transport ser vices at people's fingertips. Walking and
cycling will be encouraged in thousands of local transport schemes. Inland
waterways are being revitalised and we will take forward the
recommendations of the enquiry into the Marchioness disaster.

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 18 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

International links are also vital. Plans for aviation and airports over the next
30 years will be produced next year. Merchant ships are returning to the
British flag. We will complete the high-speed Channel Tunnel Rail Link.

Major national infrastructure projects, such as Heathrow Terminal 5, raise
vital issues. We will continue to modernise the planning system and
introduce new fast-track procedures for major projects of national
significance.

Photo Caption: Supertram schemes have eased congestion in Manchester
(above), Birmingham, Croydon, Sheffield and Nottingham, with plans under
way in three more cities

The Post Office and postal services

We are committed to high-quality, universal postal services, and a dynamic
Post Office which can thrive in a world of technological change and
increased competitive pressure. Labour is working with the banks to offer a
new universal banking service. This will allow all benefit and pension
recipients to receive their payments, at no charge, in full at the post office
after the switch to Automated Credit Transfer in 2003. We also intend the
local post office to become an invaluable resource for access to government
information. There will be increased incentives for people to take over and
modernise post offices. Business customers, representing by far the majority
of the Post Office's turnover, want a full range of express, parcels and
logistics services. We have given the Post Office greater commercial
freedom in the public sector. It needs to be able to gain an advantage in the
new postal market and become a leading force in domestic and international
postal services through alliances and joint ventures. We want to help the Post
Office keep up with the best in a fast-changing market.

Energy

Labour is committed to a secure, diverse and sustainable supply of energy at
competitive prices. We have brought full competition to the gas and
electricity markets. Coal and nuclear energy currently play important roles in
ensuring diversity in our sources of electricity generation.

We are putting an obligation on electricity companies to deliver ten per cent
of the UK's electricity from renewable sources by 2010, with a doubling of
combined heat and power. We will consider setting further targets for
renewables, with particular focus on offshore wind, solar and biomass
technologies, supported by a £100 million fund. It will back up the Climate
Change Levy, which includes agreements to improve efficiency in energy-
intensive sectors, and the new Carbon Trust, which will recycle £100 million
to accelerate the take-up of cost-effective, low-carbon technologies. We will
support research into clean coal technology and investigate its commercial
possibilities. We will double the expenditure on energy efficiency. Fuel
poverty blights lives: our aim is that by 2010 no vulnerable household in the
UK need risk ill-health due to a cold home.

BNFL is an important employer and major exporter. The government insists
it maintains the highest health, safety and environmental standards. We are
examining the scope for turning the company into a public-private
partnership.

4. Europe and the wider world

Labour will be engaged and influential, fighting for the British national
interest, as we set out in ‘Britain strong in the world’. We will support British
Trade International, which gives business direct access to UK posts abroad,
and maintain the UK's position as the location of choice within Europe for
multinational business.

Labour's position on the single currency was set out by the Chancellor in
October 1997 and reiterated by the Prime Minister in February 1999. We
have made it clear that, provided the economic conditions are met,
membership of a successful Euro would bring benefits to Britain in terms of
jobs, investment and trade. So, in principle, we are in favour of joining a
successful single currency. But, in practice, the five economic tests we have
set out must be met before the government would recommend entry to the
single currency. An assessment of the tests will be carried out early in the
next Parliament. If the government and Parliament recommend entry, the
British people will have the final say in a referendum.

So the choice is between a Conservative Party which will deny the people of
Britain the chance to join, even if it is in our national interest to do so — and
the Labour Party which says that, if it is in our national economic interest,
the decision should be made by the British people in a referendum.

No one left behind - Helping everyone become better off

Britain is better off than in 1997 — but our ambition is to widen the winners!
circle so more people share in the benefits of economic growth. In 'A modern
welfare state' we set out the route to full employment.

Fair and flexible work

We are proud of our commitment to combine a dynamic economy with fair
standards in the workplace. Labour has put right historic wrongs. Every
employee now has the right to four weeks' paid holiday; trade unions have
the right to recognition where a majority of the workforce want it; part-time
workers have proper rights. Our objective has been to promote fairness
consistent with the competitive position of British business. That will
continue to be our position.

We have reformed the labour market to build a durable and fair basis for
constructive employee relations. As we learn from the reforms, we will keep
their effectiveness under review. We want to strengthen partnership at work,
which can foster employee commitment and help at a time of industrial
change. We have established the Partnership Fund and want to expand it.

Information and consultation need to be appropriate to national traditions,
with timely discussion of problems. When large-scale redundancies are
being considered, there is an especially strong case for consultation. The
government is reviewing the effectiveness of the UK's current arrangements
for information and consultation — works councils in larger firms operating
across Europe as well as consultation on large-scale redundancies. We will
implement the findings of our review in this area. We support conciliation in
the workplace to avoid resort to litigation. We will examine reforms that
promote efficiency and fairness.

Women still suffer an 18 per cent pay gap compared to men. We are
committed to tackling the causes of this inequality. We will work with
employers and employees to develop effective proposals, building on good
practice and the sound business case, in both the private and public sectors.

We will develop career services for all. We aim for a ten per cent cut in death
and major injuries at work by 2010 and will clarify responsibility, improve
enforcement and toughen penalties for offences. We are also committed to
working with managers and employees to reduce the problems of bullying
and violence in the workplace. As a major employer, our ambition is to
improve the quality of work for our employees — helping recruitment and
retention.

Prosperity for every region
Regions

Balanced and sustainable growth depends on every region developing its
capacity to the full. Sitting back and leaving regional problems to the market
is not acceptable. The causes of disparities within and between regions must
be addressed. The new regional economic policy must be based on boosting
regional capacity for innovation, enterprise and skill development,
modernising regional infrastructure and improving university/industry links.
This is why Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) have been set up and
why they now have extra money and new freedoms.

We will work in partnership with local people to ensure that all regions and
communities build on their own strengths. Our task is to anticipate change,
handle restructuring and enable businesses to move into high-skill, high
value-added product markets. Labour's Job Transition Service will provide
an intensive and personalised response to large-scale redundancies, helping
people secure work or acquire new skills. The JTS will focus its work on
new Employment Action Plans drawn up by local economic partners.

Our commitment is to use the £1.2 billion rising to £1.7 billion a year now
pledged to RDAs to promote business start-ups, strengthen links between
business and universities, for example through university innovation centres
and the establishment of a Centre for Manufacturing Excellence in every

region to help firms develop. They will develop venture capital funds to
boost wealth-creating capacity.

The Conservatives are so obsessed with the market and so out of touch with
what goes on beyond Westminster that they even want to scrap RDAs — and
with them the vital jobs, inward investment and prosperity that they bring.

Urban renewal

Eighty per cent of people live in urban and inner-city Britain. We are
ambitious for Britain's urban areas: we want to make them better places to
live and better places to set up a business. The New Deal for Communities,
worth £1.9 billion over three years, and the £900 million Neighbourhood
Renewal Fund (see 'A modern welfare state'), as well as our reforms to local
governance (see 'Strong and safe communities') will drive forward progress.

Labour offers £1 billion of tax cuts over the next five years to increase
capital investment in urban areas, for new businesses and for new housing.
Labour will reform the planning system to speed up decision-making,
promote the most efficient use of land, and strike the right balance of
environmental protection, safer communities and economic growth. We have
put urban renewal at the heart of the planning system and set a target of 60
per cent of new house building to be on brownfield land or provided through
the conversion of existing buildings. Two Millennium Villages have set high
standards in design. We will designate more in other parts of the country and
continue to raise standards of urban design, with a quality mark to tackle
cowboy builders.

Photo Caption: Urban renewal is at the heart of the planning system
Housing

Lower interest rates enable more people to own their own homes. Labour
will make it easier for people buying and selling homes through a new
sellers' pack, through grants for low-income homeowners, and help for key
workers in high-cost areas. We will honour our commitment to tackle
homelessness. We will continue to promote housing choice, with reforms to
leasehold and commonhold law, a licensing scheme for houses in multiple
occupation, and new powers for council tenants. We will develop a modern
basis for land registration to make conveyancing faster and cheaper. We will
also examine the ways in which tenants can be helped to gain an equity stake
in the value of their home.

Labour is committed to reducing by one third the backlog of sub-standard
housing by 2004, with all social housing brought up to a decent standard by
2010. We will seek to reduce the use of costly bed-and-breakfast
accommodation. We propose additional investment of £1.8 billion over the
next three years. Some local authorities will continue to provide high-quality
council housing. We are supporting the transfer of 200,000 dwellings per
year, where tenants agree, to social landlords like housing associations, and

new arms-length council housing companies. We will also help 10,000 key
workers buy their own homes in high-cost areas to tackle recruitment
problems.

Rural Britain

The recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease has caused strain and distress
in rural areas. Labour's priorities have been clear: to eradicate the disease as
quickly and effectively as possible, to compensate those directly affected,
and to protect the wider economy. As the number of new cases falls
significantly, and the clean-up of infected areas gathers pace, we are
committed to help the most affected regions with a recovery plan including
advice on sustainable restocking, organic conversion, and early retirement
and outgoer schemes. We will conduct a scientific review of how to prevent
animal disease outbreaks from occurring in the future, and will introduce
tough rules to back this up. But we must also learn some of the wider
lessons.

Agriculture and fishing

Since the Second World War the economy of rural areas has undergone
massive change. About two per cent of the national workforce are now
employed in agriculture. But the industry is particularly important because
of the links with food production, our landscape and our environment.
Labour's aim is to promote economic renewal with a sustainable future for
farming, strengthened communities and sustainable land use.

Short-term pressures need to be met. Since the early 1990s, sectors of
farming have been hard hit by BSE, the weakness of the Euro and falling
world commodity prices. Labour has provided £1.35 billion in short-term
relief for farmers, including aid for diversification, farm business advice,
better marketing, small slaughterhouses and restructuring of the industry. We
have minimised many regulatory burdens and improved the way food safety,
environmental and animal health regulations are implemented.

But British agriculture will only thrive in the longer term through a further,
radical reorientation of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), away from
distorting Europe-wide production subsidies towards more national
responsibility for domestic farming, environmental and rural development
priorities. CAP reform is now more possible; Labour's engagement with the
EU gives us the best chance of making it happen.

We have begun the process of change with our farming strategy and our
seven-year, £3 billion Rural Development Plans for England, Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. Labour will expand this programme so farming
can become more diverse and responsive to consumers, and produce ina
way that sustains and improves the environment. We have already increased
payments for organic conversion from £0.5 million to £18 million, and will
increase them further.

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 23 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM

We have set up an independent, open and consumer-focused Food Standards
Agency to ensure that all food meets the highest standards. We will argue for
the extension of food labelling, to give consumers more choice. Genetically
modified (GM) foods and crops have caused concern despite stringent safety
checks. There should be high standards of safety — regulation must be strict,
to protect the environment and promote public health and consumer choice —
but we must use science to establish the facts, the opportunities and the risks
before taking final decisions in an open way.

It is also important to reform the Common Fisheries Policy to preserve fish
stocks for the future. In the short term, Labour is providing more than £60
million in structural funds over the next three years to help the industry,
including a new decommissioning scheme while also tackling the problem
of 'quota-hoppers'.

wildlife

Economic renewal

The economic hub of a rural area is often a thriving market town. That is
why Labour is committing an extra £100 million of public and private
funding over the next three years for the renewal of market towns. RDAs
will be charged with renewal of rural as well as urban areas. We will support
village life with rate relief for pubs, garages and shops, as well as farmers
who diversify part of their activity into other enterprises.

Tourism is a vital, growing industry for Britain, with 1.8 million employees,
and links to the museums, arts and heritage that people want to enjoy.
Quality is our platform — which is why we now have a unified grading
scheme for hotels and guest houses in England, and new training and New
Deal opportunities. We will support well-targeted promotion, regional
programmes linked to RDAs, and high-quality information via the internet.
Traditional tourist resorts face special problems, so we have extended the
assisted area map to include many seaside resorts and have negotiated an
extension to the European Union regeneration funding so that seaside towns
throughout the country can start rebuilding their economy.

Rural life

Labour is pledged to a rural services standard to set out specifically what
rural people can expect from 21 public service providers — with annual
auditing and commitments to service improvement. The rural school closure
programme has been ended; 3,000 new, affordable homes a year are on the
way; a £30 million police programme will help cut rural crime; £239 million
over three years has been set aside for rural transport services; and the Post
Office is now obliged to prevent closure of rural post offices except in
unavoidable circumstances, with £270 million to help achieve this and
recruit sub-postmasters.

Labour is determined to protect Britain's landscapes and wildlife. Planning,
transport and energy policy all make a difference. We have also designated
the first new national parks since 1948 and brought consensus to a large
increase in access to open countryside. We will press ahead with an £8
billion programme for water companies to clean up rivers and minimise
damage from waste. The dangers of coastal and inland flooding are now
widely appreciated, and we are committed to investment in preventative
solutions, including more sensitive use of agricultural land. We have
increased the number of protected nature sites. We have also initiated
important steps to improve animal welfare in Britain, and argued
successfully for higher welfare standards for battery hens and pigs across the
EU.

Leadership for the future

Labour is committed to support our countryside and the people who live and
work in it. We are committed to create a new department to lead renewal in
tural areas — a Department for Rural Affairs.

Independent and wide-ranging views are essential to the development of
strategic and long-term policy. We will set up an independent commission to
advise on how we create a sustainable, competitive and diverse farming and
food sector within a thriving rural economy which advances environmental,
health and animal welfare goals.

Coalfield communities

Labour is committed to a ring-fenced £400 million package of help for
Britain's ex-mining communities. This will support local regeneration,
including support for new businesses. We will ensure that compensation due
is paid quickly. We will also honour our commitment to ex-miners. suffering
industrial diseases. We have set aside £4 billion to compensate those men
who suffered from lung disease and vibration white finger after working in
Britain's mining industry and the widows who nursed them.

Britain led the first industrial revolution. Other countries got ahead in the
second industrial revolution. Now our ambition is for Britain to succeed in
the third industrial revolution — enhancing knowledge, speeding up
communication and developing the talents of all the British people.

2. World-class public services

The whole country depends on high-quality public services. We have a ten-
year vision for Britain's public services: record improvement to match record
investment, so they deliver high standards to all the people, all the time,
wherever they live.

Since 1997 there has been investment with reform. Thanks to committed
public servants, we have shown that rapid progress is possible and have
begun to break the fatalism that says public services are always second class.
Now is the time to move for ward. Economic stability makes more
investment possible. Labour will put education and healthcare first. We
promise reform to match. We will decentralise power within a clear
framework of national standards to increase the quality and diversity of
public services and meet the challenge of rising expectations.

In education, we offer step-change in secondary schools to match the vast
improvements in primary schools already achieved. Every school will have a
clear mission, with more teachers, new types of school, new opportunities
for children and education tailored to fufil their potential. By 2010, we want
a majority of Britain's young people entering higher education.

In health, we will recruit 20,000 extra nurses and at least 10,000 extra
doctors. Our ten-year goal is a healthier nation, with fast, high-quality
treatment meeting rising expectations and demographic and technological
challenges. Doctors and nurses will be in the driving seat of reform.

The job of government is also about ensuring that the enjoyment, excitement
and inspiration of arts and sport come alive for everyone. In all our public
services, the key is to devolve and decentralise power to give freedom to
frontline staff who perform well, and to change things where there are
problems. Services need to be highly responsive to the demands of users.
Where the quality is not improving quickly enough, alternative providers
should be brought in. Where private-sector providers can support public
endeavour, we should use them. A 'spirit of enterprise' should apply as much
to public service as to business.

primary schools are to be extended to secondary education

e Every secondary school with a distinct ethos, mission and centre of
excellence

e Recruit an extra 10,000 teachers

¢ More power to frontline staff with budgets for ward sisters and
consultants and 75 per cent of NHS spending controlled by Primary
Care Trusts

e More health service workers — 20,000 more nurses, and at least 10,000
more GPs and consultants

¢ Free access to national museums and galleries

Labour's ambition for public services is simple: we want excellent services
for all. Our challenge is to reverse decades of denigration and under-
investment. The citizen — the patient, the pupil, their needs and aspirations —
must be central. We will work with frontline staff to deliver a revival of our
public services that is every bit as profound as the changes to the private
sector in the 1980s.

In our first term, national action was vital — to tackle crises of funding and
quality. Government must take national responsibility for investment and for
setting a clear national framework. Now we need to move on, empowering
frontline staff. Each service needs the right structure and incentives at local
level — decentralisation of power with strong incentives for high
performance. Frontline staff are advocates for citizens, and ambassadors for
their services. Motivated by an ethos of service, they must be supported to
carry through change.

(The proposals and statistics in this chapter refer to England; reform
programmes for Scotland and Wales are detailed in the Scottish and Welsh
manifestos.)

Education - Labour's number one priority

Education remains Labour's top priority. Excellence for the many, not just
the few is our driving passion. Our goal is to develop education to harness
the individual talents of every pupil.

Since 1997 rising standards have been achieved through major new
investment and significant reforms: 17,000 schools have had vital repairs or
refurbishment; 20,000 schools are now connected to the internet; there are
nearly half a million fewer primary pupils in classes of more than 30; over
150,000 teachers are set to receive a £2,000 pay rise above the usual annual
increase; every school is getting additional grants of up to £110,000 paid
direct; and there are 11,000 more teachers and over 44,000 more support
staff and classroom assistants.

Our partnership with teachers has achieved what OfSTED calls a
‘transformation' in primary school standards, thanks to smaller infant class
sizes and major reform in the teaching of literacy and numeracy skills. Our
task now is to achieve a similar transformation in secondary education,
liberating the particular talent of every child. Our pledge to parents is clear:
children should be on track to achieve their best, or receiving extra expert

help to catch up.
Investment

Money alone cannot guarantee a good education, but extra investment is
indispensable to achieving our ambitions. We pledge a further step-change in
investment in return for a further step-change in standards.

In 1997 Labour promised to increase the share of national income devoted to
education. Over this Parliament, we have increased it from 4.7 per cent to 5
per cent — £540 extra per pupil in real terms — and we are pledged to raise it
to 5.3 per cent by 2003- 04. Investment in buildings and equipment has
trebled. During the next Parliament, we will again increase the share of
national income for education.

Under-fives

The early years of a child's life are vital. That is why we are doubling
investment in early years education. There is now a free nursery place
available for every four-year-old. Our new Foundation Stage provides a
distinct phase of learning appropriate for the early years.

By 2004 every three-year-old will be entitled to a free nursery place in the
private, voluntary or statutory sector. OfSTED will help drive up standards.
Children with special educational needs will have those needs identified
earlier. We will continue to provide services which integrate early years
education with childcare.

Photo Caption: Nursery places available for all three-year-olds by 2004

By 2004 we will have 100 Early Excellence Centres as beacons of good
practice providing care and education for children from 0-5; we will set up
500 Sure Start Centres in disadvantaged areas to support children's early
development; and we will provide an extra 100,000 places offering
wraparound care linked to early education.

Primary schools

Primary school teachers have achieved excellent results. In 1997 barely half
of 11-year-olds were up to standard in English and maths tests. The figures
are now 75 per cent and 72 per cent respectively, well on the way to meeting
our targets of 80 per cent in English and 75 per cent in maths by 2002. The
lowest-scoring Local Education Authorities (LEAs) are now achieving better
results than the national average in 1996.

But Labour will not be satisfied until every child leaves primary school with
the basic skills they need. We are setting targets for an 85 per cent success
rate for 11-year-olds in English and maths, and will provide further intensive
support for teachers to meet them.

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

Primary education without the basics is a betrayal; but every parent rightly
wants far more. We will provide primary pupils with wider opportunities to
learn sports, musical instruments and a foreign language.

Secondary schools

Transforming secondary education is the critical challenge of the next
decade. We reject a return to the 11-plus. The principles of inclusion and
equality of opportunity remain central to our commitment to liberate the
potential of every child. But, on their own, they are not enough to guarantee
high standards.

Standards have risen in the past four years, particularly among pupils in less
advantaged areas. Strong school leadership and better teaching have turned
around 700 failing schools. But the challenge ahead is immense. Too many
pupils fall back and become disillusioned in the first two years of secondary
school. Just half of 16-year-olds currently gain good school-leaving
qualifications, and levels of drop-out remain too high.

The dramatic advances at primary level mean pupils will increasingly arrive
at secondary school demanding the best. We will radically modernise
comprehensive schools.

In future every school must have:
The right leadership

Headteachers must have the freedom and resources necessary to run their
schools effectively. We have improved pay and training for headteachers and
delegated more funding to schools. Where they demonstrate success, we will
fur ther extend their freedom to manage their schools effectively. We will
reduce the regulatory burden on all schools.

High standards in the core curriculum

We will modernise the secondary curriculum to promote higher standards
and better progression from school and college to university or work-based
training. All pupils should reach the age of 14 fully competent in a broad
range of subjects. Effective teaching is the key. We will develop the literacy
and numeracy strategies in secondary schools with the right balance of
targets and flexibility, particularly for pupils not up to standard in the basics.
We will set demanding targets for high achievement by the large majority of
14-year-old pupils in English, maths, science and IT tests — the passport to
future success. We will promote more effective pathways beyond 14,
including high-quality vocational routes that build on the new vocational
GCSEs and A-levels. We will ensure there is an apprenticeship place for
every young person who reaches the required standard.

A mission to achieve

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

We want every secondary school to develop a distinct ethos, mission and
centre of excellence. Specialist schools offer the full national curriculum to
the whole ability range while developing a centre of excellence — and their
rates of improvement outstrip the national average. Having trebled their
number since 1997, we have pledged to expand their numbers to at least
1,500 by 2006, on the way to making specialist status available to all schools
ready for it. We will encourage more church and other faith-sponsored
schools, where parents wish it. We will establish more City Academies, and
promote greater innovation in the supply of new schools with local
consultation. We will allow greater involvement in schools by outside
organisations with a serious contribution to make to raising standards. We
will extend provision for gifted children as we nurture children's special
talents. As part of our reform of the vital further education sector, we will
encourage the development of free-standing sixth-form colleges. Schools
with sixth forms will be guaranteed their funding for pupils in real terms,
provided numbers are maintained. We are committed to expand Educational
Maintenance Allowances so they cover 30 per cent of the country, and build
upon them on the basis of the experience. Pupils will be given greater
opportunities through the promotion of partnerships between schools. We
will build on the partnerships established between the state and private
sectors.

Better infrastructure

We will invest nearly £8 billion in school buildings and equipment over the
next three years, including the construction of 650 new or completely
refurbished schools. IT has enormous potential to raise standards, and it is
vital that every child leaves school able to make use of the new technologies.
Today, nearly all schools are connected to the internet. Labour is committed
to spend £1.8 billion over six years on equipping our schools for the
information age. We will pioneer Curriculum Online to ensure materials are
available to pupils in school and at home. We are committed to continue to
extend access to IT for pupils and teachers, including the possibility of a
national leasing scheme to make top-quality hardware available at very low
prices.

Photo Caption: Getting a head start... every child needs good IT skills
The right support

Good schools also depend on parents and the local community. We will
continue to ensure that headteachers have the powers they need to tackle
disruption and unacceptable behaviour in schools. Local education
authorities will focus on supporting school improvement, especially weak
and failing schools, and delivering services that cannot be provided by
individual schools. We will ensure better training and support for school
governors.

Schools should be used more effectively as assets for the whole community,
including for childcare and community learning. We will pilot 'extended

hours schools' to develop this resource. We will build on the success of more
than 40 study centres based in leading football clubs by extending
community involvement to other sports. Over time we want to develop safe
places for children to play outside school hours and every pupil to have
access to a summer school programme. An Academy for Talented Youth will
be established in partnership with a leading university to pioneer summer
and other dedicated provision for those with special talents. We have
significantly improved support and provision for children with special needs
or disabilities. They should have access to the best possible education, with
appropriate support, whether mainstream or special schooling most suits
their needs.

Photo Caption: Improved provision for gifted children as Labour nurtures
special talents

Schools in the toughest areas, and the teachers who work in them, need
special support. We will expand the Excellence in Cities programme for
urban secondary schools, with extra help for the weakest schools, learning
mentors and in-school units to help manage pupil behaviour. Where LEAs
cannot effectively support school improvement, alternative provision will be
made. For schools facing exceptional pressures, for example very high pupil
turnover, we will provide additional support, including significant reductions
in the size of teaching groups where appropriate.

Teachers

Nothing in education is more important than having good teachers. We have
made teaching a far more attractive career, through better pay, better
incentives to train including training salaries and loan write-offs, more
recognition and improved support. The General Teaching Council and
National College for School Leadership are both now up and running.

We want teaching to be a career of choice for the best graduates and
attractive to people making career changes. We will continue to invest more
in the profession and improve conditions for teachers. High status, better
salaries and proper professional support are all essential. We are conducting
a strategic review of teacher workload and the right balance between
teaching and administration, central direction and local discretion. We will
build on its findings significantly to improve support for teachers in the
classroom and in administrative tasks, so they can concentrate on their job.
We will:

¢ recruit 10,000 extra teachers and improve the adult:pupil ratio

¢ support teachers in the classroom by employing more adults to help
them

¢ invest in rapid promotion and rewards for classroom excellence

¢ boost recruitment and retention packages for teachers, particularly in
high-cost areas and schools facing exceptional challenges

* create new routes into teaching, including 'train-to-teach' courses
accredited as part of undergraduate degrees and a stronger training
mission for outstanding schools

¢ subsidise new PCs for teachers so that they have direct access to the

Higher education — a world leader

Higher education brings on average 20 per cent higher earnings and a 50 per
cent lower chance of unemployment. It is time for an historic commitment to
open higher education to half of all young people before they are 30,
combined with increased investment to maintain academic standards.

In 1997 we inherited a system where the number of qualified people able to
go to university was capped. Today, the numbers are rising and universities
have the funds to expand, with new two-year foundation degrees to offer
students the option of a vocationally relevant, high-quality qualification as a
way into skilled work or further study. Over the next three years, we will
continue to expand student numbers, taking us towards our 50 per cent
target.

We will maintain university entry standards while intensifying efforts to
extend the huge advantages that a university education confers to able young
people from all backgrounds. University summer schools, master classes and
mentoring support will be offered to potential students from disadvantaged
areas through a new Excellence Challenge programme, backed up by £190
million of funding.

We will not introduce 'top-up' fees and have legislated to prevent them.
Since 1997 we have increased university funding by more than a billion
pounds a year over the Parliament — and invested considerably more in
research. Our new system of university finance ensures that 50 per cent of
students pay no tuition fees at all, that no parents pay more than under the
old system, and that students pay back loans progressively when they are
earning. We will ensure that the funding system continues to promote access
and excellence.

We will strengthen research and teaching excellence. It is vital that our
world-leading universities are able to compete with the best internationally.
We will also support world-class research and the development of public-
private partnerships. We are determined to ensure that our universities have
the freedom and incentives to meet our ambitions for them. Reforms to the
inspection system for teaching will slash red tape for higher performing
departments.

Health - Quality services from a growing NHS

For over 50 years the NHS has been part and parcel of what it means to be
British. If you fall ill, the NHS is there. Its foundations — tax-based funding
and care according to need — remain as valid today as ever.

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 32 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

The NHS employs one million dedicated people. But it needs far-reaching
reform to redesign its services around the needs of patients. Labour's ten-
year NHS Plan is our strategy for ensuring fast, convenient, high-quality
care in all parts of the country. We will implement it through the next
Parliament and, if elected, beyond. Reform will be driven through primary
care trusts (PCTs) as power and resources are decentralised to frontline staff.

In 1997, waiting lists were at record levels and rising, hospital building had
ground to a halt, and the number of nurses working in the NHS had fallen.
Today, waiting lists are down by over 100,000 and waiting times are falling.
There are 17,000 more nurses, over 6,500 more doctors, and over 9,000
more therapists, scientists and technicians working for patients. The biggest-
ever hospital building programme is under way. NHS Direct, the 24-hour
nurse helpline, is available across the country. Eye tests for people who are
60 and over are now free.

But there is a lot more to do. We are committed to investment and reform.

With Labour, in just four years the NHS will have grown by a third.
Spending on the health service is now rising by an average of over six per
cent a year in real terms — the biggest sustained increase in its history and
double that under the Conservatives. Provided that as a country we maintain
economic stability, we will, if elected, be able to sustain significant funding
increases throughout the next Parliament. So over time we will bring UK
health spending up to the EU average.

The fundamentals of care

That money will help us get the basics right. By 2005 there will be 10,000
more doctors and 20,000 more nurses, with ward sisters in charge of ward
budgets. Matrons will make sure that hospital food is good and wards are
clean, with power to stop payments to contractors who fail to keep hospitals
up to scratch. 'Nightingale' wards for older people and mixed sex wards will
be abolished, and mental health wards will be modernised. There will be
7,000 extra beds in hospitals and in intermediate care. And we will build 100
new hospital developments by 2010 and 500 one-stop primary care centres,
with over 3,000 GP premises modernised by 2004. We are investing an extra
£7 billion of capital investment into the health service. We have said that
Private Finance Initiative (PFD) should not be delivered at the expense of the
pay and conditions of the staff employed in these schemes. We will seek
ways in which, within the framework of PFI management, support staff
could remain part of the NHS team.

Improving health

Our job is not just to improve the nation's health service. It is to improve the

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 33 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

nation's health. Deaths from cancer and heart disease are too high. There has
been a growing health gap between rich and poor. Beyond other
commitments to combat child poverty and poor housing, we will tackle the
long-standing causes of ill-health and health inequality by:

e making the fight against cancer, heart disease and stroke the top
priority for investment and reform, with earmarked extra funding of
£1 billion by 2004. The number of cardiologists will increase by
around half and cancer specialists by nearly a third by 2005 compared
to 1999-2000. Waiting times for cancer treatment will be cut. Our
ambition is to prevent 300,000 avoidable deaths over the next decade

¢ tough targets to close the health gap to cut deaths in poorer
communities and among poorer children improving mental health
services, and a new emphasis on prevention, with more screening
services including for conditions like sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis
and newborn hearing problems

¢ offering the world's best smoking cessation services to help the seven
in ten smokers who say they want to give up

¢ giving children aged four to six in nursery and primary schools a free
piece of fruit every school day — the biggest boost to child nutrition
since free school milk was introduced in 1946.

We remain committed to our bill — blocked by the Tories — to ban tobacco
advertising and sponsorship.

Reforming the NHS

The NHS has to earn the confidence of each new generation. It has to change
the way it works if it is to meet today's challenges and provide fast and
modern services. With Labour, by 2004 patients will be able to see a GP
within 48 hours. By the end of 2005 we will cut maximum waiting times for
outpatient appointments from six months to three months, and for inpatients
from 18 months to six months by expanding staff numbers and reforming
how care is delivered. Major conditions like cancer and heart disease will
have priority, with all patients treated according to clinical urgency.

We will give patients more choice. We have restored the right of family
doctors to refer patients to the hospital that is right for them. Now we will
redesign the system around the needs of patients. Same day tests and
diagnosis will become the norm. By extending the use of NHS Direct and
increasing the numbers of dentists, patients will get easier access to NHS
dentistry wherever they live. Specially built surgical units —- managed by the
NHS or the private sector — will guarantee shorter waiting times. We will use
spare capacity in private-sector hospitals, treating NHS patients free of
charge, where high standards and value for money are guaranteed. It would
be wrong to push people into paying for their operations. That is why we
reject the approach of the Conservatives, which would lead to this outcome.

By the end of 2005 every hospital appointment will be booked for the
convenience of the patient, making it easier for patients and their GP to
choose the hospital and consultant that best suits their needs. From next year,

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 34 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

if an operation is cancelled on the day of surgery for non-clinical reasons,
the hospital will have to offer another binding date within 28 days, or fund
the patient's treatment at the time and hospital of the patient's choice.

By modernising all maternity units, increasing the number of midwives and
giving women greater choice over childbirth, we will ensure that women
receive the highest quality maternity care. There will be tough new standards
for care of children, the elderly and people with conditions like diabetes,
kidney failure, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy.

We will further tackle the ‘lottery of care' as we direct local health authorities
and trusts to fund drugs and treatments recommended by the National
Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE). Genetic services will be extended
in the NHS so that more patients enjoy the benefit of the latest advances in
testing and treatment; but we will ban by law human cloning, and implement
a moratorium on the use of genetic tests for insurance, following a
recommendation of the Human Genetics Commission. We will continue to
examine demographic and technological challenges as they affect the NHS.

Patients will have more say, as in the NHS Plan. We will give every citizen a
personal smartcard containing key medical data giving access to their
medical records. Older people, people with disabilities and their carers will
be able to decide which services they want, with the choice of having cash
given to them directly by local councils.

Patients will be represented on trust boards and have more information on
local services' quality.

Power devolved

To achieve this vision there will be clear national standards but greater
decentralisation to front-line services and to the staff who run them. Locally
agreed personal medical services schemes will be extended. By 2004 all
local healthcare will be organised by primary care trusts (PCTs) run by
frontline doctors and nurses. Together with the new care trusts, combining
health and social services, PCTs will control 75 per cent of NHS funding.
With more power for PCTs we will cut the number of health authorities by
two-thirds and devolve to the remainder the functions of NHS Regional
Offices. We will use the savings of £100 million a year for investment in
frontline services. Hospitals and other local services will have greater
control over their own affairs and access to a £500 million performance
fund, while consistently failing NHS hospitals will be taken over by
successful NHS hospitals.

Appointments to trust boards will no longer be made by ministers but by an
independent panel.

NHS staff

None of these ambitions will be possible without major investment in the

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 35 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

skill, working conditions and working practices of all NHS staff. There will
be extra pay too in high-cost areas, with pressure relieved through expanded
staff numbers, reformed working practices and investment in training.

Every NHS employer will offer more flexible working hours for staff and
especially nurses. Childcare provision will be improved and we will offer
targeted subsidies for childcare for NHS staff. The pay system will be
reformed to make it fairer. As set out in the NHS Plan, there will be new
contracts for GPs and hospital consultants, coupled to extra money. We will
examine the case for a public-private partnership with a commercial
mortgage lender to make home ownership more affordable for nurses and
other staff. We will set up a University of the NHS to guarantee to staff at all
levels opportunities for training and career development. Healthcare
assistants, porters, cooks and cleaners will be offered an individual learning
account worth £300 a year to develop their careers. We will examine the
potential for sabbaticals to help GPs, consultant nurses and consultants keep
their skills up to date.

There will be new systems to learn from when things go wrong, a core
education curriculum for all health professionals and reforms to modernise
the way health professions are regulated. We will take action to protect NHS
staff from violence and abuse, and reform the clinical negligence system.

This is a vision worth fighting for. It will take time to achieve, but this is the
most comprehensive plan ever put before the British people to improve the
state of the nation's health and our health service. It will deliver an NHS to
be proud of.

Culture and sport

The arts and sports are key to our quality of life. They matter for their own
sake. Millions make their living out of their creativity. Government can and
must make sure the opportunities are there. But, for the last 20 years, under-
investment, misplaced priorities, and lack of organisation held back access
and excellence.

Since 1997 this has begun to change. We have started to invest and to reform
the system. Investment in theatre develops the film and television stars of
tomorrow; investment in sport will produce the Olympic and Paralympic
medal winners of 2012.

Culture and sport should not be seen as peripheral issues — they are vital to
our identity and enjoyment as a country. We are pledged to the investment

necessary to expand access and excellence together in culture and sport,
building on excellence in film and broadcasting.

Sport

The performance of British athletes at the Sydney Olympics and
Paralympics thrilled everyone. Labour is committed to a radical extension of

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 36 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

sporting opportunities and facilities. Sport is a good health policy, a good
crime reduction policy, a good way of building communities.

We pledge a sports entitlement for all children, giving them access to at least
two hours a week of sport in or after school. Thanks to our ban on the
enforced sale of playing fields and a commitment of nearly £1 billion to new
sports facilities and 1,000 school sports co-ordinators, all children will be
offered coaching and competitive games. Children with talent need more
investment: we have pledged to fund 200 specialist sports colleges. We will
maintain the elite funding we put in place for individual athletics, with a
first-class athletics stadium for the World Athletics Championships in 2005
and a new stadium in Manchester for next year's Commonwealth Games.

Photo Caption: Sporting chance... Labour is committed to a sports
entitlement for all children

We are committed to sell the Tote to a racing trust to allow it to compete
commercially, with all long-term profits invested in the sport. We are
committed to finding ways to support the amateur sports clubs to which 5.6
million people now belong.

The House of Commons elected in 1997 made clear its wish to ban fox-
hunting. The House of Lords took a different view (and reform has been
blocked). Such issues are rightly a matter for a free vote and we will give the
new House of Commons an early opportunity to express its view. We will
then enable Parliament to reach a conclusion on this issue. If the issue
continues to be blocked we will look at how the disagreement can be
resolved. We have no intention whatsoever of placing restrictions on the
sports of angling and shooting.

Arts

Thirty million people enjoy arts activities each year. The arts are crucial to
national life, with a huge importance for the creative and tourist industries.
Yet the Conservatives introduced charges for our national museums and
galleries, cut the arts budget, and reduced support for ar ts education.

Since 1997 that has changed. National museums are already free for children
and pensioners. Labour is committed to reform the VAT system to ensure
they will be made free for everyone from December. By 2004, arts funding
will be 60 per cent above its 1997 level in real terms. An extra £25 million a
year will go to regional theatre, increasing the number and quality of
productions for audiences in England. We have invested in our orchestras,
and put an extra £10 million a year into developing our regional museums
and galleries. We have maintained our commitment to the nation's heritage
and to its historic buildings, and we will continue our drive to put
architectural quality at the heart of the design of new public buildings.

Education is the bedrock of an artistic society. We are once again giving
children the opportunity to learn music, and we will ensure the opportunity

is available to all. New creative partnerships — linking schools with artists

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 37 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

and arts organisations particularly in disadvantaged areas — will offer
children the chance to develop artistic and creative talents. We will build on
the pilot projects. We have made the largest-ever investment in
computerising libraries; all will be on-line by 2002, with guaranteed
standards to meet users' needs.

From 2002, Culture On-line will offer children and adults alike tailored
access to our national collections and cultural activity over the internet. We
will create new specialist arts schools and city academies to offer specialist
education to the most talented young people.

Public money devoted to the arts should be spent on excellent art, not
bureaucracy. The Arts Council is undergoing substantial reform — creating a
simpler structure which gives more power to the regions, cuts bureaucratic
costs further, and which can deliver a better service to individual ar tists and
arts organisations. We will ensure that our arts funding system backs
excellence, giving artists and arts organisations the long-term stability they
need to become world leaders.

Photo Caption: Cultural heritage...an extra £10 million a year has been
allotted to regional galleries, such as the Lowry in Salford

Creative industries

The creative industries are a vital engine of our economy, providing jobs for
over one million people. The National Endowment for Science, Technology
and the Arts (NESTA) has been set up to back our most talented young
people.

Creative entrepreneurs need seed funding, cheap accommodation near other
similar companies, and advice on how to develop their talent into a business.
To meet those needs, we now plan to provide start-up advice, services and
funding for new businesses. Venture capital will be available through RDAs,
and a creative industries champion will be appointed in every Business Link.

Lottery

Under the Conservatives, many communities missed out on their fair share
of lottery money. The number of grants to community groups has trebled
with Labour. Yet there are still communities which have received a
disproportionately small share of lottery funding. We will ensure a fairer
deal for them.

Labour has reshaped the lottery to match people's priorities. Money goes for
revenue as well as capital. The New Opportunities Fund (NOF) directs help
to education, health and the environment — after-school clubs, vital cancer-
beating equipment, local green spaces. We backed going ahead with the
Dome as an opportunity to showcase British talent and give people a good
day out in millennium year.

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 38 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

Despite being enjoyed by more than six million visitors, the Dome did not
fulfil expectations and we have learned the lessons, good and bad, from it.
But the development of the Dome has been the catalyst for unlocking the
value of the North Greenwich peninsula and regenerating local communities.

We need a revolution in the status, standards and focus of our public
services. Labour is prepared to make the investment in staff and services —
and we are ready to match investment with reform.

How Labour helps young people:

¢ by raising standards and investing more in education, from nursery
schools to adult learning

¢ by giving the majority of young adults the opportunity to study in
higher education

¢ by tackling youth unemployment, with the New Deal made permanent

¢ by opportunities to train as you work, through modern apprenticeships
and the right to time off to study

¢ by expanding sports facilities in schools and in the community

¢ by cleaning up the environment, with support for green technologies
and global action to tackle climate change

A Modern Welfare State

As society changes, so the welfare state must change. We have a ten-year
vision for an active welfare state: to promote work for those who can,
security for those who cannot, and rewards for those who save, volunteer,
learn or train.

Since 1997, we have cut the costs of unemployment, saving £4 billion last
year. As a result, we have been able to spend more on tackling poverty and
raising family support within a social security budget that has grown, in
Labour's first term, at the lowest rate since 1948.

Employment is not just the foundation of affordable welfare, it is the best
anti-poverty, anti-crime and pro-family policy yet invented. After years of
mass unemployment, full employment is now on the agenda. Our ten-year
goal is to sustain a higher percentage of people in work than ever before.
With more than one million more people in work than in 1997, and a million
vacancies in the economy, we need to extend the New Deal, not abolish it as
the Conservatives propose.

We judge our society by how we treat the young and the old. In this
Parliament, over one million children have been taken out of poverty; our
ten-year goal is to halve child poverty, ending it in a generation. We will
transform support for children to achieve it.

For those in retirement, security depends on partnership between state and
funded provision. We promise that, within two years, no pensioner need live

on less than £100 per week, increased annually in line with earnings growth.

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 39 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

On top of that, we will reward pensioners who save.

Government cannot achieve social inclusion for people, but it can help them
achieve it for themselves, by transferring power and opportunity to local
communities. That is our promise.

Photo Caption: Employment for all is Labour's goal, with help for young
people from the New Deal

Our ten-year goals

Sustain a higher percentage of people in work than ever before, as we
seek full employment in every region.

Child poverty halved and pensioner poverty tackled, as we extend
opportunity for all children and security for all pensioners.

Our next steps

¢ An 'Employment First' interview for everyone coming on to
benefits

¢ Expanded support for children through tax and benefit reform

e Extend and increase paid maternity leave and introduce paid
paternity leave

e New pension credit for lower- and middle-income pensioners, and
the Winter Fuel Payment retained

e £900 million Neighbourhood Renewal Fund for jobs, education
and crime prevention

Full employment - Labour's goal

With Labour, the welfare state helps people into work, makes work pay,
supports them at work, and demands responsibilities in return. Our ambition
is full employment in every region good for the economy and good for social
justice.

The New Deal has already helped to cut long-term youth unemployment by
75 per cent 280,000 young people have been helped into work. Long-term
unemployment is down by over 60 per cent. The claimant count is the lowest
for 25 years.

But too many people are still denied the opportunity to work. A million
people remain unemployed; 100,000 lone parents have come off income
support since 1997, but our target is to raise the current 50 per cent
employment rate to 70 per cent. Many people with disabilities out of work
say they would like to work. Older people, with a wealth of talent and
experience, are a resource we cannot afford to waste.

Labour has ended the days of low-grade job schemes. The New Deal leads
to real jobs, a lower benefits bill and higher tax receipts. We now need to

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 40 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

build on its success, extending it to more people across the country.

We also need to ensure that the barriers to work are pulled down by
delivering on our obligation to tackle discrimination so that all people can
make the most of their talents.

Making the New Deal a permanent deal

The benefits system we inherited was fragmented, complex and
contradictory. We are putting in place clear, consistent rules: those who can
work should be in work or in contact with the labour market. As
unemployment falls, we need further reform to help people into work.
Labour will introduce a new principle of ‘employment first’, with rights and
responsibilities balanced at every stage. The contract is simple: quality
opportunities for real responsibility. ‘Something for something’ is the
foundation.

Labour is pledged to create a new Working Age Agency, JobCentre Plus,
merging the old Employment Service and Benefits Agency, and focusing on
the key skill needs of areas of the country and sectors of the economy.
Whoever you are, wherever you live, you will get the opportunities suited to
your needs from one office, one adviser, one system.

The New Deals for young people and older workers will focus on numeracy,
literacy, IT skills and presentation. Where people are homeless or suffer drug
or mental health problems we will offer specialist support. More than
140,000 adults aged over 25 have been unemployed for over 18 months.
Labour will deliver more intensive and flexible help, with increased
responsibilities for claimants.

Photo Caption: Skills for life a young catering student works towards a
vocational qualification

We will offer greater flexibility to personal advisers and encourage greater
engagement of employers, with IT training for all New Dealers.
Employment Zones include funding geared to results and public-private
partnership. On the basis of the evidence we will consider their extension to
new areas and new claimant groups. We will build on the Action Teams for
Jobs model, which is targeting 40 of the most severely disadvantaged areas,
to tackle the employment gap for ethnic minorities, and devote £45 million
to provide stepping stones into employment for the hardest to employ.

All lone parents will be invited to employment interviews to help them seek
employment opportunities. We will build on the lessons of the Choices
programme, which offers help with learning, work and childcare. Partners of
unemployed people with children, like those without children, will also be
asked to interviews to discuss their options.

Parents need good-quality and affordable childcare if they are to have real
choice about work. For the first time, Britain has a National Childcare
Strategy covering cost, provision and quality. We have already created

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 41 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

300,000 extra childcare places. By 2004 our target is to have childcare
places for 1.6 million children. Our vision is ambitious: safe and reliable
childcare nationwide, allowing all parents to combine home and work,
confident in the childcare they have chosen. We will help with the costs of
childcare through the Childcare Tax Credit and will look to extend it to
people looking after children with disabilities, and shift workers. We will
support the commitment of community and voluntary groups to build up a
diverse range of childcare from Early Excellence Centres to neighbourhood
nurseries and informal care (see 'World-class public services’).

Many older workers now want to continue in work full- or part-time. Yet one
in three people between 50 and state pension age is not working. To help
them we will build on the New Deal 50+. To help bridge the divide between
work and retirement, we will examine ways to ensure that people will be
able to draw on their occupational pension and continue to work part-time
for the same employer, phasing their retirement without compromising their
pension. We are exploring how to facilitate the transition from work to
positive voluntary activity.

Our ambition of full employment is part of a deal: if you put in a fair day's
work, the government will ensure you are able to support yourself and your
family. The minimum wage is the foundation. But we offer a guarantee of
take-home pay too. For people with families, we promise to match your
effort with support through the tax system. For those on low incomes
without children we will create an Employment Tax Credit to boost their
earnings, tackle poverty and improve work incentives.

People with disabilities

Our ambition is to enable people with disabilities to play a full part in the
community. The Disability Rights Commission now ensures full civil rights
for people with disabilities; we have legislated so those with special needs or
disabilities have equal access to education. We are now committed to
extending basic rights and opportunities, as indicated in our response to the
Disability Rights Taskforce.

We are requiring different kinds of public transport to be made accessible,
and introducing concessionary bus fares for the first time, for people with
disabilities.

The New Deal for Disabled People pioneers new ways of helping people
with disabilities into jobs. The opportunity to work is vital to civil rights; we
are testing how best to offer help with rehabilitation and job retention. We
will invest an additional £40 million to help people with disabilities into
work, ensure that it is worthwhile to try out a job and stay in work if they
have high care costs, and improve assessment for equipment and services as
people move in and out of work.

We will not use disability benefits to disguise unemployment the Tory
approach in the 1980s. The number of people getting Incapacity Benefit (IB)
has fallen by 11 per cent since 1997; but too many people are written off

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 42 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

when in fact they could, with support, work.

We will help break down the barriers that keep people with disabilities out of
work. We will continue to modernise the operation of the benefits system so
that, if people can work, we help them to do so, and stop them slipping from
lack of work to inability to work. Around 18 million working days are lost
each year due to work-related illness at a cost of over £17 billion. Many
people on Industrial Injuries Benefit are helped into work by combining
support with effective services, and we want to help as many of the rest as
possible. But if people cannot work society has a duty to provide security for
them.

For people unable to take up paid work, we are committed to offer security.
We have increased support for children with parents on income support by
80 per cent in real terms since 1997. There is now a minimum income
guarantee of £142 per week for people with disabilities under 60. Incapacity
Benefit has been extended to people disabled from a young age. Disability
Living Allowance has been extended to three- and four-year-olds. We will
continue to keep the system under review.

Housing benefit

Although the number of people claiming housing benefit is currently falling,
it remains the main way in which accommodation is made affordable. Our
first priority has been to work with local authorities to drive up
administrative standards and tackle fraud and error. But we must continue to
reform it. So we will simplify housing benefit and its administration,
distinguishing between people of working age and pensioners, reforming
provision for private tenants, and examining the case for longer awards. We
will spread best practice in administration. In the longer term, we will build
on our restructuring of rents to ensure that for people of working age,
housing benefit as well as the Working Families Tax Credit strengthen work
incentives.

Children and families

Strong and stable family life offers the best possible start to children. And
marriage provides a strong foundation for stable relationships. The
government supports marriage. But it has to do more than that. It must
support families, above all families with children. Our vision of the tax and
benefits system for families with children is to provide help for all families;
to give most help at the time families need it most; and to give more help to
those families most in need.

The Conservatives stacked the tax system against families: over four million
children lived in poverty; one in five children were growing up in
households without work; the average income of households with children
had fallen to 30 per cent below the level for those without children.

Labour has started to turn this round. We have raised child benefit for the

first child by over a quarter. The Working Families Tax Credit has meant a
tax cut averaging £31 per week for 1.1 million families. In 2001-02, an
average of nearly £500 above 1997-98 levels will be invested in every child
in Britain. Personal tax and benefit changes have made families with
children an average of £1,000 a year better off.

We are pledged to go further to eradicate child poverty in a generation and
halve it by 2010. In the next Parliament we will make major changes. The
Children's Tax Credit the family tax cut is worth up to £520 a year for five
million families, with half a million families removed from paying tax
altogether. It is paid until one parent earns more than £40,000 per year.

From 2003, the Integrated Child Credit will bring together all existing
income-related payments for children, providing most help to the neediest
children, building on the foundation of universal child benefit. With the new
system of child support, every family will receive at least £15 per week, and
those most in need £50 per week over £2,500 per year. For the first time,
Britain will have a seamless system of child support, whether parents are in
or out of work, paid to the main carer.

Our aim is to make the goal of ending child poverty in Britain a political
litmus test for any political party running for office. The task for the next
Parliament is to help another million children out of poverty.

Assets

Our active welfare state has so far been based on work, finance and services.
It is now time to add a fourth pillar to the welfare state a programme to
extend to all children the advantages that come from reaching adulthood
backed by a financial nest-egg.

Nearly a third of individuals have no financial savings or assets at all. People
without assets are much more likely to have lower earnings and higher
unemployment, and are less likely to start a business or enter higher
education.

The government already encourages people to save for a rainy day and save
for a pension. We are determined to extend the savings habit to more people.
But we are pledged also to use saving to promote opportunity for the next
generation.

All newly born children will have an interest-bearing Child Trust Fund set
up in their name with an initial endowment from the government, with more
for poorer children. The endowment will be locked until the child reaches
adulthood. We will provide incentives for extended family and friends as
well as parents to contribute to the fund. All the next generation will have
the backing of a real financial asset to invest in learning, buying a home or
setting up a business.

Caring for children

A safe childhood is not just about financial security. It is also about care for
children, especially the 58,000 children in care. Society is failing these
children: 70 per cent leave school without any GCSEs and too many have
been abused while in care.

Labour supports a national children's rights director to act as a champion for
children in need and we will consult on whether to develop and extend the
director's role. The Criminal Records Bureau will help stop paedophiles and
others who are a danger to children from working with them. From next
year, all children's homes will, for the first time, be subject to independent
spot checks. The level of educational attainment of children in care will be
significantly increased. Every child leaving care will be guaranteed access to
a job, training or education.

For many children in care, adoption offers the best chance of success in life.
We will make adoption faster and fairer. Children who need new families
will be placed within 12 months by 2004. We aim to ensure that at least
1,000 more children a year are adopted, with improved post-adoption
support for parents.

Family-friendly working

For the majority of parents, time is precious. Many employers offer excellent
schemes for family-friendly working. But we want to go further with
government funding to help parents devote more time to their children early
in life. We want government to promote choice because, without our help,
many people are denied the choices that should be theirs. A flexible labour
market must work to the benefit of both employers and employees.

Statutory maternity leave is currently 18 weeks; we propose to increase it to
six months. Statutory maternity pay is paid at a flat rate of £60 a week; we
propose to increase it to £100 per week, as big an increase in the next two
years as in the past 40 years. Fathers currently have no legal right to paid
time off on the birth of a child; we propose to introduce it for two weeks,
also paid at £100 per week. We need to do more to help parents balance
work and family. Many parents, especially mothers, want to work reduced
hours when they do go back to work. We will work with business and
employees to combine flexible working with the needs of business.

Child Support Agency

Some families break up. Government's role is to ensure that both parents
retain responsibility for the financial support of their children where they are
able to do so. We have always supported the principle underlying the work
of the Child Support Agency (CSA), but the Conservatives bungled its

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 45 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

introduction. That is why we have already legislated to reform the CSA and
these improvements will come on stream from 2002. A simple system will
ensure a better deal for children, that fathers pay a fair share, that mothers
benefit from their doing so, and that tougher action is taken against parents
who do not comply.

Pensions and pensioners

In 1997 Labour made a clear commitment to ensure pensioners share fairly
in the rising prosperity of the nation. At this election, we repeat our
commitment to pensioners we honour your lifetime of work by ensuring that
you share fairly in the nation's rising prosperity, and are committed to
tackling pensioner poverty. We will build a secure system on the foundation
of the basic state pension.

As a result of Labour's policies, in this Parliament spending on pensioners
will be £4.5 billion a year more in real terms than in 1997. Of this, £2 billion
is going to the poorest third of pensioners.

Our first priority was to help those on lowest incomes: we have lifted the
incomes of the 1.7 million poorest pensioners by at least £800 a year, and for
some couples by up to £1,400. Pensioner households are on average £11 per
week better off than they were in 1997; and over three million pensioner
households benefit from free TV licences for those over-75s.

The pensioners tax allowance means six out of ten pensioners pay no tax.
We have halved the rate of tax they pay on savings income. We have pledged
to extend tax allowances further so that by 2003 no pensioner pays tax until
their income reaches £127 per week.

We now need to go further. With Labour, the basic state pension will rise by
2003 to £77 a week for a single pensioner and £123 a week for a pensioner
couple. We guarantee that the Minimum Income Guarantee will be uprated
each year in line with earnings, throughout the next Parliament. In 2003, this
will mean no single pensioner will have an income below £100 per week and
no pensioner couple an income below £154 per week. Labour introduced the
Winter Fuel Payment. Its level is set each year. Last winter it was raised to
£200. For next winter it will also be £200.

We will also do more to reward pensioners who have saved. Pensioners who
work and save will find, for the first time ever, the government rewarding
their saving. Pensioner couples with an income up to £200 per week and
single pensioners with income up to £135 per week will be rewarded for
saving the government adding up to 60p for each £1 of savings income up to
a maximum of £23. In the process, we will abolish the weekly means test for
pensioners, along with removing the unfair test of savings, which penalises
pensioners who have modest savings and whose thrift should be recognised.

It is also vital to have in place long-term pension reform. We support a fair
balance of public and private provision. Occupational and personal pensions,

properly regulated, will continue to offer security for middle and high

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 46 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

earners. We will continue discussions on annuity reform to ensure tax rules
do not unnecessarily restrict the development of annuity products and
markets. For low- to middle-income earners, stakeholder pensions cap costs,
guarantee value for money, offer flexibility, and drive down fees across the
board. And for the lowest paid and carers, full-time parents and people with
disabilities, the state second pension will top up their pension contributions
to give a decent pension in retirement to 18 million people.

Today's pensioners have much to give to society. Labour's NHS Plan offers
£1.4 billion of investment for older people to promote better health and
support independence. Pensioners also need simple, accessible services that
treat them with dignity and promote independence. We will build on Care
Direct to provide a better integration of health, housing, benefits and social
care for older people. This will be an integrated ‘third age service! to help
older people and those who care for them.

How Labour helps pensioners:

¢ by boosting the basic state pension for a single pensioner to £77 each
week in 2003, £123 for couples

¢ by retaining the Winter Fuel Payment, and free TV licences for over-
75s

¢ by rewarding those who save with the Pension Credit

¢ by raising the Minimum Income Guarantee to £100 each week (£154
for couples) in 2003

¢ by tackling discrimination against over-50s in health care and in the
workplace

¢ by boosting police numbers and cutting overall crime, and crimes like
burglary that affect senior citizens the most

Carers

Not only are the large majority of people who require care older, but also the
majority of carers are older people. Labour will tackle the problems faced by
people requiring care and the problems of carers themselves.

The national carers strategy is the first step, with information, support and
care for carers: Labour will spend £500 million over the next three years
providing financial support for 300,000 carers through the benefits system,
and £255 million for social care services for carers. More is being done for
carers through income support; carers will be better able to combine work
and care; and 75,000 more carers each year are now able to take a break
from their caring responsibilities. We are proud that, with Labour, care by
qualified nurses will be made free to all, wherever it is received. One
hundred and fifty thousand more older people will receive rehabilitation and
convalescence through growing investment in the NHS and social services
that the Tories refuse to match. We want to see carers given access to the
cash and services appropriate to their service to their relatives and the

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

community. The Carers and Disabled Children's Act gives carers a right to
an independent assessment of their needs. We will examine the development
of a fund to help local authorities produce tailored care packages to back up
the results of these assessments.

Social inclusion

Social exclusion, affecting around ten per cent of the population, living in
fewer than 1,000 of the most deprived wards in Britain, damages lives and
wrecks communities. Before 1997, social exclusion was ignored. Now we
have a new approach improving the quality of mainstream services,
preventing people falling between the cracks, and reintegrating them into
society if things go wrong. We have targeted five priorities:

Homelessness

The number of people living on the streets is down by one third since 1997.
Labour's target is to cut rough sleeping to two-thirds of its 1998 level by
2002. Beyond then, we will maintain the drive to keep the number as low as
possible.

Teenage pregnancy rates are falling

Yet Britain has the highest rates in Europe. Labour's strategy tackles the
causes of teenage pregnancy, provides mothers under 18 with access to
supervised housing if they cannot live at home, and ensures that, if they do
have children, teenagers get access to training, education or work. By 2004
we are pledged to reduce teenage pregnancy by 15 per cent.

Truancy and exclusion

Labour has a target of reducing truancy and exclusion by a third by 2002.
The police are conducting truancy sweeps; parents are now subject to fines
of up to £2,500; funds are being targeted towards pupils at risk.

16- to 18-year-olds

Nearly ten per cent of 16- to 18-year-olds are not in education, training or
work. The new Connexions service will bridge the gap, providing a single
adviser to ensure all young people receive clear advice on the transition to
work.

Neighbourhood renewal

Over the next three years Labour is pledged to back reform, with £900
million of investment in deprived neighbourhoods. We want local people to
lead renewal a coalition of public, private and voluntary organisations
specifying priorities, engaging local effort. Local Strategic Partnerships,
which we have introduced to help coordinate public service improvement,

http://labourmanifesto.com/2001/2001-labour-manifesto.shtml Page 48 of 49

2001 Labour Party Manifesto - LABOURMANIFESTO.COM 13/06/2024, 13:28

will be properly inclusive of local people, involving them in decision-
making. They will be backed by specific funds to engage the local
community. Nearly £100 million has been set aside for business start-ups,
and we will create a new tax credit for community investment to create £1
billion of investment in disadvantaged areas.

Britain

Preface
New Labour’s 2005 manifesto applies
the unchanging values of our party to
the new priorities of the British people.
It is a plan to improve the lives of hard-
working families and prepare our
country for success in a fast-changing
world. Our case rests on one idea more
than any other — that it is the duty of
government to provide opportunity and
security for all in a changing world.
Every chapter relates back to that goal:
breaking down the barriers that stop
people fulfilling their talent, extending
opportunity to every corner of the
United""Kingdom, building communities
strong and safe for those who play by
the rules. On the firm foundations we
have laid since 1997, our programme
will embed.a.‘new progressive
consensus in our country.

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

Eight years ago, I offered new leadership — fresh, idealistic,
energetic, but untested. You voted for change and gave me the
chance to serve. In our first term we banished the demons of
ten per cent interest rates, mass unemployment, wages of
£1.50 an hour, and outside toilets in our schools. We put
Labour values into action. And we banished Labour demons
too: we showed we could run the economy well, cut crime, and.
stand up for Britain abroad. We proved our competence.

Four years ago, I said we needed to continue the modernisation of our
economy, coupled with investment and reform to achieve change in
public services. At the end of this second term we have delivered an
unprecedented period of stability and growth, we have increased
investment and we have embarked on a radical programme of reform
to put the people themselves in the driving seat of our public services.
We have made difficult decisions — about health policy, student
finance, and secondary school reform. In the process we have proved
our resilience. Now we go to the people not only having delivered on
our promises, but also setting new and more ambitious goals for our

public services and our country.

But Britain can be better still.

I know the change is possible. Not just because I have studied the sta-
tistics, but because I have seen it with my own eyes, across the length
and breadth of the United Kingdom.

Ihave spoken to NHS staff in Coventry, Edinburgh and Swansea,
who tell me how their new hospital and the new funding is letting them
improve care for their patients.

Ihave heard teachers in Bexley, Middlesbrough and Sheffield tell me
how they no longer have to work in crumbling classrooms without

Preface Tony Blair

books and computers — and pupils show me, with pride, round their
sparkling new school.

Ihave met youngsters in Blackpool and London whose lives have been
transformed by the New Deal — once written off, they are now full of
confidence and ambition.

Pve been to communities in Southampton and Darlington where the
Sure Start programme is helping overcome disadvantage and seen for
myself the remarkable revival of our great cities.

I have met aid workers in Africa who tell me how this country is
improving the lives of the poorest on our planet.

These are not the fantasy of politicians. They are the stories of real life
in our country and abroad. Not for everyone. Not everywhere. But for
enough people and in enough places for us to know it is not a fluke.
Personal prosperity and the good society; the fruit of partnership
between the British people and a government on their side.

Now we have to decide whether to go forward or back.

Britain is on the right track. We will not change direction. Neither will
we rest on our laurels. Our third-term opportunity is to build on the
progress we have made. That progress, first as a party then in govern-
ment began with the insight that the only way to advance decent
progressive values was to develop a new policy agenda. Our under-
standing of the world and the great changes underway in our society
led us to reject the false choices of the past. This is the foundation stone
of new Labour.

I believe that in our third term we can embed a new progressive con-
sensus. One that reflects the mission of our movement, and the hopes

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

and values of our people. And as much as the pursuit of this consensus
represents an unprecedented opportunity for progressive politics, so it
will be bitterly opposed by those who seek to take us back to the divi-
sions of the past.

In our third term we will forge an even stronger bond between the
goals of economic progress and social justice. No going back to fiscal
irresponsibility. No going back to a Conservative government that says
mass unemployment is a price worth paying. Going forward instead
to an opportunity economy, spreading prosperity through high
employment and welfare reform, spreading opportunity through
widening access to university and training, spreading ownership
through the Child Trust Fund and expanding homeownership.

In our third term we will make public services safe for a generation.
No going back to one-size-fits-all monolithic services. No going back
to the Tory years of cuts and privatisation. Going forward instead to
services free to all, personal to each: breaking once and for all the drop-
out culture in education and the waiting-list culture in health, by rais-
ing investment and driving innovation through diversity of provision
and power in the hands of the patient, the parent and the citizen.

In our third term we will cement a new social contract with rights
matched by responsibilities. No going back to ‘no such thing as socie-
ty’. Going forward instead to power and resources in the hands of the
law-abiding majority. A government committed both to abolishing
child poverty and to putting the values of individual responsibility and
duty at the very heart of policy.

In our third term we will show that our national interest can only be
pursued by engaging with the world’s great challenges. No going back
to a Britain marginalised and weak. Going forward to a stronger coun-
try in a safer, fairer world. Leading on Africa, leading on the

Preface Tony Blair

environment, at the heart of Europe, working together to tackle terror
and spread peace and justice.

We do not duck the tough choices — from independence for the Bank
of England to the tax rise we made for the NHS, to the war in Iraq. We
made decisions because we believed them right — not because they
were destined to be popular.

But we refuse to accept false choices. The British people never wanted
to choose between wealth creation and social justice. They never want-
ed to choose between national security and overseas aid. They never
wanted to choose between equal rights and protection from crime.
These are the false choices that landed us with economic decline and
social division.

The British people have the capacity to make this a great country. Our
ideals are undimmed: extend opportunity to all, demand responsibili-
ty from all, secure justice for all. Our policies are refreshed: never has a
governing party proposed a more wide-ranging programme of change
for the country. Our vision is clear: a country more equal in its oppor-
tunities, more secure in its communities, more confident in its future.
Itis our social contract: we help you, you help yourself; you benefit and
the country benefits.

So now, I fight my last election as Leader of my party and Prime
Minister of our country. My call is a passionate one: let’s togeth-
er make irreversible the positive changes that are happening in
our country. Let’s make the values of social justice and a fair deal
for all the governing ideal of our country not just for some time
but for all time. People freed from barriers of class, building a
better future for themselves and for the country. Self-interest
and national interest together.

New Labour’s record:
The contract delivered

Our country is changing for
the better, because we fulfilled
the promises of our 1997 and
2001 manifestos. Here is what
has changed.

 

10

Britain forward not back

Prosperity for all
Britain now has a stable, growing economy with the lowest inflation
since the 1960s.

Since 1997, two million more people are in work, and the UK has the
lowest unemployment for 30 years. Tax credits and the minimum wage
are ensuring that work pays for everyone.

Because of this we are saving £5 billion a year on the costs of unem-
ployment — that’s £84 for every citizen in Britain — money that is being
invested in frontline services such as schools and hospitals.

There are over one million more homeowners, saving on average near-
ly £4,000 a year, thanks to the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years.

Since 1997, average incomes have increased by 19 per cent and the
income of a typical family has increased by 17 per cent, with living stan-
dards rising in double digits for every part of the income spectrum.

There are 300,000 more businesses, providing jobs and increased
prosperity.

There are two million fewer children and nearly two million fewer
pensioners living in absolute poverty.

® World-class public services

Investment in public services is up — an extra £1,000 per pupil per
year in real terms since 1997, and spending on the NHS has more
than doubled to £69 billion. There are over 28,000 more teachers and
105,000 extra teaching assistants and support staff. The National
Health Service now has 79,000 more nurses and over 27,000 more
doctors. And public servants — from nurses to police officers — are bet-
ter rewarded for their work.

11

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

Our ten-year-old pupils are ranked third best in the world in literacy
and are the fastest improving in numeracy.

Since the introduction of free entry, visits to our national museums
and galleries have risen by 75 per cent.

Deaths from heart disease are down by 27 per cent and cancer deaths
are down by 12 per cent.

@ A modern welfare state

Thanks to our New Deal, long-term youth unemployment has been
virtually eradicated, with over half a million young people helped
into work.

By October 2005, families with children will be on average £1,400 a
year better off as a result of our tax and benefit measures compared to
1997.

‘Thanks to our reforms pensioner households are on average £1,500 a
year better off, rising to £2,000 for the poorest third.

Maternity leave has increased to 26 weeks and maternity pay has
almost doubled.

There are 1.2 million more older people in employment. The employ-
ment rate for people aged between 50 and pension age has increased
by over five percentage points to 70 per cent.

@ Strong and safe communities

Crime has fallen by 30 per cent overall, with almost five million fewer
crimes a year than in 1997.

12

New Labour's record: The contract delivered

There are record numbers of police, nearly 13,000 more, assisted by
4,600 new Community Support Officers.

New powers to tackle anti-social behaviour have been introduced, with
nearly 4,000 Anti-Social Behaviour Orders issued so far and nearly
66,000 fixed penalty notices.

We have halved the time from arrest to sentencing for persistent
young offenders.

More than 80 per cent of initial decisions on asylum claims are now
processed in two months.

@ Britain strong in the world
Britain’s interests are at the heart of an enlarged European Union, with
economic reform putting jobs first.

Our international aid budget for the world’s poorest countries has
more than doubled.

We have successfully pressed for the restarting of world trade talks
which will focus on the needs of developing countries.

Our strong, effective and responsive armed forces are ensuring the
defence of Britain’s interests.

We introduced greenhouse-gas trading to cut pollution — the first

country to do so — reducing emissions by 9.8 million tonnes in the first

two years.

Britain forward not back

Labour’s economic record is unprecedented — the highest
employment ever, longest period of uninterrupted growth in
modern history, lowest sustained interest and inflation rates
for a generation. Our economic policies will build on the plat-
form of stability and growth in three ways: entrenching a low-
debt/high-employment economy which generates investment
in public services; supporting enterprise and wealth creation
by making Britain the best place to do business; and helping
every part of Britain and every person in Britain to con-
tribute to and gain from the strength of our economy. And
as we work globally to tackle climate change we recognise
the challenge and the opportunity of achieving sustainable
development at home.

@ The new Labour case

Our economic record has finally laid to rest the view that Labour could
not be trusted with the economy. We are winning the argument that
economic dynamism and social justice must go hand in hand. In the
future the countries that do best will be those with a shared purpose
about the long-term changes and investments they need to make — and
have the determination to equip their people for that future. So, we
approach new challenges with a progressive strategy for growth. In our
third term we will build new ladders of social mobility and advance-
ment on the firm foundations of stability, investment and growth.

Low debt and high employment

In the last eight years we have pioneered a British way to economic sta-
bility. Our economy has grown in every quarter with this Government.
Interest rates have averaged 5.3 per cent since 1997, saving mortgage
payers on average nearly £4,000 per year compared to the Tory years.

Only with Labour, which constructed this framework, will this
continue. We will maintain our inflation target at two per cent. We will

15

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

continue to meet our fiscal rules: over the economic cycle, we will bor-
row only to invest, and keep net debt at a stable and prudent level.

@ Public spending and taxation

The longest period of uninterrupted economic growth in modern
times has enabled the Government to deliver the longest period of sus-
tained investment in public services for a generation. Social security
bills for unemployment have been halved since 1997, saving £5 billion
a year, and we are also saving £4 billion a year on debt interest pay-
ments. Over the ten-year period 1997-98 to 2007-08, real-terms
investment per year in education will have risen by 4.8 per cent and in
health by 6.5 per cent.

‘We are winning the argument that
economic dynamism and social
: . . ’

justice must go hand in hand.
Every pound we invest goes further because of our drive for efficiency
and reform. Labour will complete the implementation of Sir Peter
Gershon’s recommendations to improve public-service efficiency
and root out waste, liberating over £21 billion for investment in front-
line services.
Labour believes tax policy should continue to be governed by the
health of the public finances, the requirement for public investment

and the needs of families, business and the environment.

We will not raise the basic or top rates of income tax in the next
Parliament. We renew our pledge not to extend VAT to food, children’s

clothes, books, newspapers and public transport fares. We will contin-
ue to make targeted tax cuts for families and to support work. As a
result of personal tax and benefit measures introduced since 1997, by
October 2005 families with children will be on average £1,400 a year
better off in real terms. Living standards in Britain have been rising, on
average, by 2.5 per cent per year since 1997 — a total increase of
nearly 20 per cent.

We want a tax regime that supports British business. That is why we
have cut corporation tax to its lowest ever level, introduced the best
regime of capital gains tax in any industrialised country, and intro-
duced a new Research and Development tax credit.

@ Full employment

Our goal is employment opportunity for all — the modern definition of
full employment. Britain has more people in work than ever before,
with the highest employment rate in the G7. Our long-term aim is to
raise the employment rate to 80 per cent. And, as we move more peo-
ple from welfare to work, the savings on unemployment benefits will
go towards investing more in education.

We will make work pay. With Labour’s tax credits a family with two
children pays no net tax until their earnings reach £21,000.

We will implement the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission
to raise the minimum wage to £5.05 from October 2005 and £5.35
from October 2006.

The New Deals and the creation of JobCentre Plus have made a major
contribution to cutting unemployment. The active welfare state
created since 1997 is working.

The Tories trebled the number on incapacity benefits. We will help

17

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

people who can work into rehabilitation and eventually into employ-
ment, recognising the practical assistance to disabled people of the
Access to Work scheme. We will build on the successful Pathways to
Work programme and reform Incapacity Benefit, with the main ele-
ments of the new benefit regime in place from 2008. The majority of
claimants with more manageable conditions will be required to engage
in both work-focused interviews and in activity to help them prepare
for a return to work. Those with the most severe conditions will also be
encouraged to engage in activity and should receive more money than
now. We will continue to welcome new independent and voluntary
sector partners to provide job-seeking services.

& Supporting enterprise

Government does not create wealth but it must support the wealth
creators. That is why our priorities are the national infrastructure of
skills, science, regulation and planning, and transport. The economy of
the future will be based on knowledge, innovation and creativity. That
applies both to manufacturing and services.

In a fast changing global economy, government cannot postpone or
prevent change. The modern role for government -— the case for a mod-
ern employment and skills policy — is to equip people to succeed, to be
on their side, helping them become more skilled, adaptable and flexi-
ble for the job ahead rather than the old Tory way of walking away
leaving people unaided to face change.

Successful manufacturing industries are vital to our future prosperity.
The Labour Government backs manufacturing: from launch invest-
ment for Airbus A380 Super Jumbo to the successful Manufacturing
Advisory Service helping 13,000 of our smaller manufacturing busi-
nesses in its first year. In a third term we will continue to do so.

Public procurement is a big opportunity for business in Britain and

18

‘In our third term we
will build new ladders
of social mobilty and

advancement on the firm
foundations of stability,

investment and growth.’

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

the source of many jobs. We will promote a public procurement strat-
egy that safeguards UK jobs and skills, under EU rules, to ensure that
British industry can compete fairly with the rest of Europe.

Britain has some of the strongest capital markets in the world. We are
determined they — and our financial services industry — should
prosper. We will ensure that companies have the right framework of
corporate governance and relationships with the institutions that invest
our pension funds and savings in them.

§ Skills at work

Our reforms to 14-19 education (see chapter 2) will raise the quality
and quantity of apprenticeships and vocational education. We are now
putting in place a comprehensive and ambitious strategy to help every-
one get on at work:

* All adults to get free access to basic skills in literacy, language and numeracy.

*A new national programme, working with employers, to ensure that
employees who did not reach GCSE standard (level 2) at school will get
time off for free training up to level 2.

*A new partnership between government and employers to fund workplace
training at level 3 (technician level)

*A genuinely employer-driven training system — in every sector there will
be a Sector Skills Council determining the training strategy and a leading
edge Skills Academy.

*A nationwide system of advice — bringing together support on skills, jobs
and careers — helping people to get on at work.

*A strong partnership with trade unions to boost workplace training includ-
ing a new TUC Academy and continued support for Union Learning Reps.

® Supporting science
The alliance of scientific research and business creativity is key to our

continued prosperity.

20

Economy: Rising prosperity in an opportunity society

Looking ahead, we are committed to a ten-year strategy on science
and innovation that will continue to invest in our science and industri-
al base at least in line with trend GDP. Our ambition now is to raise the
UR’s total private and public sector investment in research and devel-
opment, as a proportion of national income, from its current 1.9 per
cent to 2.5 per cent by 2014.

Our pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are world leaders.
We have created one of the world’s best environments for stem-cell
research. We have now passed legislation to protect our researchers
from the activities of animal rights extremists.

Across a range of environmental issues — from soil erosion to the deple-
tion of marine resources, from water scarcity to air pollution — it is
clear now not just that economic activity is their cause but that these
problems in themselves threaten future economic activity and growth.
We will continue to work with the environmental goods and services
sector — which is already worth £25 billion to the economy to promote
new green technologies and industries in the UK and internationally,
and use the purchasing power of government to support environmen-
tal improvement.

® Competition, planning and regulation

Competition is a driving force for innovation. Our competition regime
has been toughened with independent competition bodies and
stronger penalties.

To the benefit of business and household consumers we are liberalis-
ing the postal services market, while protecting the universal service at

a uniform tariff.

As we said in our policy document Britain is Working, we have given
the Royal Mail greater commercial freedom and have no plans to

21

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

privatise it. Our ambition is to see a publicly owned Royal Mail fully
restored to good health, providing customers with an excellent service
and its employees with rewarding employment. We will review the
impact on the Royal Mail of market liberalisation, which is being pro-
gressively introduced under the Postal Services Act 2000 and which
allows alternative carriers to the Royal Mail to offer postal services.

We have reformed our energy markets to make them open and com-
petitive. And we are a leading force in the campaign to make Europe’s
energy markets the same. Our wider energy policy has created a
framework that places the challenge of climate change — as well as the
need to achieve security of supply — at the heart of our energy policy.
We have a major programme to promote renewable energy, as part of
a strategy of having a mix of energy sources from nuclear power sta-
tions to clean coal to micro-generators.

We will only regulate where necessary and will set exacting targets for
reducing the costs of administering regulations. We will rationalise
business inspections. The merger of the Inland Revenue and Customs
and Excise will cut the administrative costs of tax compliance for small
businesses.

We will take further action in Europe to ensure that EU regulations are
proportionate and better designed. We strongly support the creation of
an EU single market in services to match the single market in goods —
and want an effective directive to provide real benefits to consumers
and new opportunities to British business. We will protect our employ-
ment standards. In developing the directive we will want to avoid any
undermining of our regulatory framework.

We will continue to work to protect the rights of consumers, bringing
forward proposals to strengthen and streamline consumer advocacy.

We look forward to action from the banking industry to remove delays

22

Economy: Rising prosperity in an opportunity society

in processing cheques and other payments and, if necessary, will legis-
late to ensure this early in the next Parliament.

‘There are many bank accounts that are lying dormant and unclaimed,
often because people have forgotten about them or because the owner
has died. We will work with the financial services industry to establish
acommon definition and a comprehensive record of unclaimed assets.
We will then expect banks, over the course of the Parliament, to either
reunite those assets with their owners or to channel them back into the
community.

An effective planning regime protects the environment while promot-
ing economic growth — and does so quickly and responsively. In the
next term, we will ensure that our planning system continues to pro-
tect the sustainability of local and regional environments — and we will
continue to develop a regime which is simpler, faster and more respon-
sive to local and business needs including the need to create jobs and

regenerate our cities.

® Fostering entrepreneurship

There are 300,000 more businesses now than in 1997. We are tackling
barriers to financing for small and growing businesses — especially
enterprises in deprived areas. Through Business Links we will offer
start-ups, social enterprises and small businesses access to tailored
intensive support and coaching.To foster the entrepreneurs of tomor-
row, by 2006 every school in the country will offer enterprise educa-
tion, and every college and university should be twinned with a
business champion.

@ Modern transport infrastructure

An efficient transport system is vital to the country’s future, to our
economy and to our quality of life. We welcome the freedom that addi-
tional travel provides and support the continuing development of a

23

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

competitive and efficient freight sector. Investment, better management
of road and rail, and planning ahead are vital to deal with the pressures
on the system in a way that respects our environmental objectives.

We have doubled transport spending since 1997 and will increase it
year on year — committing over £180 billion in public money between
now and 2015 as well as private investment. The Eddington Review
will work with the Government to advise on how this investment
should be targeted — in particular, where transport is vital to underpin
economic growth.

We are now taking charge of setting the strategy for rail to further raise
the standard of service and reliability. We will examine options for
increasing capacity, including a new generation of high-speed trains
on intercity routes and a new life for rural branch lines as community
railways. We are committed to continuing to work to develop a funding
and finance solution for the Crossrail project; and will look at the fea-
sibility and affordability of a new North-South high-speed link.

We will support light-rail improvements where they represent value
for money and are part of the best integrated transport solution. To
that end, we are working with cities across the country and have com-
mitted £520 million to Manchester for Metrolink. We will support the
continuing upgrade of the London Underground and the extension of
the East London line.

Major investment is planned to expand capacity on the M1, M6 and
M25.We must also manage road space better. We are examining the
potential benefits of a parallel Expressway on the M6 corridor. We will
introduce car-pool lanes for cars with more than one passenger on
suitable roads and explore other ways to lock in the benefit of new
capacity. We will complete the introduction of Traffic Management
Officers to keep traffic flowing. Because of the long-term nature of

24

Economy: Rising prosperity in an opportunity society

transport planning, we will seek political consensus in tackling conges-
tion, including examining the potential of moving away from the cur-
rent system of motoring taxation towards a national system of
road-pricing.

We will give all over-60s, and disabled people, free off-peak local bus
travel and give local authorities the freedom to provide more generous
schemes. We will continue to support growth in bus provision includ-
ing innovation in school transport, with greater opportunity for local
authorities to control their bus networks where they are demonstrating
value for money and taking strong measures to tackle congestion. To
facilitate improved public transport provision, we will explore giving
Passenger Transport Executives greater powers over local transport.

We will continue funding local authorities and voluntary groups to
make cycling and walking more attractive. We are committed to reduc-

 

ing child deaths and serious injuries on the road by 50 per cent, and we
will continue to work to reduce dangerous driving, especially drink
driving and uninsured driving. We will work with industry to make
travel on public transport safer and more secure.

Government will continue to support technological innovation to
reduce carbon emissions such as the hydrogen fuel-cell buses in
London. We will explore the scope for further use of economic instru-
ments as well as other measures to promote lower vehicle emissions.

We will continue to support air travel by implementing the balanced
policies set out in our aviation white paper. We are committed to using
the UR’s 2005 presidency of the European Union to promote the
inclusion of aviation in the EU’s emissions trading scheme.

For shipping, our introduction of the tonnage tax has led to a trebling
in size of the fleet since 1997. We want more ships to fly the British

25

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

flag, to boost jobs and training, and to increase shipping and port
capacity.

® Opportunity for all

We are determined to spread the benefits of enterprise to every com-
munity in the country. Every regional economy has different strengths,
and Regional Development Agencies now play an essential role in
regional economic development.

‘Our economy has grown in every

quarter under this Government.’

We have given local authorities a direct incentive to promote local
business creation, allowing them to keep up to £1 billion over three
years of increased rate revenues to spend on their own priorities.
The Local Enterprise Growth Initiative will work through local
authorities to remove barriers to enterprise in the most deprived
areas of England.

In 1997, many parts of our towns and cities were suffering from
deeply entrenched and multiple disadvantage. To tackle this we estab-
lished a ten-year programme, the New Deal for Communities,
empowering local communities — and this is already delivering
improvements in education outcomes and crime reduction.

No area in our country should be excluded from the opportunity to
get ahead, to benefit from improving public services, and to be secure
and safe. We will maintain our commitment to tackling issues of
worklessness, low skills, crime, poor environment and health in our
poorest neighbourhoods.

26

Economy: Rising prosperity in an opportunity society

@ Fairness at work

Since 1997, the Labour Government has introduced new rights for
people at work and new opportunities for trade unions to represent
their members. We see modern, growing trade unions as an important
part of our society and economy. They provide protection and advice
for employees, and we welcome the positive role they have played in
developing a modern model of social partnership with business repre-
sentatives. The Labour Party has agreed a set of policies for the work-
place (the Warwick Agreement) and we will deliver them in full. They
will be good for employees and for the economy.

We have introduced, for the first time, an entitlement for every
employee to four weeks’ paid holiday, and we propose to extend this
by making it additional to bank holiday entitlement.

@ Promoting equality at work

A strong economy draws on the talents of all. We have extended legis-
lation to protect people from discrimination at work to cover not only
gender, disability, race and ethnicity but also religion and sexual orien-
tation and — from 2006 — age. Labour has transformed legal rights for
disabled people. We will empower disabled people further by joining
up services and expanding personalised budgets.

We will take further action to narrow the pay and promotion gap
between men and women. The Women and Work Commission will
report to the Prime Minister later this year.

We will implement the National Employment Panel’s report on meas-
ures to promote employment and small business growth for ethnic
and faith minorities. We will take forward the Strategy for Race
Equality to ensure that we combat discrimination on the grounds of
race and ethnicity across a range of services. The Equalities Review
reporting to the Prime Minister in 2006 will make practical

27

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

recommendations on the priorities for tackling disadvantage and pro-
moting equality of opportunity for all groups.

@ Thriving rural areas

Since 1997, Labour has made it more difficult to close rural schools,
put in £750 million to support rural post offices and introduced a
50 per cent rate relief on village shops. Through our £51 million Rural
Bus Subsidy Grant we have delivered over 2,200 new bus services in
rural areas this year.

We set targets for the creation of affordable homes in rural areas, which
we have now exceeded. We will explore how to ensure a proportion of
all new housing development is made available and affordable to local
residents and their families.

Because of our success in achieving extensive reforms in the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP), 2005 will be the first year for decades when
farmers will be free to produce for the market and not simply for sub-
sidy. We will continue to push for further reform of the CAP in the
next Parliament, starting with the sugar regime.

We will continue to promote the competitiveness of the whole food
sector, and assure the safety and quality of its products. We will intro-
duce an explicit policy for schools, hospitals and government offices to
consider local sourcing of fresh produce. We will continue to improve
the environmental performance of agriculture, rewarding every farmer
in England for environmental protection and enhancement work
through our new Stewardship schemes. We will also promote biomass,
bio-fuels and non-food crops. We will work to tackle diffuse water pol-
lution through addressing impacts across water catchments without
the costs falling on water customers.

Under difficult circumstances, Labour is working with the fishing

28

Economy: Rising prosperity in an opportunity society

industry to create a sustainable long-term future for the fishing com-
munities of the United Kingdom. We have reformed the Common
Fisheries Policy and will continue to protect the marine environment
and ensure fish stocks and their exploitation are set at sustainable levels.

We will introduce the Animal Welfare Bill as soon as possible in the
new Parliament.

The choice for 2010

The Conservatives are the party of high interest rates, high infla-
tion, mass unemployment and house repossessions. Their tax-
and-spend promises do not add up; and they would cut £35
billion from public investment. With new Labour, Britain can
seize the opportunities of globalisation, creating jobs and pros-
perity for people up and down the country. We can only do so if
we build a clear sense of shared national economic purpose, not
just around economic stability but also investment in infrastruc-
ture, skills, science and enterprise. The choice is to go forward to
economic stability, rising prosperity and wider opportunities
with new Labour. Or go back to the bad old days of Tory cuts,
insecurity and instability.

Britain forward not back

Education is still our number one priority. In our first term,
we transformed recruitment, training and methods of teach-
ing, with record results in primary schools. In our second
term we have driven fundamental reform in secondary provi-
sion - more teachers and support staff, more money, special-
ist schools and the Academies programmes. Our plan now is
to tailor our education system to individual pupil needs, with
parents supporting teachers and support staff in further rais-
ing standards. That means music, art, sport and languages as
well as English and maths in primary school; a good second-
ary school for every child, with modern buildings and excel-
lent specialist teaching; catch-up support for all children who
need it; the guarantee of a sixth-form place, apprenticeship
or further education at 16; sufficient quality and quantity in
higher education. At each stage we send a clear message —
every child has a right to a good education, but no child has
the right to disrupt the education of other children.

@ The new Labour case

For generations our country has been held back by an education sys-
tem that excelled for the privileged few but let down the majority.
Every child can and should be able to fulfil their potential. We will
achieve this by uniting our commitment to equal opportunities for all
children with a reform programme which gives every child and young
person, from pre-school to sixth-form or apprenticeship and beyond,
the personalised package of learning and support they need. In a third
term, we will entrench high expectations for every child, ensure the
flexibility of provision to meet all needs and make parents true part-
ners as we aim for the highest ever school standards.

@ Every pupil with better teaching

There is no greater responsibility than teaching the next generation.
Head teachers, teachers and support staff deserve support and

31

‘Our plan now 1s to
tailor our education
system to individual
pupil needs, with parents
supporting teachers and
support staff in further

raising standards.’

Education: More children making the grade

respect. There are now over 28,000 more teachers and 105,000 more
support staff than in 1997; graduate teacher applications are up 70 per
cent; average salaries are up by more than 30 per cent. The remodel-
ling of the school workforce is benefiting staff and helping to tailor
provision to pupil need. We will now go further — to intensify in-serv-
ice training for teachers, to widen further routes into teaching, to help
more teachers and pupils get the benefit of the range of support staff
now working in schools, from learning mentors to music and arts
specialists. The goal is clear: every pupil with extra support in their
weakest subjects and extra opportunities in their strongest.

We want to see every pupil mastering the basics. If they are not mas-
tered by 11, there will be extra time in the secondary curriculum to get
them right: schools will be judged on how pupils do in English and
maths at the ages of 11, 14 and 16.

We want every pupil to be stretched, including the brightest, so we will
develop extended projects at A-level, harder A-level questions to chal-
lenge the most able, and give universities the individual module marks
—as well as overall grades — of A-level students.

@ Every school with more money and effective leadership
Since 1997, school funding has risen by £1,000 per pupil. Education
spending that was 4.7 per cent of national income in 1997 will rise to
5.5 per cent this year. We will continue to raise the share of national
income devoted to education. And we will continue to recognise the
additional needs of disadvantaged pupils. We will also ensure funda-
mental reform in the way the money is spent. Funding will be allocat-
ed ona multi-year timescale. There will be a dedicated national schools
budget set by central government, with a guaranteed per pupil increase
for every school. Heads and governors will be in control. Successful
schools and colleges will have the independence to take decisions
about how to deploy resources and develop their provision. Schools

33

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

will work together to raise standards. New provision will be created
where standards are too low or innovation is needed. Local authorities
have a vital role in championing the parent interest and providing sup-

port services.

A strong, effective governing body is essential to the success of every
school and governors must be given support to help them play this
role. We will allow more flexibility in the structure of governing bod-
ies, including the ability to have smaller governing bodies, of ten
members or less, to streamline management while strengthening the
position of parents.

® Parents as partners

Our aim for the education system is to nurture the unique talents of
every child. But children and schools do best with real and effective
parental engagement. Parents should have the information and
support they need to encourage their children, from the first reading
book to the key choices they make at 14 and 16. And parents should
be central to the process of assessing school performance and driving
improvement, as well as their vital role in promoting good behaviour
and raising the quality of school meals (see chapter 4).

All schools should have good home-school links, building on the new
school and pupil profiles. Some schools are using ICT to make con-
tact between parents and schools easier and better for both sides. We
will encourage all schools to follow suit.

Ofsted now actively seeks the views of parents when undertaking
inspections. Ofsted will be given new powers to respond to parental
complaints and where necessary to close failing schools or replace fail-
ing management.

34

Education: More children making the grade

@ Enriching primary schools

International studies show that our ten-year-olds are the third highest
achievers in literacy in the world and the fastest improving in maths.
Three-quarters of 11-year-olds now reach high standards in reading,
writing and maths. We will intensify our literacy and numeracy pro-
gramme to help an extra 50,000 pupils achieve high standards at age 11,
reaching our targets of 85 per cent of pupils succeeding at the basics.

All primary school children will have access to high-quality tuition in
the arts, music, sport and foreign languages. We have set aside funds
for this purpose, working with head teachers to develop support pro-
grammes and modernise the school workforce.

We have abolished infant class sizes of more than 30, and almost all
primary schools have gained improved facilities since 1997. We will
now upgrade primary schools nationwide in a 15-year Building
Schools for the Future programme, including under-fives and child-
care facilities where needed. Primary schools will become the base for
a massive expansion of out-of-school provision (see chapter 6).

Foundation schools operate within the local family of state schools, and
are funded in the same way as others, but manage their own assets and
employ their staff directly. We will allow successful primary schools, like
secondary schools, to become foundation schools by a simple vote of
their governing body following consultation with their parents.

l™@ Every secondary school an independent specialist school
We want all secondary schools to be independent specialist schools with
astrong ethos, high-quality leadership, good discipline (including school
uniforms), setting by ability and high-quality facilities as the norm.

The way to achieve this is not a return to the 11-plus or a free-for-all
on admissions policies. It is to ensure that independent specialist

*,..we will entrench high
expectations for every
child, provide the flexibihty
of provision to meet all
needs and make parents
true partners as we aim for
the highest ever school

standards.’

Education: More children making the grade

schools tailor education to the needs, interests and aptitudes of each
pupil within a fair admissions system.

There are over 2,000 specialist schools — schools which teach the entire
national curriculum and also have a centre of excellence. Their results
are improving faster than those of non-specialist schools. We want
every secondary school to become a specialist school and existing spe-
cialist schools will be able to take on a second specialism. Over time all
specialist schools will become extended schools, with full programmes
of after-school activities.

Every part of the country will benefit, over fifteen years, from the
Building Schools for the Future programme. This is a once in a gener-
ation programme to equip the whole country with modern secondary
education facilities, open five days a week, ten hours a day.

Good schools will be able to expand their size and also their influence
— by taking over less successful schools. We will develop a system to
create rights for successful schools to establish sixth-form provision
where there is pupil and parent demand, extending quality and choice
for local students.

Britain has a positive tradition of independent providers within the
state system, including church and other faith schools. Where new
educational providers can help boost standards and opportunities in a
locality we will welcome them into the state system, subject to parental
demand, fair funding and fair admissions.

We strongly support the new Academies movement. Seventeen of
these independent non-selective schools are now open within the state
system; their results are improving sharply, and 50 more are in the
pipeline. Within the existing allocation of resources our aim is that at
least 200 Academies will be established by 2010 in communities where

37

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

low aspirations and low performance are entrenched.

We will encourage more small schools and boarding schools as ways of
helping the most disadvantaged children. We will make sure schools in
deprived areas receive the resources they need. 'To enable all young
people to enjoy the opportunities previously enjoyed by the few, we are
developing a nationwide week-long summer residential programme
for school students. We support partnership between the state and pri-
vate sectors to bridge the unhealthy historic divide between the two.

® Good discipline

Every pupil has the right to learn without disruption; no teacher should
be subject to abuse or disrespect. We have given head teachers the
powers needed to maintain discipline and the highest standards of
conduct. Violent behaviour, including the use of knives will not be tol-
erated. We are also working with schools and teacher organisations to
implement a zero tolerance approach to lower-level disruption. The
number of places in out-of-school units has almost doubled, and the
quality of provision has been enhanced. We will give head teachers
within each locality direct control of the budgets for out-of-school
provision, so they can expand and improve it as needed. We will
encourage more dedicated provision for disruptive and excluded
pupils, including by charities and voluntary groups with expertise in
this area, and no school will become a dumping ground for
such pupils.

Parents have a duty to get their children to attend school. We have
introduced parenting orders and fines and will continue to advocate
truancy sweeps.

@ Special educational needs

Children with special educational needs require appropriate resources
and support from trained staff. For some this will be in mainstream

38

Education: More children making the grade

schools; for others, it will be in special schools. Parents should have
access to the special education appropriate for their child. It is the role
of local authorities to make decisions on the shape of local provision, in
consultation with local parents.

@ No more dropping out at 16
The historic problems of our education system at 14-plus have been an
academic track that has been too narrow and a vocational offer too weak.

We are determined to raise the status and quality of vocational educa-
tion. Beyond the age of 14, GCSEs and A-levels will be the foundation
of the system in which high-quality vocational programmes will be
available to every pupil. Designed in collaboration with employers,
specialised diplomas will be established in key areas of the economy,
leading to apprenticeships, to further and higher education and to jobs
with training. We will review progress on the development of the 14-19
curriculum in 2008.

We will not let economic disadvantage stand in the way of young peo-
ple staying in education beyond the age of 16. We have rolled out
Educational Maintenance Allowances, providing lower income stu-
dents with a £30-a-week staying-on allowance. We believe that every-
one up to the age of 19 should be learning, so we will expand
sixth-form, college and apprenticeship places, and ensure that all 16-
to 19-year-olds in employment get access to training.

We believe that every 16- to 19-year-old should have dedicated super-
vision and support, including in the further education sector. We will
support sixth-form colleges and expect FE colleges to have dedicated
centres for 16- to 19-year-olds.

Further education is vital to vocational lifelong learning. Achieving a
transformation of FE colleges requires both our increased investment

39

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

and serious reform. Every FE college will develop a centre for voca-
tional excellence, and we will establish new skills academies led by
leading entrepreneurs and employers from the relevant skill sectors.
Sir Andrew Foster’s review will help shape the reform process.

& Children’s Trusts

Ofsted reports show that local government is continuing to improve
the vital services on which schools and families rely. Education and
social services should collaborate to help youngsters, especially the
most vulnerable, achieve their potential. Local government should be
the champion of parents and high-quality provision, including special
needs education, school transport, and other support services. We are
reforming local education authorities to form Children’s Trusts to pro-
vide seamless support to children and families and work in partner-
ship with the private and voluntary sectors.

®@ World-class higher education, open to all

Universities are critical to Britain’s future prosperity. We need a bigger,
better higher education system. We are investing £1 billion more in the
science base, and increasing public spending on higher education by
34 per cent in real terms. But graduates and employers must also play
their part. Our funding reforms will generate £1 billion of extra funds
by 2010; the abolition of up-front fees and the creation of grants will
help poorer students. A quarter of the income from the new student
finance system will go to bursaries for students from poorer families.
‘The maximum annual fee paid by students will not rise above £3,000
(uprated annually for inflation) during the next Parliament.

As school standards rise we maintain our aim for 50 per cent of young
people to go on to higher education by 2010. Two-year foundation
degrees in vocational disciplines have a key part to play.

PhD students are vital to universities and the nation’s research base.

40

Education: More children making the grade

The number of PhD students in the UK has risen by nearly 10,000
since 1997, and we are carrying through a 30 per cent increase in aver-
age PhD stipends to make doctoral research still more attractive to
high-flyers.

We will incentivise all universities to raise more charitable and private
funding for student bursaries and endowments.

The choice for 2010

Under their last government the Conservatives spent more on
unemployment and debt interest than on education. Their pri-
ority now is to take at least £1 billion from state schools to sub-
sidise private education for the privileged few. In addition they
would allow a free-for-all in school admissions — including an
extension of selection — for five- and 11-year-olds, cap the num-
ber of pupils who can succeed at GCSE and A-level, and reduce
places in higher education. The choice for 2010 is forward with
new Labour: pupils with quality and opportunity through the
system from three to 18; parents with the confidence that where
there is no improvement there will be intervention; teachers
knowing that quality will be supported and rewarded; and
employers with a system that gets the basics right and provides
the skills that industry needs. Or back with the Tories to an edu-
cation system designed to look after the few but fail the many.

42

Britain forward not back

Today, there is less chance of being a victim of crime than for
more than 20 years. But our security is threatened by major
organised crime; volume crimes such as burglary and car
theft, often linked to drug abuse; fear of violent crime; and
anti-social behaviour. Each needs a very different approach.
We are giving the police and local councils the power to tackle
anti-social behaviour; we will develop neighbourhood polic-
ing for every community and crack down on drug dealing and
hard drug use to reduce volume crime; we are modernising
our asylum and immigration system; and we will take the nec-
essary measures to protect our country from international
terrorism.

@ The new Labour case

The modern world offers freedoms and opportunities unheralded a
generation ago. But with new freedoms come new fears and threats to
our security. Our progressive case is that to counter these threats we
need strong communities built on mutual respect and the rule of law.
We prize the liberty of the individual; but that means protecting the
law-abiding majority from the minority who abuse the system. We
believe in being tough on crime and its causes so we will expand drugs
testing and treatment, and tackle the conditions — from lack of youth
provision to irresponsible drinking — that foster crime and anti-social
behaviour. In a third term we will make the contract of rights and
responsibilities an enduring foundation of community life.

@ A neighbourhood policing team for every community

Overall crime as measured by the authoritative British Crime Survey
is down 30 per cent— the equivalent of almost five million fewer crimes
a year. Record numbers of police — almost 13,000 more than in 1997
— working with 4,600 new Community Support Officers (CSOs),
local councils, and the Crown Prosecution Service deserve the credit.
But local people want a more visible police presence and a role in

43

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

setting local police priorities. So our pledge is a neighbourhood polic-
ing team for every community. We will carry on funding the police
service to enable it to continue to employ historically high numbers of
police officers.

Hard-working police officers should be supported by professional and
trained support staff. So a new £340 million a year fund will take CSO
numbers up to 24,000 — to work alongside the equivalent of an addi-
tional 12,000 police officers freed up for frontline duties. And we will
work with representatives of police officers and other police staff to
develop a modern career framework for the whole police team.

Not all problems need a 999 response, so a single phone number
staffed by police, local councils and other local services will be avail-
able across the country to deal with anti-social behaviour and other
non-emergency problems.

& Empowering communities against anti-social behaviour
People want communities where the decent law-abiding majority are
in charge. The experience of almost 4,000 Anti-Social Behaviour
Orders, nearly 66,000 Penalty Notices for Disorder, and the closure of
over 150 crack houses shows that communities can fight back against
crime. We are ready to go further.

Parish Council wardens, like those working for local authorities, will be
given the power to issue Penalty Notices for Disorder for noise, graffi-
ti and throwing fireworks. Victims of anti-social behaviour will be able
to give evidence anonymously. Local people will be able to take on
‘neighbours from hell’ by triggering action by councils and the police.

We have reformed housing and planning legislation to ensure that
councils plan for the needs of genuine Gypsies and travellers. But with

rights must go responsibilities so we have provided tough new powers

44

‘We are giving the police
and local councils the
power to tackle anti-social
behaviour; we will develop
neighbourhood policing for

every community...”

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

for councils and the police to tackle the problem of unauthorised sites.

Excessive alcohol consumption fuels anti-social behaviour and vio-
lence. The new Licensing Act will make it easier for the police and
councils to deal with pubs and clubs that cause problems. Local coun-
cils and police will be able to designate Alcohol Disorder Zones to help
pay for extra policing around city centre pubs and clubs, with new
powers to immediately shut down premises selling alcohol to under-
age drinkers, and bans from town and city centres for persistent
offenders. Police will be able to exclude yobs from town centres for 24
hours when they issue a Penalty Notice for Disorder.

‘We believe in being tough on crime
and its causes so we will expand drugs
testing and treatment, and tackle the
conditions...that foster crime and
anti-social behaviour’

We will continue to overhaul our youth justice system and improve
‘Young Offender Institutions. We will make more use of intensive com-
munity programmes, including electronic tagging and tracking to deal
with the most persistent young offenders, and will increase the num-
ber of parents of young offenders getting help with their children’s
behaviour. We will increase, by at least a half, programmes targeted at

young people most at risk of offending and will expand drug-treat-
ment services for young people.

46

Crime and security: Safe communities, secure borders

® Cutting crime through cutting drug dependency
Communities know that crime reduction depends on drug reduction.
There are now 54 per cent more drug users in treatment and new
powers for the police to close crack houses and get drug dealers off our
streets. We will introduce compulsory drug testing at arrest for all
property and drugs offenders, beginning in high-crime areas, with
compulsory treatment assessment for those who test positive.
Offenders under probation supervision will be randomly drug tested
to mirror what already happens to offenders in custody.

From 2006, the Serious Organised Crime Agency will bring together
over 4,000 specialist staff to tackle terrorism, drug dealers, people traf-
fickers and other national and international organized criminals. And
in consultation with local police authorities and chief constables we
will re-structure police resources in order to develop strong leadership,
streamline all police support services, and focus upon national and
regional organised crime.

@ Reducing the use of guns and knives

Dangerous weapons fuel violence. We have banned all handguns,
introduced five-year minimum sentences for those caught with an
unlawful firearm and raised the age limit for owning an air gun. Now
we will go further. We will introduce a Violent Crime Reduction Bill to
restrict the sale of replica guns, raise the age limit for buying knives to
18 and tighten the law on air guns. Head teachers will have legal rights
to search pupils for knives or guns. At-risk pubs and clubs will be
required to search for them and we will introduce tougher
sentences for carrying replica guns, for those involved in serious knife
crimes and for those convicted of assaulting workers serving the public.

® Punishing criminals, reducing offending
As court sentences have got tougher, we have built over 16,000 more

prison places than there were in 1997. The most high-risk violent

47

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

offenders will now be detained in custody indefinitely and our 2003
Criminal Justice Act confirmed that life sentences must mean life for the
most heinous murders. Where significant new evidence comes to light
we have abolished the ‘double jeopardy’ rule so that serious criminals
who have been unjustly acquitted can be tried again. And we will intro-
duce much tougher penalties for those who cause death by careless driv-
ing or who kill while driving without a licence or while disqualified.

We will tackle reoffending. By 2007 every offender will be supervised
after release; we will increase the use of electronic tagging; and we will
test the use of compulsory lie detector tests to monitor convicted sex
offenders. Our new National Offender Management Service will ensure
that every offender is individually case-managed from beginning to end
of their sentence, both in and out of custody — with increased effort tar-
geted on drugs treatment, education and basic skills training to reduce
reoffending. Voluntary organisations and the private sector will be
offered greater opportunities to deliver offender services and we will
give local people a greater say in shaping community punishment.

®@ Making sure crime does not pay

Those who commit crimes should not profit from them. Already we
have introduced laws that enable the courts to confiscate the assets and
property of drug dealers and other major criminals. We will enable the
police and prosecuting authorities to keep at least half of all the crimi-
nal assets they seize to fund local crime-fighting priorities. And we will
develop new proposals to ensure that criminals are not able to profit
from publishing books about their crimes. In addition we will support
magistrates effectively in fighting crime and improve the enforcement
of court decisions — including the payment of fines.

Where a defendant fails to turn up for court without good excuse, the pre-
sumption should be that the trial and sentencing should go ahead anyway.

48

Crime and security: Safe communities, secure borders

We will overhaul laws on fraud and the way that fraud trials are con-
ducted to update them for the 21st century and make them quicker
and more effective.

“Overall crime...is down 30 per cent —
the equivalent of almost five million

fewer crimes a year?

@ Backing the victim

The legal system must dispense justice to the victim as well as the
accused. We have invested to create a modern, self-confident prosecu-
tion service. With new powers and new technology to bring more
offenders to justice more speedily and effectively. We will improve the
way the courts work for victims, witnesses and jurors by:

* Building a nationwide network of witness and victim support units that
provide practical help.

* Expanding specialist courts to deal with domestic violence and specialist
advocates to support the victims of such crime and of other serious crimes

like murder and rape.

We will extend the use of restorative justice schemes and Community
Justice Centres to address the needs of victims, resolve disputes and
help offenders to make recompense to victims for their crimes.

Legal aid will be reformed to better help the vulnerable. We will ensure
independent regulation of the legal profession, and greater competi-
tion in the legal services market to ensure people get value for money.
We will tackle the compensation culture — resisting invalid claims, but
upholding people’s rights.

Crime and security: Safe communities, secure borders

Following consultation on the draft Bill we have published, we will leg-
islate for a new offence of corporate manslaughter.

& Migration: The facts

Over seven million people entered the UK from outside the EU in
2003: of whom 180,000 came here to work and over 300,000 to study,
with the rest coming here as business visitors and tourists. People from
overseas spent almost £12 billion in the UK, and overseas students
alone are worth £5 billion a year to our economy. At a time when we
have over 600,000 vacancies in the UK job market, skilled migrants
are contributing 10-15 per cent of our economy’s overall growth.

Since 1997, the time taken to process an initial asylum application has
been reduced from 20 months to two months in over 80 per cent of
cases. The number of asylum applications has been cut by two-thirds
since 2002. The backlog of claims has been cut from over 50,000 at
the end of 1996 to just over 10,000. There are 550 UK Immigration
Officers posted in France and Belgium to check passports of people
boarding boats and trains, and Airline Liaison Officers and overseas
entry clearance staff are helping to stop 1,000 people a day improper-
ly entering the UR.

® Building a strong and diverse country

For centuries Britain has been a home for people from the rest of
Europe and further afield. Immigration has been good for Britain. We
want to keep it that way.

Our philosophy is simple: if you are ready to work hard and there is work
for you to do, then you are welcome here. We need controls that work
and a crackdown on abuse to ensure that we have a robust and fair immi-
gration system fit for the 21st century that is in the interests of Britain.

51

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

A points system for immigration

We need skilled workers. So we will establish a points system for those
seeking to migrate here. More skills mean more points and more
chance of being allowed to come here.

We will ensure that only skilled workers are allowed to settle long-term
in the UK, with English language tests for everyone who wants to stay
permanently and an end to chain migration.

Where there has been evidence of abuse from particular countries, the
immigration service will be able to ask for financial bonds to guarantee
that migrants return home. We will continue to improve the quality
and speed of immigration and asylum decisions. Appeal rights for
non-family immigration cases will be removed and we will introduce
civil penalties on employers of up to £2,000 for each illegal immigrant
they employ.

™ Strong and secure borders

While the Tories would halve investment in our immigration services,
we would invest in the latest technology to keep our borders strong
and secure.

By 2008, those needing a visa to enter the UK will be fingerprinted. We
will issue ID cards to all visitors planning to stay for more than three
months. Over the next five years we will implement a new electronic
borders system that will track visitors entering or leaving the UK.

Across the world there is a drive to increase the security of identity
documents and we cannot be left behind. From next year we are intro-
ducing biometric ‘ePassports’. It makes sense to provide citizens with
an equally secure identity card to protect them at home from identity
theft and clamp down on illegal working and fraudulent use of public
services. We will introduce ID cards, including biometric data like

52

Crime and security: Safe communities, secure borders

fingerprints, backed up by a national register and rolling out initially
on a voluntary basis as people renew their passports.

@ Fair rules
We can and should honour our obligations to victims of persecution
without allowing abuse of the asylum system.We will:

* Fast-track all unfounded asylum seekers with electronic tagging where
necessary and more use of detention as we expand the number of deten-
tion places available.

* Remove more failed applicants. We have more than doubled the number of
failed asylum seekers we remove from the UK compared to 1996. By fin-
gerprinting every visa applicant and prosecuting those who deliberately
destroy their documents we will speed up the time taken to redocument
and remove people and will take action against those countries that refuse
to cooperate. By the end of 2005, our aim is for removals of failed asylum

seekers to exceed new unfounded claims.

® Tough action to combat international terrorism

We know that there are people already in the country and who seek to
enter the United Kingdom who want to attack our way of life. Our lib-
erties are prized but so is our security.

Police and other law enforcement agencies now have the powers they
need to ban terrorist organisations, to clampdown on their fundraising
and to hold suspects for extended questioning while charges are
brought. Over 700 arrests have been made since 2001. Wherever pos-
sible, suspects should be prosecuted through the courts in the normal
way. So we will introduce new laws to help catch and convict those
involved in helping to plan terrorist activity or who glorify or condone
acts of terror. But we also need to disrupt and prevent terrorist activi-
ty. New control orders will enable police and security agencies to keep
track on those they suspect of planning terrorist outrages including

53

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

bans on who they can contact or meet, electronic tagging and curfew
orders, and for those who present the highest risk, a requirement to
stay permanently at home.

We will continue to improve coordination between enforcement agen-
cies and cooperation with other countries so that every effort is made
to defeat the terrorists.

The choice for 2010

Labour’s goals for 2010 are clear. Overall crime down, the num-
ber of offenders brought to justice up, with a neighbourhood
policing team in every community to crack down on crime and
disorder and a modern criminal justice system fit for the 21st
century. And to reduce threats from overseas: secure borders
backed up by ID cards and a crackdown on abuse of our immi-
gration system. The Conservative threat is equally clear. Savage
cuts to our border controls, ‘fantasy island’ asylum policies and
a return to the days of broken promises on police numbers and
crime investment.

56

Britain forward not back

The NHS is being restored to good health: more doctors, more
nurses, better facilities. Waiting times are coming down and
the survival rates for the biggest killers are improving. The
revolution in quantity of care must be matched by a revolu-
tion in quality of care. With equal access for all and no charges
for operations. That means new types of health provision,
more say for patients in how, where and when they are treat-
ed, and tackling ill-health at source.

@ The new Labour case

Healthcare is too precious to be left to chance, too central to life
chances to be left to your wealth. Access to treatment should be based
on your clinical need not on your ability to pay. This means defeating
those who would dismantle the NHS. But it also means fundamental-
ly reforming the NHS to meet new challenges — a more demanding
citizenry with higher expectations, major advances in science
and medical technology, changes in the composition and needs of the
population.

‘We promised to revive the NHS;
we have. In our third term we will make

the NHS safe for a generation.’

So our aim is an NHS free to all of us and personal to each of us. We
will deliver through high national standards backed by sustained
investment, by using new providers where they add capacity or pro-
mote innovation, and most importantly by giving more power to
patients over their own treatment and over their own health.

57

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

We promised to revive the NHS; we have. In our third term we will
make the NHS safe for a generation.

@ New investment

NHS spending has doubled since 1997, and will triple by 2008;
already we have an extra 27,000 doctors in post or in training and
79,000 extra nurses; over 100 new hospital building projects under
way; 500,000 more operations a year. We are proud of the dedication
and commitment of NHS staff. We have widened the responsibilities
of nurses and pharmacists, paramedics and porters, creating health
services more convenient for patients.

‘Together with our organisational reforms, the investment is paying off.
The maximum time that people waited for operations in 1997 was
well over 18 months. Now virtually no one waits longer than nine
months, and this year it will fall further to six months. For a heart oper-
ation or for cataract removal no one is waiting longer than three
months; 97 per cent of people wait less than four hours in Accident
and Emergency before treatment, admission or discharge. And speed-
ier treatment saves lives. Death rates from heart disease are down by
27 per cent since 1996; from cancer by 12 per cent.

We will do even better. For too long waiting times have only counted
the time after diagnosis. We will be the first Government to include all
waiting times in this calculation, including waiting for outpatient
appointments and for test results. There will be no hidden waits. So:

* By the end of 2008, no NHS patient will have to wait longer than a
maximum of 18 weeks from the time they are referred for a hospital oper-
ation by their GP until the time they have that operation. This would
mean an average wait of nine to ten weeks.

*We will commit to faster test results for cervical smears.

*We will go further in improving cancer waiting times.

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

All this with equal access for all, free at the point of need with no
charges for hospital operations.

We have tightened the rules on NHS operations so that ‘health tourists’
now have to pay for treatment.

‘One principle underpins our reforms —
putting patients centre stage.
And extending patient power and

choice 1s crucial to achieving this.

We will deal with the challenge of MRSA. Infections acquired in hos-
pital are not new. The time to destroy MRSA was in the early 1990s —
when only five per cent of the bacteria were resistant to antibiotics. At
that time the Tory government did not even keep records about the
incidence of MRSA and were forcing hospitals to contract out clean-
ing services. We were the first government to publish statistics on the
problem. Now, thanks to the tough measures we have already taken,
including the end to a two-tier workforce for contracted-out cleaning
services, MRSA rates are on their way down. But there is still some
way to go. We all want clean hospitals, free of infection. We have already
reintroduced hospital matrons and given them unprecedented powers
to deal with cleanliness and infections in their wards; we shall reinforce
this by consulting on new laws to enforce higher hygiene standards

And by strengthening accountability and cutting bureaucracy, we shall
ensure that the new investment is not squandered. We are decreasing

the numbers of staff in the Department of Health by a third, and are

60

Our NHS: Free to all, personal to each

halving the numbers of quangos — freeing up £500 million for front-
line staff. Given the pace of change within medical services we will
ensure that it is possible for the NHS to change the way in which it
organises its services as quickly as possible. Further streamlining meas-
ures will allow us to release an additional £250 million a year for front-
line services by 2007.

 

In the light of the findings of the Shipman Inquiry, we will strengthen
clinical governance in the NHS to ensure that professional activity is
fully accountable to patients, their families and the wider public.
Following the recommendation of the Health Select Committee, we
will require registration of all clinical trials and publication of their
findings for all trials of medicinal products with a marketing authorisa-
tion in the UK.

§ Innovation and reform

‘To achieve our goals we need to expand and develop different types
of provision. We will put more money into the frontline, develop prac-
tice-based commissioning, and so ensure that family doctors have
more power over their budgets. We will create more services in pri-
mary care. We will build on our family doctor service with more GPs
delivering more advanced services more locally; new walk-in centres
for commuters; specialised diagnostic and testing services; compre-
hensive out-of-hours services; high-street drop-in centres for chi-
ropody, physiotherapy and check-ups. And we will continue to
expand the role of nurses. These changes will result in more quality,
convenience and care.

Expansion in NHS capacity will come both from within the National
Health Service — where we will develop the NHS Foundation Trust
model and the new freedom for GPs to expand provision — as well as
from the independent and voluntary sector, where specialist services
are available at NHS standards to meet NHS need.

61

‘Healthcare 1s too
precious to be left to
chance, too central to life
chances to be left to your
wealth... This means
defeating those who would
dismantle the NHS’

Our NHS: Free to all, personal to each

To help create an even greater range of provision and further improve
convenience, we will over the next five years develop a new generation
of modern NHS community hospitals. These state-of-the-art centres
will provide diagnostics, day surgery and outpatients facilities closer to
where people live and work.

We shall continue to encourage innovation and reform through the
use of the independent sector to add capacity to, and drive contestabil-
ity within, the NHS. We have already commissioned 460,000 opera-
tions from the independent sector, which will all be delivered free —
with equal access for all based on need, not the ability to pay.

Whenever NHS patients need new capacity for their healthcare, we
will ensure that it is provided from whatever source.

& Empowering patients: choosing not waiting

One principle underpins our reforms — putting patients centre stage.
And extending patient power and choice is crucial to achieving this.
We shall be embedding both throughout the NHS. So:

* By the end of 2008, patients whose GPs refer them for an operation will
be able to choose from any hospital that can provide that operation to
NHS medical and financial standards. There will be the choice of a con-
venient time and place for a non-urgent operation for example a location
close to relatives.

*We will expand capacity and choice in primary care too. Where GPs’ lists
are full we will expand provision by encouraging entrepreneurial GPs
and other providers to expand into that location.

* By 2009 all women will have choice over where and how they have their
baby and what pain relief to use. We want every woman to be supported
by the same midwife throughout her pregnancy. Support will be linked
closely to other services that will be provided in Children’s Centres.

* In order to increase choices for patients with cancer we will double the

63

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

investment going into palliative care services, giving more people the

choice to be treated at home.

By October 2005 we will have recruited more than 1,000 new NHS
dentists and will have increased the number of dental school places by
25 per cent. We will undertake a fundamental review of the scope and
resourcing of NHS dentistry.

We will provide more information and advice. Through NHS Direct,
Health Direct, interactive TV, print media and the internet we will give
more convenient access to much better information about health and
health services, including the performance of doctors and hospitals.

@ Empowering patients:

long-term conditions and social care

We will promote the integration of health and social care at local level,
so that older people and those with long-term conditions can retain
their independence. We will continue to provide healthcare free in
long-term care establishments, and provide the right framework for
schemes such as equity release which make staying at home an attrac-
tive option. We will develop our policy of community matrons for those
with severe conditions, helping to keep people out of hospital by pro-
viding better care at home.

*We will develop personalised budgets in social care where people can decide
Sor themselves what they need and how it should be provided.

*Wée shall extend case-management for the 18 million people with long-term
conditions. We will treble the investment in the Expert Patients Programme,
and help many more patients take control of their own care plans.

* Almost a third of people attending GP surgeries have mental health prob-
lems and mental health occupies approximately one third of a GP’s time.
So we will continue to invest in and improve our services for people with

mental health problems at primary and secondary levels, including

64

Our NHS: Free to all, personal to each

behavioural as well as drug therapies.

*We shall provide safeguards for the few people with long-term mental
health problems who need compulsory treatment coupled with appropri-
ate protection for the public. We shall also strengthen the system for protect-
ing the public from offenders who have served their sentence but may still

pose a threat because they have a serious psychopathic disorder.

§ Living healthier lives

People want to take responsibility for their own health outside the
NHS as well as within it. They have the right to expect help from gov-
ernment. The killer diseases of the heart and the many forms of cancer
are often the product of poor diet, lack of exercise and above all smok-
ing. By 2010 we aim to reduce deaths from coronary heart disease and
strokes by 40 per cent from 1997. And we want death rates from can-
cer to be cut by 20 per cent.

® Healthy choices for children

We will start the drive for better health early — at school. We have
already extended the provision of free fruit to all 4- to 6-year-olds at
school. We will invest more in renovating and building new kitchens as
well as investing an extra £210 million in school meals, guaranteeing
that at least SOp per meal is spent on ingredients in primary schools,
and at least 60p in secondary schools. We are introducing an inde-
pendent School Food Trust, better training for dinner ladies and
Ofsted inspection of healthy eating. We will legislate for tougher stan-
dards of nutrition for school meals and will encourage schools to teach
more about healthy eating. We will ban certain products that are high
in fat/salt content from school meals and ensure that fresh fruit and
vegetables are part of every school meal. We will encourage secondary
schools to keep pupils on the premises to ensure that they have a

 

healthy meal. We will ensure that all school children have access to a

school nurse.

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

® Healthy choices for all

We will put in place a simple system of labelling to make it easier for
busy shoppers to see at a glance how individual foods contribute to a
healthy balanced diet. We will help parents by restricting further the
advertising and promotion to children of those foods and drinks that
are high in fat, salt and sugar.

We recognise that many people want smoke-free environments and
need regulation to help them get this. We therefore intend to shift the
balance significantly in their favour. We will legislate to ensure that all
enclosed public places and workplaces other than licensed premises
will be smoke-free. The legislation will ensure that all restaurants will

 

be smoke-free; all pubs and bars preparing and serving food will be
smoke-free; and other pubs and bars will be free to choose whether to
allow smoking or to be smoke-free. In membership clubs the members

 

will be free to choose whether to allow smoking or to be smoke-free.

 

However, whatever the general status, to protect employees, smoking

 

in the bar area will be prohibited everywhere.

These restrictions will be accompanied by an expansion of NHS
smoking cessation services to encourage and support smokers to
improve their own health by giving up smoking

Starting with the poorest areas of the country we will introduce health
trainers to help people maintain their healthy choices. By 2010,
through this activity we plan to reduce the health inequalities that exist
between rich and poor.

All this will be free at the point of need.
The choice for 2010

Today’s Conservatives want to do what not even Margaret
Thatcher would countenance — introducing charges for hospital

operations so that those who can afford to pay thousands of
pounds can push ahead of those who cannot. As well as ending
the founding principle of the health service, this would take
more than f1 billion out of the system to subsidise those who
can afford to pay. For the rest of us, the Tories would abandon
waiting-list targets and allow a return to the 18-month waits
that were their NHS legacy. The choice is forward with new
Labour to a health system with patients in the driving seat, free
to all and personal to each of us. Or back with the Tories to longer
waits, and to a health system where treatment depends not on
your condition but on your bank balance.

68

Britain forward not back

Our priority since 1997 has been to tackle pensioner poverty.
Nearly two million pensioners have been lifted out of absolute
poverty as a result of Labour’s measures, which are now get-
ting on average an extra £2,000 a year to the poorest third. Our
priorities now are to build a national consensus for tomor-
row’s pensioners, combining public and private pension
schemes to build security in retirement, and to extend the
quality of life of older people.

@ The new Labour case

By 2020 there will be more people over the age of 80 than under the
age of five. For a progressive government there can be no compromise
of our duty to today’s pensioners. But while we fulfil that duty we must
also see old age as a time of independence and opportunity. On pen-
sions, our aim is a system that provides security and decency for all,
which encourages and rewards saving, and is financially sustainable.
And because, more than anything, people need certainty to plan for
the future we will seek a national consensus — cross-party, cross-gener-
ation — for long-term reform.

§ Tackling pensioner poverty:

The success of the Pension Credit

In 1997, 2.8 million pensioners were living in poverty — with the poor-
est expected to live on just £69 per week. Labour’s Pension Credit
now means that no pensioner need live on less than £109 per week. It
rewards saving and helps over three million pensioners, with women in
particular benefiting. We will increase Pension Credit in line with earn-
ings up to and including 2007-08.

All pensioners have benefited from improved universal benefits like
the state pension, the Winter Fuel Payment (now worth £300 per year
for the over-80s), help with council tax and free TV licences for the
over-75s. This year, all households expected to pay council tax that

69

‘On pensions, our aim
1s a system that provides
security and decency for

all, which encourages and
rewards saving, and 1s

financially sustainable.’

Older people: Secure today, prepared for the future

include anyone over 65 will receive £200 towards the cost of council
tax, and the following year there will be free, off-peak local bus travel in
England for the over-60s.

Millions of pensioners have benefited from our fuel poverty pro-
gramme. Our goal is to eliminate fuel poverty for vulnerable groups by
2010, and for all by 2015.

Pensions for the generation of tomorrow

The generation retiring in the future will be different in many ways
from its predecessors. Their jobs will have been different; the expecta-
tions of women will be transformed; their retirements will be longer and
healthier. We have begun to lay the foundations for the pensions system
of tomorrow, for example, by: introducing the State Second Pension to
ensure carers, low earners and disabled people have a chance to build
up a decent pension for the first time; encouraging automatic enrol-
ment into company pension schemes; creating the Pension Protection
Fund; enabling pensioners for the first time to work part time and draw
down their occupational pension; as well as offering an increased state
pension or lump sum for those deferring their pension. We will work to
increase the proportion of pension fund trustees nominated by scheme
members, along with access to proper training. We will keep this issue
under review, with consultation in the expectation of further progress
to 50 per cent member-nominated trustees.

We need to forge a national consensus about how we move from a
pension system designed for today’s pension problems to one that is
right for tomorrow’s. We appointed the Pensions Commission to look
into the future of pensions and its second report is due in autumn
2005. We are clear about the goals of a reformed system. It must tack-
le poverty, provide everyone with the opportunity to build an adequate
retirement income, and be affordable, fair and simple to understand.
In particular it must address the disadvantages faced by women.

71

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

@ New rights, new choices

Many older people want to carry on working in their 50s and 60s. The
welfare state should be there to help them. Older people with their
skills and experience are potentially an enormous resource. That is
why we set up the New Deal for the Over-50s, with over 150,000 older
people helped back to work.

We also need to put the force of the law on the side of older people
who wish to continue working. Companies will no longer be able to
force people to retire before the age of 65 except where specifically
justified. All employees over the age of 65 will have the right to request
of their employer that they be allowed to carry on working. After five
years we will review whether there should be any fixed retirement ages.

‘,..provide everyone with the
opportunity to build an adequate

retirement income, and be affordable,

fair and simple to understand,’

We will give older people greater choice over their care. For every older
person receiving care or other support, we want to offer transparent,
individual budgets which bring funding for a range of services, includ-
ing social care, care homes, and housing support such as adaptations,
maintenance and cleaners together in one place. We will pilot individ-
ual budgets for older people by the end of this year.

We will make the most of the opportunities of an older population by
creating a new programme for older people to be mentors and

72

Older people: Secure today, prepared for the future

coaches to gifted and talented young people. We will also work with
voluntary organisations to help expand grandparent and toddler
groups across the country.

@ Support across the generations

The challenge of balancing work and family applies to parents but also
to people looking after an elderly or sick relative — now one in five
adults. Since the introduction of the right to request from their
employer flexible working arrangements, a million parents have
changed their working hours. We are consulting on a similar right for
carers of elderly or sick relatives.

The choice for 2010

The Tories are the party of pensioner poverty. When they left
office in 1997, one in four pensioners was living in poverty and
the poorest pensioners were expected to get by on just £69 a
week. They would phase out the Pension Credit and abolish the
State Second Pension, hurting most those most in need. When
the one thing we all need is certainty, the Tories have admitted
they have absolutely no plans for how to fund their pensions pol-
icy beyond four years. The choice is whether we go forward with
new Labour with today’s pensioners provided for and poverty
falling, a national consensus on fair and sustainable long-term
reform and the policies to give older people enhanced rights and
choices. Or back with the Tories to rising levels of pensioner
poverty and unending insecurity for tomorrow’s pensioners.

Britain forward not back

It is impossible to fulfil the potential of our country —- never
mind promoting social mobility and equality of life chances —
unless every child gets the best possible start in life.
Government does not bring up children, but it must support
parents in their key role. We will help parents balance work
and family, expand paid leave, deliver the biggest ever expan-
sion in childcare and end child poverty in a generation.

@ The new Labour case

Strong families are the bedrock of a strong society. Children cannot be
the forgotten constituency of politics; parents put their children first
and they deserve support from government. Yet fear of seeming to
‘nanny’ has in the past meant British law and culture have not sup-
ported parents and children. Government cannot shirk its responsibil-
ities. Our starting point is that for children to come first parents need
to be given choices: a tax and benefit system to raise family incomes
and tackle child poverty; legal changes to promote a healthy balance
between work and family; and services built around the needs of chil-
dren. Our third-term commitment — not a nanny state but a family-
friendly government.

& Tackling child poverty
We will end child poverty, starting by halving it — both in terms of rel-
ative low-income and in terms of material deprivation — by 2010-11.

Work is the best anti-poverty strategy. Tailored help, especially for lone
parents, is key but we are also committed to making work pay — with a
guaranteed income of at least £258 per week for those with children
and in full-time work.

The benefits system needs to support all children, and those in great-
est need the most. That is the rationale for universal child benefit and

targeted tax credits, and why we have committed to increasing the

75

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

Child Tax Credit at least in line with earnings up to and including
2007-08. By October 2005, families with children will be on average
£1,400 per year better off, and those in the poorest fifth of the popu-
lation on average £3,200 a year better off compared to 1997. Labour’s
Child Trust Fund creates a nest egg for newborns that they can access
at age 18. It is the world’s first example of a government ensuring that
all children grow up with a financial stake. We are determined to see it
grow and are consulting on making payments at age seven and at sec-
ondary school age, in addition to those made at birth.

‘Over 350,000 mothers and 80,000
fathers each year are using new rights to

paid maternity and paternity leave.’

We are supporting local authorities in the radical reform of children’s
services, above all to ensure there is one professional with lead
responsibility for each vulnerable child. We will also ensure that serv-
ices are designed to meet the additional needs of disabled children
and their families.

@ Universal childcare

Since 1997, the Government has funded an additional 520,000
sustainable childcare places and now every family with a three- or
four- year-old child has access to a free nursery place. By 2010, we will
create 3,500 Sure Start Children’s Centres for children under five
years — five in every constituency —a universal local service that brings
together childcare and services for families. By 2010, all parents of
three- and four-year-olds will have increased rights to flexible, free,
part-time nursery provision for 15 hours a week over the whole school

76

Families: Choice and support at work and at home

year. Over the longer term we will increase free provision to 20 hours.

For older children up to the age of 14 extended schools, working in
partnership with the private and voluntary sectors, will offer afford-
able out-of-school childcare from 8am to 6pm throughout the year,
with a range of arts, music, sport and study support.

We will help families with incomes of up to £59,000 a year with their
childcare costs through more generous Working Tax Credit, including
help for those using a nanny or au pair. Parents using childcare sup-
ported by their employer will be able to get a tax break worth up to
£50 a week each. We are working with the GLA and the Mayor to
bring down the cost of childcare in London.

® Creating time

Over 350,000 mothers and 80,000 fathers each year are using new
rights to paid maternity and paternity leave. Parents consistently say
their top priority is more choice of whether to stay at home with their
baby in the first year of its life. We will therefore increase paid materni-
ty leave to nine months from 2007 — worth an extra £1,400 — with the
goal of achieving a year’s paid leave by the end of the Parliament while
simplifying the system for employers. We want to give fathers more
opportunities to spend time with their children, and are consulting on
how best to do this including the option of sharing paid leave. We have
already introduced the right to request flexible working to parents of
children under six and nearly a million parents have benefited. We
need to balance the needs of parents and carers, with those of employ-
ers, especially small businesses. We are consulting on extending the
right to request flexible working to carers of sick and disabled adults as
a priority, and also on whether we should extend the right to parents of
older children.

77

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

& Supporting family life

Common sense, as well as research, says that children need to be able
to depend on the love and support of both parents. The financial sup-
port we are giving families, along with new rights to flexible working
and access to childcare, are all designed to support family life.
Government can and should support those public and voluntary agen-
cies that support families and parents. We are examining the develop-
ment of a new information service — Parents Direct — to provide advice
on all aspects of children’s services and parental entitlements.

For those parents who do separate or divorce, both have a responsibil-
ity for a meaningful relationship with their children where that is safe.
We are introducing reforms to minimise conflict and encourage con-
ciliation by greater and early use of mediation. We stand by the princi-
ple that absent parents should make a fair contribution to the cost of
the upkeep of their children, and we are committed to tackling the
backlog of Child Support Agency claims as efficiently and fairly as
possible. We also need to ensure court orders on access are enforced
according to the best interests of the child, which ideally gives both
parents an important role.

& Increasing home ownership

A decent home is crucial to family well-being. Homeownership has
increased by over one million with Labour and by the end of our third
term we aim for it to have risen by another million to two million.
Rising house prices in many areas of the country have made it difficult
for people on lower incomes to get a foot on the housing ladder. So we
have raised the stamp duty threshold from £60,000 to £120,000 for
residential properties, exempting an extra 300,000 homebuyers from
stamp duty every year.

We will continue to respond to the challenges of local housing markets
across the UK. In the South we will invest in extra housing in London

78

‘Children cannot be
the forgotten constituency
of politics; parents put
their children first and
they deserve support

from government.

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

and the wider South East, with particular emphasis on the Thames
Gateway and other growth areas. In the Midlands and North we will
tackle the problems of low demand and abandonment that threaten
communities.

We want to widen the opportunity to own or part-own, especially for
more young people and those tenants who rent in the private or pub-
lic sector. Our comprehensive plan includes:

*A new Homebuy scheme offering up to 300,000 council and housing
association tenants the opportunity to buy part of their home, increasing
their equity over time if they wish.

*A First Time Buyers Initiative to help over 15,000 first-time buyers who
could not own or part-own a home without extra help. We will use surplus
public land for new homes, enabling the buyer to take out a mortgage for
only the building.

* Strengthening existing home ownership schemes, such as the Key Worker

Living scheme and Shared Ownership.

® Social housing
The increased supply and quality of social housing is central to
Labour’s belief in mixed, sustainable communities.

Since 1997, we have cut the number of substandard social-rented
homes by one million; installing 300,000 new kitchens, 220,000 new
bathrooms and 720,000 new boilers and central heating systems into
council homes. By 2010 we will ensure that all social tenants benefit
from a decent, warm home with modern facilities.

For too long, tenants have had little say over where they live. In a third
term, Labour will offer greater flexibility and choice for those who
rent. We will increase the annual supply of new social homes by 50 per
cent by 2008, an extra 10,000 homes a year, and give local authorities

80

Families: Choice and support at work and at home

the ability to start building homes again and bring empty homes back
into use. And we will end the ‘take it or leave it approach to social rent-
ing by expanding choice-based lettings nationwide.

The choice for 2010

The Tories are all talk and no action on family policy. They
opposed our increases in maternity and paternity pay and the
introduction of flexible working rights. Even the measures they
have proposed wouldn’t come in until 2009, by which time the
Tories are committed to making deep cuts in spending. The
choice is forward with new Labour to a universal, affordable,
good-quality childcare, a million more homeowners, more
choice for all parents and an end to child poverty. Or back to the
risky economic policies of a Tory government that would let
families sink or swim whatever the pressures they face.

82

Britain forward not back

Globalisation means that events elsewhere have a direct
impact at home. So we will pursue British interests by work-
ing with our allies to make the world a safer, fairer place. This
means reforming Europe. It means fighting terrorism and
stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction. It means
modernising our armed forces. And it means using our lead-
ing role in the G8, EU, the Commonwealth and UN to pro-
mote global action on climate change and poverty.

@ The new Labour case

Domestic interests and international action are entwined more than
ever before. Action on drugs, terrorism, people trafficking, AIDS, cli-
mate change, poverty, migration and trade all require us to work with
other countries and through international organisations. The best
defence of our security at home is the spread of liberty and justice
overseas. In a third term we will secure Britain’s place in the EU and at
the heart of international decision-making. We will always uphold the
rule of international law.

® Making Europe work better for Britain

We are proud of Britain’s EU membership and of the strong position
Britain has achieved within Europe. British membership of the EU
brings jobs, trade and prosperity; it boosts environmental standards,
social protection and international clout. Since 1997 we have gone
from marginal players, often ignored, to leaders in the European
Union. Working hard with Labour MEPs, we are determined to
remain leaders. Outside the EU, or on its margins, we would unques-
tionably be weaker and more vulnerable.

The EU now has 25 members and will continue to expand. The new
Constitutional Treaty ensures the new Europe can work effectively,
and that Britain keeps control of key national interests like foreign pol-
icy, taxation, social security and defence. The Treaty sets out what the

83

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

EU can do and what it cannot. It strengthens the voice of national par-
liaments and governments in EU affairs. It is a good treaty for Britain
and for the new Europe. We will put it to the British people in a refer-
endum and campaign whole-heartedly for a “Yes’ vote to keep Britain
a leading nation in Europe.

We will also work to reform Europe. During Britain’s EU presidency
this year, we will work to promote economic reform, bear down on
regulation; make progress in the Doha development trade round; bring
closer EU membership for Turkey, the Balkans and Eastern Europe;
and improve the focus and quality of EU aid so it better helps the poor-
est countries.

We will continue to lead European defence cooperation. We will build
stronger EU defence capabilities, in harmony with NATO - the cor-
nerstone of our defence policy — without compromising our national
ability to act independently. We will ensure the new EU battle groups
are equipped and organised to act quickly to save lives in humanitari-
an crises.

On the euro, we maintain our common-sense policy. The determining
factor underpinning any government decision is the national econom-
ic interest and whether the case for joining is clear and unambiguous.
The five economic tests must be met before any decision to join can be
made. If the Government were to recommend joining, it would be put
to a vote in Parliament and a referendum of the British people.

® Protecting British interests and British citizens abroad
We will continue to provide effective support to British businesses and
trade unions abroad, and we will continue to improve our ability to
respond quickly to international crises and disasters which affect our
citizens. The Foreign Office already provides a wide range of services
for British people in difficulty overseas, and we will consult widely

84

International policy

before drawing up a comprehensive statement spelling out the rights
and responsibilities of British travellers abroad. This will include the
help that people can expect from their government in times of need.

@ Helping make you more secure

We have worked closely with the US and other nations to combat the
threat of terrorism in Afghanistan and in Iraq. The threat of the prolif-
eration of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons — and their use by
rogue states or terrorist groups — is a pressing issue for the world today.
We have worked with the US to ensure that Libya has given up its
WMD, and we will continue with France and Germany to ensure that
Iran does not develop nuclear weapons. In North Korea we will sup-
port the multilateral approach of the Six Parties talks. We will continue
to strongly support the peace process between India and Pakistan, and
back moves to resolve the long-running dispute over Kashmir. And we
will work to put an end to the international network of trade in
weapons of mass destruction. Labour has already introduced a strict
regime to control the export of conventional weapons, and we led
moves for EU-wide measures. We will work actively to secure an inter-

 

national treaty on the arms trade.

® Promoting human rights, peace and democracy

We need to be tough on terrorism and its causes. The threat of terror-
ism and the danger to British citizens is proven, not just by September
11th but by repeated attacks in Europe and around the world. So we
cannot sit back and hope that we will be unaffected. It is right that we
do everything in our power to disrupt terrorist networks, and to chal-
lenge the conditions that help terrorism to breed.

The UN Charter proclaims the universal principles of human rights
and democr:

 

ry. In an uncertain world they are not only right in

principle, they are important guarantees of our national security and
prosperity too.

International policy

There have been major strides forward in recent years: in Indonesia,
Afghanistan and many parts of Africa and Latin America, democracy
is being extended.

We mourn the loss of life of innocent civilians and coalition forces in
the war in Iraq and the subsequent terrorism. But the butchery of
Saddam is over and across Iraq, eight million people risked their lives
to vote earlier this year. Many people disagreed with the action we took
in Iraq. We respect and understand their views. But we should all now
unite to support the fledgling democracy in Iraq. British troops should
remain in Iraq under a United Nations mandate as long as the demo-
cratically elected government there wants them. They will continue to
train Iraqi security forces to take responsibility for their own future.

We welcome the wider process of democratic reform across the
Middle East, and we will work with our allies to encourage and pro-
mote economic and political change.

We strongly support the peace process between Israel and Palestine.
Resolution of the conflict is crucial to peace in the region and the wider
world. The conference held in London in March 2005 has started the
process of helping a democratic government in Palestine build securi-
ty and prosperity. We will work tirelessly to bring about a peace settle-
ment in which a viable and independent state of Palestine lives
alongside a safe and secure Israel.

@ Supporting our armed forces

Britain’s armed forces are among the best in the world. They are able
to play a key role in advancing our interests and values. We want to
keep it that way.

We are immensely proud of the bravery, skill and dedication our armed.
forces have demonstrated in Afghanistan, Iraq, Sierra Leone, the

87

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

Balkans and elsewhere across the world. They are a force for good. We
will never commit forces to battle unless it is essential; but when they
are committed they will have the investment, strategy, training and
preparation they need. That is one reason we have given the armed
forces the biggest sustained increase in funding since the end of the
Cold War. But we also know that modern demands on our armed
forces are changing. That is why reform and modernisation are essen-
tial. A reduction in the number of infantry battalions, made possible
because of the improved security situation in Northern Ireland, has
allowed extra resources for the vital support services such as signals,
engineers, intelligence and logistics units — the parts of the army most
under pressure. This is essential to allow our infantry soldiers to be
fully supported when they go into action on our behalf. We will contin-
ue with the investment and reform that make our fighting forces the
most flexible and effective in the world.

We are also committed to retaining the independent nuclear deterrent
and we will continue to work, both bilaterally and through the UN, to
urge states not yet party to non-proliferation treaties, notably the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to join.

@ Veterans

Labour has always recognised the sacrifice and bravery of our service-
men and women. That is why we were the first government to appoint
a Minister for Veterans Affairs. This has enabled us to put veterans’
affairs at the heart of decision-making at the Ministry of Defence.
Labour has also put more money than ever before into veterans’ issues,
including £27 million of Lottery funding over the last two years. We
will continue to give priority to veterans’ affairs as we mark 60 years
since the end of the Second World War.

@ Reforming the United Nations
The UN is crucial to our efforts to build a more secure and more

88

International policy

prosperous world. We support the reform of the Security Council so it
becomes more representative and has a stronger focus on conflict pre-
vention. We support the recommendation of the Secretary-General’s
High-level Panel for a Peace-building Commission to assist countries
emerging from conflict and to develop mechanisms to enhance con-
flict prevention. We will press for more radical reform of the UN
humanitarian system, so it is better equipped to saves lives. We will also
press for reform of the World Bank and IMF to improve transparency,
give more say to developing countries and, with the EU better focus
their efforts on the poorest countries, particularly in Africa.

® Climate change and Africa
Britain has the chair of the G8 this year. We will use the summit for two
particular purposes.

First, climate change is the one of the most pressing challenges that the
world faces. We will continue to lead internationally on climate change,
and to strive for wider acceptance of the science and the steps needed
to combat the problem. We will look beyond Kyoto and promote an
international dialogue to reach agreement on the long-term goals and
action needed to stabilise the level of greenhouse gases in the atmos-
phere. We will also work for effective international action to adapt to
the impacts of climate change.

The UK has already met its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. We
remain committed to achieving a 20 per cent reduction in carbon diox-
ide emissions on 1990 levels by 2010, and our review of progress this
summer will show us how to get back on track. A 60 per cent reduction
by 2050 remains necessary and achievable.

We will continue to promote and develop renewable energy sources, to
seek high standards of energy efficiency in the public and private sec-

tors, and to support emissions trading in Europe and beyond.

89

The Labour Party manifesto 2005
Secondly we will focus on Africa and the global fight against poverty.

We have more than doubled aid since 1997. We have cancelled the
debts of the poorest countries and are now pushing others to follow
our lead and offer 100 per cent debt relief for the poorest. We are proud
to have established a Department for International Development, with
a clear mission to reduce poverty. Now, for the first time ever the UK
has a clear timetable — 2013 — for achieving the UN target of 0.7 per
cent of national income devoted to development. Globally we are
pressing for a doubling of aid backed by getting international agree-
ment to an International Finance Facility as supported by the
Commission for Africa.

But aid will not be successful without conflict prevention, good gover-
nance and zero tolerance of corruption. We will work for faster repatri-
ation of stolen assets from UK financial institutions, ratification of the
UN Convention on corruption, and more open and accountable
reporting of revenues from oil and mining — that so often fuel local
conflicts. Our commitment is to the people of the developing world;
our contract is with their governments for reform. But if poor coun-
tries are committed to good governance and poverty reduction we
then believe they should be in control of their own policies. We will end
the practice of making aid conditional on sensitive economic policy
choices, such as trade liberalisation and privatisation.

With this leadership and extra money, we can now work to ensure all
children go to school, and millions of people in Asia and Africa suffer-
ing from AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have access to treatment. In
particular, we will press for an international agreement on universal
access to AIDS treatment by 2010 and for all people in poor countries
to have access to free basic healthcare and education.

Our long-term aim is to help lift a billion people out of poverty.

90

International policy

§ Fair trade

We also know that without fairer trade rules and private investment,
poor countries will not generate the growth needed to lift themselves
out of poverty. We will press for the conclusion of an ambitious trade
deal that will completely open markets to exports from poorer coun-
tries; for further reform of rich countries’ agricultural subsidies,
including the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy and a 2010 timetable
to end agricultural export subsidies. We do not believe poor countries
should be forced to liberalise. We will allow them to sequence their
trade reforms, so they can build their capacity to compete globally.

The choice for 2010

In 1997 the Tories had left Britain isolated in Europe, overseas
aid had declined and we lacked any coherent vision of our place
in the world. With Labour, a strong Britain will force interna-
tional terrorism into retreat and help spread democracy and
freedom around the world. We will be leaders in a reformed
Europe, and, with others, make significant progress towards
raising a billion people out of extreme poverty. We will fight for a
new global agreement on climate change, an arms trade treaty,
and a trade deal that makes trade work for the many, not just
the few. Our armed forces will continue to be the best in the
world. The alternative is to go back to the Tories with their record
of cuts in aid and defence and their policies of tearing up
the Social Chapter, and marginalising Britain in Europe and
the world.

Britain forward not back

Arts, culture and sport are thriving around Britain - enrich-
ing individual lives and transforming communities, towns and
cities. They are important in their own right - as nourishment
for our imagination or a source of plain enjoyment and our
local environment should be a source of pride. We will work to
improve the quality of life of every community in Britain.

@ The new Labour case

We believe in the inherent value of arts, culture and sport. Our towns
and cities are being energised by sports and culture and as they are
regenerated the quality of life for all is transformed. As we build on this
change, our progressive challenge is to broaden participation as widely
as possible, making the links between sport and health, and culture and
well-being. We must combine the broadest base of participation with
the ability for the most talented to progress to the very top. Our third
term will embed the expectation that every child and every adult have
the maximum chance to develop their creative or sporting talents.

i Creative cities

Art and culture are valuable for their own sake; they are also crucial to
our national prosperity. Britain’s cultural industries now make up over
eight per cent of our national income; and from computer games to
the fine arts, British talent is gaining global recognition and generating
real wealth. This is one of the fastest growing and fastest changing
areas of the economy. And the transformation of our great cities is, in
great part, a story of culture-led regeneration. We are proud of the
record of Labour-led councils in leading this transformation, from
Gateshead to Greenwich.

To help young talent get the right start we will work to establish
Creative Apprenticeships. Through the National Endowment for
Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA) we are funding the
Creative Pioneer Academy which will develop the entrepreneurial

93

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

skills of recent graduates with outstanding talents and original busi-
ness ideas — and for some there will be the offer of up to £35,000 to
start their own business.

From 2006 we will provide £12 million over two years to the Arts
Council England to promote leadership and management in the cul-
tural sector. We want to invest in high-flyers developing commercial
and business skills, encourage the talents of leading ethnic minority
figures and improve the links between arts and business.

§ Arts, culture and museums

Since 1997 we have increased funding for the arts by 73 per cent in
real terms. We will continue to support our finest artists and institu-
tions to achieve world-class standards.

Thanks to our policy of free admissions the number of people visiting
formerly charging national museums and galleries has risen by 75 per
cent over three years. Many are first-time visitors, with the biggest
increases among children.

Victorian City leaders left us a legacy of great local and regional muse-
ums, and through our investment programme ‘Renaissance in the
Regions’, we are re-creating them as centres of excellence. By 2008 we
will have invested £147 million in partnerships across the country,
modernising museum collections, broadening access to new audiences
and providing a comprehensive service to schools. We will explore fur-
ther ways to encourage philanthropy to boost the quality of our public
art collections.

We will legislate, as soon as time allows, to implement the findings of

the Heritage Protection Review, which allows the public a greater say
in listing decisions.

94

Quality of life: Excellence for all

Creative Sparks

Our aim is that everyone should have the opportunity to participate in
cultural life, and we want that involvement to start as early as possible.
Creative Partnerships, our programme of support for art in schools in
our most disadvantaged areas, has already reached over 150,000 chil-
dren. We will build on this approach by rolling out our new programme
Creative Sparks to guarantee that all children and young people will be
given the chance to experience the very best of culture every year.

& Sport for all

Our aim is to increase participation in sport year on year. Central to
this is having modern, high-quality facilities close to where people live.
£1.5 billion is being invested in sports facilities in every community.

 

By 2008 our aim is that almost everyone will be within 20 minutes of a
good multi-sport facility.

Grassroots clubs are the lifeblood of sports in Britain, and week in,
week out, they are sustained by an army of volunteers. Reform of Sport
England will continue, to reduce overheads and ensure that more
money reaches the grassroots. We have put sports clubs at the fore-
front of our investment plans with the £100 million Community Club
Development Scheme and mandatory rate relief at 80 per cent for reg-
istered Community Amateur Sports Clubs already worth about £5
million. As we review the operation of the new licensing regime we will
ensure that there is not an unfair burden on local community groups,
including sports clubs.

Investment in school sports will ensure that by 2010 all children will
receive two hours high-quality PE or sport per week. Building on that,
we pledge that by 2010 every child who wants it will have access to a
further two to three hours sport per week.

Every child should have the chance to compete at school. We have

95

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

clamped down on the sale of playing fields: 96 per cent of schools in
School Sport Partnerships now hold at least one sports day or sports
festival each year. All secondary schools will be expected to field teams
in regular competitive fixtures. We will also establish individual and
team rankings in all the main sports, with clear and transparent suc-
cess criteria.

& Sport in the community

‘To make it easier to get access to sports in your local area we will estab-
lish Sport Direct — a single point of access for sports in the UK. One
website and one phone number will help you find out what’s going on
in your area. Together with £155 million from the Big Lottery Fund,
the Government will ensure that children who have had little access to
play facilities and those with a disability have much better access to
safe, modern playgrounds.

Building on the lessons of the Football Foundation, we will develop a
National Sports Foundation to bring resources from the private and
voluntary sectors together with public money to invest in grassroots
sporting facilities. We will work with the Premier League and the FA to
find innovative ways of assisting community sport, including
Supporters Direct. Having passed the necessary legislation, we remain
committed to completing the sale of the Tote to a Racing Trust.

i The Olympics

Britain’s medal hauls at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and in Athens in
2004 were the best for over 80 years, and we maintained our position
as one of the leading nations in the Paralympics. Now we are support-
ing the bid to bring the Olympics to London in 2012. Our plans would
bring regeneration to the East End of London and will leave lasting
sporting, economic and cultural legacies. As we approach the
Olympics we will continue to invest in elite athletes through the
Talented Athlete Scholarship Scheme for young athletes. In addition

96

‘Our towns and cities
are being energised by
sports and culture and
as they are regenerated

the quality of life for

all 1s transformed.’

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

we have launched 2012 Scholarships worth around £10,000 a year
each for our most talented 12- to 18-year-olds.

§§ Libraries in the information age

Where they offer new services like childcare, after-school education
for pupils, and IT learning our libraries are successful. We will develop
a strategy for the modernisation of our libraries which builds on the
best, strengthens library leadership, sharpens customer focus and har-
nesses local popular support. We will encourage further cooperation in
back-office functions and identify the best ways to improve our library
infrastructure.

™ Public service broadcasting and the BBC

We support a strong, independent and world-class BBC with clearly
defined public purposes at the heart of a healthy public broadcasting
system. We will replace the BBC Governors with a BBC Trust to
ensure that the BBC’s governance and regulation is accountable to the
licence-fee payers to whom it belongs. The licence fee will be guaran-
teed for the whole of the ten-year Royal Charter that will take effect on
1 January 2007. Channel 4 will continue to be a publicly owned broad-
caster providing distinctive competition to the BBC. ITV and Five will
also be retained in our public service broadcasting system.

§& Digital switchover

The success of satelite and cable television in driving take-up of digital
shows how changes in technology bring real benefits — in terms of
greater choice, and increasingly, in access to services. Our aim is to
make those benefits available to all. We will achieve digital switchover
between 2008 and 2012 ensuring universal access to high-quality,
free-to-view and subscription digital TV. This will happen region by
region, and we will make sure that the interests of elderly people and
other vulnerable groups are protected.

98

Quality of life: Excellence for all

§ Digital challenge
We will deliver our cross-government strategy for closing the digital
divide and using ICT to further transform public services:

* By 2006 every school supported to offer all pupils access to computers at
home.

*A Digital Challenge for a local authority to be a national and interna-
tional pathfinder in universal digital service provision.

*A new National Internet Safety Unit to make Britain the safest place in

the world to access the internet.

® Copyright in a digital age

We will modernise copyright and other forms of protection of intellec-
tual property rights so that they are appropriate for the digital age. We
will use our presidency of the EU to look at how to ensure content cre-
ators can protect their innovations in a digital age. Piracy is a growing
threat and we will work with industry to protect against it.

Film

The strength of Britain’s film industry is a source of pride, and
employment. We will continue to make the UK the right place to invest
in film production. We will legislate to provide new tax reliefs that will
ensure support is delivered directly and efficiently to those who pro-
duce films.

 

We will work with the UK Film Council to achieve a higher priority for
funding film festivals around the country, in particular for the
Edinburgh Film Festival, the oldest in Britain.

i The Lottery

Every single part of British life has been touched by the £15 billion
generated for good causes by the Lottery. Labour has made the Lottery
more inclusive and more in tune with people’s priorities. We have

99

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

created the Big Lottery Fund and given it an explicit mandate to involve
people not just in setting strategy but also in awarding grants. Our
Lottery Bill will give a duty and a power to every Lottery distributor to
involve the public more radically in decision-making at every level.

By the end of 2005 we will put in place a new, national consultation on
the way that the National Lottery good causes proceeds are spent after
the new Lottery Licence is awarded in 2009.

& The local environment
The quality of our local environment is vital to our well-being and our
natural environment is a key part of our national heritage.

The environment starts at the front door, and we have made action to
improve the cleanliness of public spaces and communities a priority.
The 2005 Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act will give local
authorities and regulators the powers they have asked for to tackle lit-
ter, graffiti, abandoned cars, fly-tipping, noise pollution and other
environmental concerns. We will further crack down on environmental
crime, minimising litter, cleaning up graffiti and tackling fly-tipping.
We will extend kerbside collection of at least two types of recyclable
materials to all households in England by 2010. Polluters will have the
opportunity to invest in environmental remediation or new local envi-
ronmental projects rather than just pay fines. Rather than ‘polluter
pays’ this new system would mean the ‘polluter improves’.

Britain’s beaches, rivers and drinking water are now of the highest ever
quality. We have added 30,000 hectares to the green belt while exceed-
ing our target of building 60 per cent of new houses on brownfield
sites. We have established the first National Park in England since the
1950s. To enhance our children’s understanding of the environment
we will give every school student the opportunity to experience out-
of-classroom learning in the natural environment.

100

Quality of life: Excellence for all

All newly developed communities — such as the Thames Gateway
Development — will be built to high environmental standards on issues
such as energy efficiency and water use, and we will develop a clear
plan to minimise the impact of new communities on the environment.
From April 2006, all new homes receiving government funding will
meet the new Code for Sustainable Buildings and we will encourage
local authorities to apply similar standards to private homes.

Through a Marine Act, we will introduce a new framework for the
seas, based on marine spatial planning, that balances conservation,
energy and resource needs. To obtain best value from different uses of
our valuable marine resources, we must maintain and protect the
ecosystems on which they depend.

The choice for 2010

The Tories have always neglected the arts, seeing them as an
easy target for cuts. They do not understand the role that culture
can play in the lives of individuals, in the futures of our towns
and cities, and in the prosperity of our country. The choice is for-
ward with new Labour to more sport in schools, arts for all chil-
dren and young people, and continued investment in culture. Or
back to the Tories and cuts of £207 million across culture, arts
and sport.

102

Britain forward not back

In our first two terms we enshrined a new constitutional set-
tlement between the nations of the United Kingdom. In our
next term we will complete the reform of the House of Lords
so that it is a modern and effective revising Chamber. And we
will devolve more power to local authorities and local com-
munities, giving people real power over the issues that matter
most to them.

@ The new Labour case

Widening access to power is as important as widening access to wealth
and opportunity. National standards are important to ensure fairness.
But the best way to tackle exclusion is to give choice and power to
those left behind. Our political institutions — including our own party —
must engage a population overloaded with information, diverse in its
values and lifestyles, and sceptical of power. However, people are pas-
sionate about politics — when they see it affects them. So our challenge
is to bridge the chasm between government and governed. Our third
term will build upon our unprecedented programme of constitutional
reform embedding a culture of devolved government at the centre and
self-government in our communities.

® Building from the neighbourhood up

People want a sense of control over their own neighbourhood. Not a
new tier of neighbourhood government, but new powers over the
problems that confront them when they step outside their front door —
issues like litter, graffiti and anti-social behaviour. That is why we will
offer neighbourhoods a range of powers from which they can choose,
including:

* New powers for parish councils to deal with anti-social behaviour.
* Powers for local people to trigger action in response to persistent local
problems.

* Community funds for local neighbourhoods to spend on local priorities.

103

‘Widening access to
power is as important as
widening access to wealth
and opportunity. National
standards are important

to ensure fairness.’

Democracy: Power devolved, citizens empowered

* New opportunities for communities to assume greater responsibility or
even ownership of community assets like village halls, community centres,

libraries or recreational facilities.

Good parish councils engage communities and make a real difference,
so we will extend the right to establish parish councils to communities
in London.

A vibrant civil society

We believe that enterprises in the mutual and cooperative sector have
an important role to play in the provision of local services, from health
to education, from leisure to care for the vulnerable. As democratic,
not-for-profit organisations, they can help to involve local people in
shaping the services they want, unleash creativity and innovation, cre-
ate jobs and provide new services — especially in neighbourhoods
where traditional services have failed local people in the past.

We have introduced a new legal form — the Community Interest
Company (CIC) - and want to support new enterprises. As a major
stimulus to this sector, central government and local authorities will
work with these ‘social enterprises’ wherever possible. Where services
can be provided by mutuals, cooperatives or CICs to the required stan-
dards of quality and value for money, they should be positively encour-
aged to develop and be included in procurement policies. We will
discuss with local authorities the best way to achieve this.

Ina range of services the voluntary and community sector has shown
itself to be innovative, efficient and effective. Its potential for service
delivery should be considered on equal terms. We will continue to
improve the context in which the gifting of time and resources to the
voluntary sector takes place. We will reintroduce the widely supported
reforms in the Charities Bill.

105

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

We understand that often the spark for local innovation and change
comes from one or two dedicated, visionary individuals. These people,
sometimes dubbed ‘social entrepreneurs’, deserve our full support.
We will develop a framework of incentives and rewards, to recognise
the special people in every community whose voluntary efforts trans-
form the lives of others.

A better alternative for young people

We know that parents and young people think that there should be
more things to do and places to go for teenagers. We will publish plans
to reform provision in order to ensure that all young people have access
to a wider set of activities after the school day such as sport and the
arts. We are determined that better provision will be allied to a stronger
voice for the young themselves in designing and managing local provi-
sion. We will establish the first ever national framework for youth vol-
unteering, action and engagement — a modern national youth
community service, led by young people themselves — with an invest-
ment over the next three years of up to £100 million with matched
funding from business, the voluntary sector and the Lottery.

™ Councils: more freedom, less bureaucracy

Strong communities ultimately require strong local government. We
will give councils further freedoms to deliver better local services, sub-
ject to minimum national standards, with even greater freedoms for
top-performing councils. We will reduce unnecessary bureaucracy by
cutting both the cost of inspection and the total number of inspec-
torates, and we will dramatically simplify the many funding streams
available to local areas through new Local Area Agreements. We will
also give councils greater stability by providing three-year funding. We
will continue to deliver efficiency savings and improvements to local
services through joint procurement, shared services, streamlining
administrative structures while promoting decision-making at the
level that will make a difference. We will continue to strengthen the

106

Democracy: Power devolved, citizens empowered

community leadership role of local authorities working in partnership
with public, voluntary and private bodies.

® Stronger leadership

Strong local government requires strong leadership. We will ensure
that councils are organised in the most effective way to lead and sup-
port local partnerships and deliver high-quality services. We will
explore giving people a more direct opportunity to express a view
about whether they would like to have a directly elected mayor. We will
also consult with city councils on the powers needed for a new gener-
ation of city mayors. And we will examine the case for simplifying the
current local government election cycle by moving towards ‘whole

council’ elections every four years.

@ Council tax under control

Labour recognises the concerns that have been raised about the level
of council tax. This year we have delivered the lowest council tax
increase in over a decade through a combination of extra investment
and tough action to cap excessive increases.

We will continue to invest in local services with year-on-year increases
in grants to local councils, and will not hesitate to use our capping

powers to protect council taxpayers from excessive rises in council tax.

We remain concerned that many council taxpayers are not claiming
reductions in their council tax bills to which they are already entitled.
We will therefore introduce measures to make it easier for pensioners
and people on low incomes to claim Council Tax Benefit.

In the longer term, we are committed to reforming council tax and will

consider carefully the conclusions of the Lyons Review into local gov-
ernment finance.

107

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

i The nations and regions of the UK

In our first term, we devolved power to Scotland and Wales and
restored city-wide government to London. Britain is stronger as a
result. In the next Parliament, we will decentralise power further. In
Wales we will develop democratic devolution by creating a stronger
Assembly with enhanced legislative powers and a reformed structure
and electoral system to make the exercise of Assembly responsibilities
clearer and more accountable to the public. We will also review the
powers of the London Mayor and the Greater London Authority. And
we will devolve further responsibility to existing regional bodies in
relation to planning, housing, economic development and transport.

@ Northern Ireland

The Belfast Agreement on Good Friday 1998, was a remarkable
achievement. Life in Northern Ireland is immeasurably better as a
result. A huge programme of reform in policing, justice and rights,
together with the lowest ever unemployment has helped address the
inequalities of the past and has created a new confidence.

It is unacceptable that seven years after the agreement there are still
paramilitary groups involved in criminality and punishment attacks.
This has to end. The period of transition is over. Unionist politicians
have made it clear that they are prepared to share power with national-
ists and republicans if violence is ended once and for all. It is time for
all groups in Northern Ireland to make it clear they will only use dem-
ocratic and peaceful means to advance their aims.

We will work tirelessly with the parties in Northern Ireland and with
the Irish government to re-establish the devolved institutions. But this
can only happen on an inclusive basis if the IRA ends paramilitarism
and criminality for good and decommissions its weapons. Bringing
this about so that normal politics can take over in the Province will be
our principal aim.

108

‘The best way to tackle
exclusion 1s to give

choice and power to
those left behind,’

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

Loyalist paramilitary violence and criminality is equally intolerable. We
will ensure that it is dealt with severely while providing the assistance
necessary to Loyalist communities to ensure that prosperity is spread
throughout Northern Ireland.

@ Parliamentary reform

Labour has already taken steps to make the House of Commons more
representative, through all-women shortlists. Labour will also continue
to support reforms that improve parliamentary accountability and
scrutiny led by the successful Modernisation Committee.

In our first term, we ended the absurdity of a House of Lords domi-
nated by hereditary peers. Labour believes that a reformed Upper
Chamber must be effective, legitimate and more representative with-
out challenging the primacy of the House of Commons.

Following a review conducted by a committee of both Houses, we will
seek agreement on codifying the key conventions of the Lords, and
developing alternative forms of scrutiny that complement rather than
replicate those of the Commons; the review should also explore how
the upper chamber might offer a better route for public engagement in
scrutiny and policy-making. We will legislate to place reasonable limits
on the time bills spend in the second chamber — no longer than 60 sit-
ting days for most bills.

As part of the process of modernisation, we will remove the remaining
hereditary peers and allow a free vote on the composition of the
House.

Labour remains committed to reviewing the experience of the new
electoral systems — introduced for the devolved administrations, the
European Parliament and the London Assembly. A referendum
remains the right way to agree any change for Westminster.

110

Democracy: Power devolved, citizens empowered

Having been the first government to take action to clean up the fund-
ing of political parties, we will continue to work with the independent
Electoral Commission to explore how best to support the vital demo-
cratic role of political parties while recognising that campaigning activ-
ity must always be funded by parties from their own resources.

Since 1997 there has been a flowering of innovative forms of public
engagement, for example, the Citizens Council used by the National
Institute for Clinical Excellence to advise on ethical dilemmas. With
the growing importance of new public policy issues and dilemmas —
particularly those arising from scientific advances — we will continue to
explore new and innovative forms of public engagement raising their
profile and status in policy-making.

§ A voice for all

A fully democratic society depends on giving everyone a voice and
stake. Only Labour governments have ever introduced race relations
legislation, and laws passed in 2000 are ensuring that all public bodies
promote diversity and tackle discrimination against black and Asian
Britons. We will continue to promote civil rights for disabled people,
ensuring full implementation of the new positive duty on the public
sector to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people. We will
also introduce a similar duty to promote equality of opportunity
between women and men, and will further extend protection against
discrimination on the grounds of religion and belief. We are commit-
ted to improving the rights and opportunities of gays and lesbians,
that’s why we brought in legislation on civil partnerships, reducing the
age of consent, repealed Section 28 and reformed the sexual offences
legislation so that it was no longer discriminatory.

It remains our firm and clear intention to give people of all faiths the
same protection against incitement to hatred on the basis of their reli-

gion. We will legislate to outlaw it and will continue the dialogue we

111

The Labour Party manifesto 2005

have started with faith groups from all backgrounds about how best to
balance protection, tolerance and free speech.

We are proud to have brought in the Human Rights Act, enabling
British citizens to take action in British courts rather than having to
wait years to seek redress in Strasbourg. But rights must be balanced
by responsibilities. So we will continue to bear down on abusive or
frivolous claims.

In the next Parliament we will establish a Commission on Equality and
Human Rights to promote equality for all and, tackle discrimination,
and introduce a Single Equality Act to modernise and simplify
equality legislation.

The choice for 2010

The Tories have only one policy on democratic reform - oppor-
tunism. Arch centralisers when in office, they now claim to be
localists. Having refused for decades to accept any reform of the
archaic House of Lords, some of them now claim to support
a fully elected House. The choice is forward with new Labour to
modern institutions and more power than ever devolved to
communities and successful local authorities. Or back with
the Tories to a government indifferent to the health of our
democracy and negligent of our institutions.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010

Foreword from Gordon Brown

 

This General Election is fought as our troops
are bravely fighting to defend the safety of the
British people and the security of the world in
Afghanistan. They bring great pride and credit
to our country: we honour and will always
support them.

At the same time the world has been rocked by the
first great crisis of the new global economic age.

In Britain, the political crisis caused by expenses
has undermined the bond of trust between the
people and the politicians elected to serve them.

So this cannot, and will not, be a ‘business as
usual’ election or Manifesto. In this Manifesto we
set out plans to address the main future challenges
we face in our economy, our society and our
politics. We will rebuild the economy to secure
the recovery and invest in future growth and jobs.
We will renew our society to further strengthen
the communities that bind our country together.
And we will restore trust in politics with greater
transparency and accountability in a system
battered by the expenses scandal.

This programme for further national renewal
meets the big challenges of the age. Our
Manifesto is ambitious but affordable, bold but
realistic, and learns from the lessons we take from
our experience to date. Over the next ten years we
will confront major challenges - intensive global
competition, climate change, an ageing society,
and bringing stability to Afghanistan. This is a
moment for good judgement and serious purpose
to meet the challenges ahead.

Our aim is a modern, progressive Britain based on
fairness, respect, decency and openness.

0:2

This is a Manifesto about the greater progressive
change we need because of the tougher times we
are living through. There are no big new spending
commitments, but there is a determination for
every penny to be used wisely, and, as present
plans make clear, to give the maximum protection
to frontline public services.

This is a moment to show greater boldness in
response to what Britain has gone through and

the toll it has taken. We reject a ‘business as usual’
mentality because we have to re-build and re-
balance the economy, as well as renew our society
and politics. Reform cannot stand still — not least
because we need to get more value and delivery
from public services in a period of public spending
constraint. Our Manifesto charts an optimistic
course in tougher economic times. It builds on and
takes forward the reforms we have undertaken
since 1997.

Tlove Britain and want the very best for our
country. This Manifesto is my pledge of a future
fair for all.

Coad Ba un,

Gordon Brown
Prime Minister

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010

Introduction

 

The argument of this Manifesto
is that to deliver a future fair
for all we need to rebuild our
economy, protect and reform
our public services as we
strengthen our society and
renew our politics. We, Labour,
are the people to carry out this
next stage of national renewal
because of our values and

our understanding of the role
of government: to stand by
ordinary people so they can
change their lives for the better.
It is our belief that it is active,
reforming government, not
absent government, that helps
make people powerful.

We are proud of our country
and the way it has changed
since 1997. It is just too easy to
forget. Our public services were
a byword for decline; today they
have been transformed. Our
large cities were reeling from two
savage recessions; today, despite
the global economic crisis, they
have a renewed prosperity and
civic pride. People were paid

£1 an hour; today the minimum
wage and tax credits provide

the dignity of a living income.
The welfare state simply did

not understand working women
and families. Today, with family-
friendly working and better
childcare it has at last begun to
do so.

These changes happened
because we applied our values

to the world as it was then.

We changed our party so that

it connected to the hopes and
aspirations of the British people.
We changed our country because
we rejected the philosophy

of the 1980s which said that
government should just get out
of the way and that we were in it
just for ourselves.

We are proud of our record

but today we are running for
the future. We have to address

a world that is very different
now, with major new challenges
we must confront: fighting for
our economic future in a tough
competitive world, tackling
climate change, improving
public services amidst financial
constraint, confronting the
reality of international terrorism,
adjusting to an ageing society

so people can live longer and
happier lives, and restoring trust
in politics.

The global financial crisis
shows we need to be bolder
about reforming our financial
markets and building our
economic future on fairer, more
solid foundations. To build on
success in our public services,
we need to protect investment
in the front line and also be bold
about putting citizens genuinely
in control. And we must be
bold reformers of our politics:
seizing this once in a generation
opportunity to make our

0:3

Parliament properly accountable.

In all these decisions, we offer
progressive solutions in tough
times. We do not measure the
boldness of our programme by
how much we spend but the
results we achieve. By taking
hard decisions, being guided at
all times by a sense of fairness,
we believe that we can continue
to advance towards the good
society in which we believe.

There is a big choice at this
election about whether we
confront these challenges and
build the kind of economy,
society and politics we believe
in, or duck them. But to be able
to meet these future challenges,
there are some immediate
decisions we need to get right
now. Above all, we need to
secure the economic recovery.
Get it right and we can go on to
build a strong economic future.
Get it wrong and we will slip
back into recession.

Labour believes we must
not put the recovery at risk
by reckless cuts to public
spending this year.

From the autumn of 2008,

big calls had to be made. We
nationalised Northern Rock,
protected people’s savings, cut
VAT to stimulate our economy,
put in place job guarantees to
get people back to work, and
stepped in to stop repossessions.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010

 

It is working, The banking
system has been stabilised.

Our economy is showing

signs of returning to growth.
Unemployment has, so far, risen
by over 500,000 less than people
expected this time last year.
Repossessions are at around half
the level of the 1990s.

The question at this election is
whether people think the choice
we made was the right one

and whether we use the power
of government to help sustain
recovery, or allow it to be snuffed
out. Every government of the
major developed economies — of
Left and Right — recognises the
need to support the economy
while growth is still fragile. We
will not cut spending this year,
but instead support the economy
to ensure recovery is established.

Labour believes we should
rebuild our economy in new
ways: with more high-tech
business, fairer rewards
and responsibility from all,
including at the top.

The world changed out of all
recognition in 2007 with the
onset of the global economic
crisis. Major British banks, the
custodians of our savings and
livelihoods, ran out of money
because of the recklessness of
those in charge. This Manifesto
makes the case that there should
be no return to business as usual.
People have suffered too much
with their jobs, livelihoods and

confidence to allow a return to
the same old ways. There is a
desire not simply to correct for
what went wrong, but to seize the
opportunity to build anew.

Financial services have been an
essential job creator in Britain
and will continue to be so. But
our financial institutions left to
themselves have undermined
our economy. We are enacting
sweeping banking reform to
prevent a repeat of the past;
ensuring new support for the
high-tech industries of the
future, such as green industries;
and taking action to forge a
new culture of long-termism in
business.

It isn’t markets or governments
that create wealth — people do,
through their own effort and
hard work. So we will do more

to support enterprise and to help
those who want to build up a
business and get on in life. Those
who can work must do so and it
needs to be properly valued. We
will end for good the concept of
a life on benefit by offering all
those unemployed for more than
two years work they must accept,
and we will make work pay better
with the goal of a minimum wage
rising at least in line with average
earnings and a guarantee that
people will be better off in work
than on benefit.

As we more than halve the fiscal
deficit over the next four years,
we will ensure that we do so ina

0:4

fair way with a combination of a
return to economic growth, cuts
to lower priority programmes
and fair tax rises. Responsibility
at the top means people paying
their fair share and we believe

it is right that those with the
broadest shoulders bear the
greatest burden of paying down
the deficit.

Labour believes we should
protect frontline spending
on childcare, schools, the
NHS and policing, and
reform our public services
to put people in control.

Millions of people working in
our public services embody the
best values of Britain, helping
empower people to make the
most of their own lives while
protecting them from the risks
they should not have to bear
on their own. Just as we need
to be bolder about the role of
government in making markets
work fairly, we also need to be
bold reformers of government.

For a decade we have combined
investment and reform and
improved our public services.
Now we need to rise to the
challenge of achieving even
higher standards in a period of
constrained resources. We will
drive forward our programme

to strip out all waste, improve
efficiency and get the most out of
every pound spent. We recognise
that investing more in priority
areas will mean cutting back in

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010

 

others. Above all we will build
public services that are more
personal to people’s needs: with
clear guarantees about standards,
the best providers taking over
others where they don’t make
the grade, and with new ways

of organising services such as
mutuals.

In health, this means if we don’t
meet our guarantees, for example
on waiting lists, the NHS will fund
you to go private. In education it
means that if the local school is
underperforming it will be taken
over; and parents who believe
their school is not good enough
can trigger a ballot to change the
leadership. And in policing, where
communities are being let down
by forces we will enable them to
be taken over by others.

Labour will strengthen
our society, by protecting
the things people value
and demanding rights and
responsibilities from all.

Our society is not broken; it is
strong in many different ways. But
it is changing fast. Changing with
immigration, changing as people
move more frequently, as young
people grow up more quickly and
older people live longer.

We will protect the things

people value: families, strong
communities, local institutions.
We will create a new settlement in
our country on how we care for
the elderly through the creation
of a National Care Service, and

fathers will have more time off
to spend with their kids. There
will be greater protection for the
local institutions people value,
like local post offices and pubs.
In everything we do, we will
demand the responsibilities that
must come with rights: to work
when you can, not to abuse your
neighbour or neighbourhood,

to show respect for Britain as a
newcomer, to pay your fair share
of tax.

Labour proposes radical

reform of our democracy to
reconnect politics to the people
it should serve. Just as the global
economic crisis was a shock

to our economic system; the
expenses crisis created turmoil in
our political system. It revealed
not just unacceptable behaviour
by some MPs but also that our
closed political system had lost
touch with people. Once again,
the response cannot be to try and
return to business as usual.

We need fundamental reform
of our politics to make it more
accountable. We will let the
people decide how to reform
our institutions and our politics:
changing the voting system and
electing a second chamber to
replace the House of Lords. But
we will go further, introducing
fixed-term parliaments, banning
MPs from paid second jobs

that pose a conflict of interest,
and providing for a free vote

in Parliament to widen the
franchise to 16 and 17 year olds.

0:5

In 1997 New Labour met the
call of national renewal. In

our politics and economy over
the last 18 months, we have
witnessed seismic events. In this
election, the first of the post-crisis
era, we stand as the people with
the experience, values and ideas
to help our country through the
next phase of national renewal.

This task has always relied

on optimism. Our principle
opponents, the Conservatives,
offer a fundamentally pessimistic
vision of national decline: about
Britain today and in the future.
Their only real prescription for
the good society is a smaller

state and the decisions they seek
to make for our country would
favour the privileged few over
the many. They would isolate
Britain, cutting us adrift from the
alliances and influence that will
enable us to succeed as a country.

This is a Manifesto that

is idealistic about what is
possible but realistic about

how to achieve it. This is not

a conservative moment. It is a
progressive moment. We speak
for the ordinary people of this
country who work hard, want
their kids to do better than
them, and worry about the
economic, environmental and
social challenges we face. We
are on their side, it is their voice,
needs and hopes that shape this
programme.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010

Securing Britain's future

 

The plans set out in this Manifesto take full account of the fiscal position we face. We will protect
frontline public services while meeting our commitment to halve the deficit over the next four years.

We are now emerging from the global financial crisis. It has had a lasting effect on tax receipts, here
in the UK and across the world. We are sticking to our spending plans this year so that support for
families and businesses remains as we secure the recovery. But from 2011-12, as growth takes hold,
spending will be tighter.

The Manifesto reflects the tough choices that we will make to secure Britain’s future in a way that is
fair to all:

¢ Tough choices for £15 billion efficiency savings in 2010-11.

¢ Tough choices on cutting government overheads: £11 billion of further operational
efficiencies and other cross-cutting savings to streamline government will be delivered
by 2012-13.

Tough choices on pay: action to control public-sector pay including a one per cent

cap on basic pay uplifts for 2011-12 and 2012-13, saving £3.4 billion a year, and new
restrictions on senior pay-setting. Tough decisions on public sector pensions to cap the
taxpayers’ liability — saving £1 billion a year.

Tough choices on spending: £5 billion already identified in cuts to lower priority
spending.

Tough choices on welfare: our reforms will increase fairness and work incentives,
including £1.5 billion of savings being delivered.

Tough choices on assets: £20 billion of asset sales by 2020.

Tough choices on tax: a bonus tax, reduced tax relief on pensions for the best off,
a new 50p tax rate on earnings over £150,000 and one penny on National Insurance
Contributions.

The challenge for Britain

To secure the recovery and learn the right lessons

from the global economic crisis, laying the foundations
for sustained growth: reforming banks, modernising
infrastructure, and as we pay down the deficit,
providing the right support to the private sector to
build a diverse, high-tech industrial economy. The Tories
would threaten recovery with cuts this year, and fail to
invest in our economic future.

The next stage of national renewal

¢ Secure the recovery by supporting the economy
now, and more than halve the deficit by 2014 through
economic growth, fair taxes and cuts to lower priority
spending.

Realise our stakes in publicly controlled banks to secure
the best deal for the taxpayer, introduce a new global
levy, and reform the rules for banking to ensure no
repeat of past irresponsibility.

Create UK Finance for Growth, bringing £4 billion
together to provide capital for growing businesses,
investing in the growth sectors of the future.

Build a high-tech economy, supporting business and
industry to create one million more skilled jobs and
modernising our infrastructure with High Speed Rail, a
Green Investment Bank and broadband access for all.

Encourage a culture of long-term commitment to
sustainable company growth, requiring a super-majority
of two-thirds of shareholders in corporate takeovers.

creating infrastructure and
enterprise, accompanied by the
diversification of our industrial
base, Britain will not emerge
from the recession ready for a
stronger, fairer future.

As the economy steadily
recovers, there will be no return
to business as usual: financial
institutions cannot continue the
practices of the past. Radical
change is needed. Without
long-term investment in wealth-

1:3

The engine of growth is private
enterprise: we will give business
our full support in creating
wealth and jobs. Strong and
sustained growth is fundamental
to a credible strategy for
keeping the public finances on a
stable long-term footing.

To be successful, business
needs stability, but to achieve
stability after the seismic shock
of the global banking crisis, the
governance of our economic
and financial institutions must
be radically reformed.

And to support business

in securing prosperity for
future generations, an activist
industrial strategy is needed:
learning the lessons from those
nations that have succeeded
in developing advanced
manufacturing and leading-
edge service industries. In
these countries the role of
government is not to stand
aside, but to nurture private-
sector dynamism, properly
supporting infrastructure and
the sectors of the future.

Securing the recovery

We have taken the tough
decisions to get Britain through
the downturn. We have done
so with fairness in mind: we
have not allowed the recession
created by the financial crisis
to become a depression, or

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Growth

 

stood aside and allowed grave
damage to be inflicted on our
society as it was in the 1930s
and 1980s. The Tories argue
that public spending should

be cut immediately, but this
position is out of step with every
other G20 government, right
or left. If governments do not
provide support when families
and businesses most need help,
growth is set back, jobs are
lost, and the country builds up
more debts — paying a higher
price in the future. To cut now
would push the economy back
into recession, not reducing the
deficit but increasing it.

We will continue to support
the economy while growth is
still fragile, sticking with our
targeted increase in public
spending over the next year to
sustain the recovery. Our focus
for the stimulus is strategic
investment, putting in place
the new digital, transport and
energy infrastructures that
will support the return to
sustainable growth.

Deficit reduction and fiscal
sustainability

Once the recovery is secure,
we will rapidly reduce the
budget deficit. We have set out
a clear, balanced and fair plan
to more than halve the deficit
over the next four years and we
will stick to it. We will achieve

this through a combination of:
fair tax increases; a firm grip
on public spending including
cuts in lower-priority areas;
and strategies for growth that
increase tax revenues and
reduce spending on benefits.
Over the next Parliament the
structural deficit will be cut by
more than two-thirds.

The huge global recession and
our efforts to counter it have
required us to make tough
choices, including on tax. We
have made our choice in ways
that put the greatest burden
on those with the broadest
shoulders. Bankers have

faced a bonus tax, tax relief
on pensions for the best off
will be reduced, and we have
introduced a new 50p tax rate
on earnings over £150,000. As
part of our plan to ensure we
protect frontline services while
halving the deficit over four
years, we have announced that
National Insurance will rise by
one penny. This will not happen
until next year, once growth

is firmly established. This is
the fairest way to protect key
frontline services. Our National
Insurance changes will mean
that no-one earning under
£20,000, or any pensioners,
will pay more. It is fairer than
alternative options like VAT —
which we have not increased
since 1997. Our commitments
allow us credibly to deliver our

1:4

deficit reduction plan and to
sustain the services that matter
most to families.

We will not raise the basic,
higher and new top rates of
tax in the next Parliament and
we renew our pledge not to
extend VAT to food, children’s
clothes, books, newspapers
and public transport fares. We
will maintain tax credits, not
cut them. And we have made
our choice to protect frontline
investment in childcare and
schools, the NHS and policing.

Tough choices

On public spending, we will be
relentless in making sure that
the public gets value for money
for every pound spent. We

will overhaul how government
works: cutting back-office

and property running costs;
abolishing unnecessary arms-
length-bodies; sharply reducing
spending on consultancy

and marketing; and cutting
lower-priority spend. We have
already shown in Budget 2010
how these steps will help us to
achieve savings of £20 billion
a year by 2012-13, on top of
the £15 billion savings that are
being delivered this year.

Je will take a tough stance
on public-sector pay, saving
over £3 billion by capping
public-sector pay rises at

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Growth

 

one per cent in 2011-12 and
2012-13. We have agreed
tough reforms to public-sector
pensions, which will make
significant savings and ensure
that pensions for the public-
sector workforce are secure and
sustainable in the long term.
Any government-controlled
appointment involving a salary
over £150,000 will require
ministerial sign-off. Savings
from our tougher approach will
help realise a fair rate of pay
for all those working for central
government.

As we prepare for the upturn,
fiscal responsibility and
monetary stability will be the
foundations on which we build.
We have made the new fiscal
responsibility framework legally
binding, and we will maintain
our inflation target of two per
cent so that mortgage rates can
be kept as low as possible.

Rebuilding our banking
system

The international banking
system played a key role in
fuelling the most severe global
recession since the Second
World War. We are determined
to support our financial

sector and for it to be a major
employer and wealth creator,
but there will be no return to
the excesses of the past — banks
will face tighter regulation. ‘The

banking system must support
domestic businesses, including
start-ups and entrepreneurs,

as well as mortgages. We have
agreed lending targets with those
banks in which we have a stake,
and there will be consequences
for executive remuneration if
targets are not met.

Learning the lessons of the
crisis means ensuring that far
greater responsibility is taken
for risk in the boardroom. We
will compel banks to keep more
capital and create ‘living wills’
so that should they fail there
will be no danger of that failure
spreading. Because the banking
crisis demonstrated the global
nature of financial instability,
we will continue to work with
our international partners to
require all banks to hold more
and better-quality capital,

to ensure counter-cyclical
protection, and to introduce a
global levy on financial services
so that banks across the world
contribute fairly to the society in
which they are based.

 

 

In the UK the new Council for
Financial Stability will monitor
and help address asset bubbles
and financial imbalances. We
will give the FSA additional
powers if necessary to
constrain and quash executive
remuneration where it is a
source of risk and instability.

1:5

If there is evidence of bonus
rules being evaded, we will act.

We will ensure greater
competition in the banking
sector, breaking up those banks
in which the Government
currently has a controlling stake.
The proposed Office of Fair
Trading review into how City
markets operate is welcome.
We value the role of building
societies owned by their
customers and the strength and
diversity that a healthy mutual
sector brings to our financial
services, and we will consult on
measures to help strengthen
the sector. As one option for
the disposal of Northern Rock,
we will encourage a mutual
solution, while ensuring that the
sale generates maximum value
for money for the taxpayer.

Rebuilding our industrial
base: new industries, new
jobs, new knowledge

Britain is the sixth largest
manufacturing economy in the
world. Because of substantial
investment since 1997, the UK
has an excellent research base
and is already strong in some
world-leading sectors. But if we
make the right decisions as a
country in the coming years —
through a new industrial policy,
stronger infrastructure and a
renewed partnership between
business and government — we

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Growth

 

can be leaders in the emerging
industries of the future.

After the financial crisis, we will
ensure that growing companies
can access the investment they
need to expand. Finance must
e at the service of industry,

as new public channels are

uilt to deliver private funds

0 innovative and fast-growing
companies. The new UK
Finance for Growth Fund will
ring together a total of £4
illion of public funds and
combine it with private money
o channel equity to businesses
ooking to develop and grow.
Within this, the Growth Capital
Fund will focus on SMEs
which need capital injections of
etween £2 and £10 million,
while the Innovation Investment
Fund will focus on the needs of
high-tech firms.

 

Business investment in physical
capital will play a key role in

a balanced and sustainable
recovery. The Strategic
Investment Fund is supporting
important new investment in
the nuclear and renewables
industries. We will provide
incentives for companies to
invest through R&D tax credits,
and protect and increase the
size of capital allowances that
help to grow key sectors such as
manufacturing. We will ensure a
competitive regime through the
development of the patent-box

—a lower rate of corporation
tax to encourage UK-based
innovation — supporting the
UK’s strengths in new industries
and sectors.

Investing in science and
research

Britain is among the best places
in the world to do science,
having massively increased
investment in research and
development as a proportion
of national income. We are
committed to a ring-fenced
science budget in the next
spending review. To help us

do better in turning research
outputs into innovation,

we will provide focused
investment for Technology and
Innovation Centres, developing
technologies where the UK has
world-leading expertise.

We will also support university
research through the Higher
Education Innovation Fund,
and through the development
of a new University Enterprise
Capital Fund. The proceeds of
success will flow back into the
higher education sector.

As we create a more diverse
economy, we will strengthen
support for exporters to help
us increase our market share
with our traditional markets in
Europe and the United States,
while breaking further into the

1:6

emerging markets of China,
India and Brazil.

We must seize the opportunity
to develop education, in
particular higher education,

as a great export business.
Universities will be encouraged
to develop international links
and research partnerships, and
we want the Open University
and learndirect to reach the
global market in distance
learning. We will develop a
new gateway for the export of
NHS intellectual property and
cutting-edge services.

Restoring full employment

We expect our growing
economic and sectoral
strengths to create at least one
million skilled jobs by 2015.
These jobs of the future will
increasingly come from the
new growth sectors in which
we are investing — low-carbon,
digital and creative industries,
life sciences — and professional
services in business, healthcare
and education.

There will be greater prosperity
for every region of the UK
economy. A regional growth
fund will be established by

the Regional Development
Agencies with regional ministers
given an enhanced role, and we
will help our core cities and city
regions to become powerhouses

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Growth

 

of innovation and growth, with
a major devolution of power to
shape local transport and skills.

Championing an enterprise
economy

At the heart of our approach
to building a strong and fair
Britain is a commitment to
support enterprise. We will
back those who want to get

on, work their way up, and
generate wealth. We will keep
business taxation competitive
at the same time as we increase
capital allowances to encourage
investment.

There is no substitute for

the drive and ambition that
entrepreneurs bring. We will
support small businesses and
help with their cash flow by
continuing our Time to Pay
scheme that has already —
through tax and NICs deferral
~ helped thousands of firms;
offering a one-year holiday

on business rates for small
businesses; widening support for
training and apprenticeships;
and in recognising the special
contribution of entrepreneurs
we are doubling the
Entrepreneurs Relief lifetime
limit to £2 million.

We will also create a new Small
Business Credit Adjudicator
with statutory powers ensuring
that SMEs are not turned down
unfairly when applying to banks
for finance.

We will help to create a new
generation of entrepreneurs,
ensuring that those studying
for vocational skills are offered
the opportunity to learn how to
start and run a business, while
the Flying Start programme
will do the same for final-year
university students.

We will continue to simplify
regulation and avoid
unnecessary red tape. If it is
used correctly, regulation can
help drive innovation, as well as
protect workers and consumers.
We will seek to reduce the costs
of regulation by more than

£6 billion by 2015.

21st Century
infrastructure

The key to creating the
industries of the future

is renewing the national
infrastructure on which
firms rely. To ensure Britain’s
infrastructure needs are
properly resourced, we will
work in partnership with

the private sector, reforming
the regulation of energy to
improve incentives for the
private sector to invest. We will

1:7

establish a Green Investment
Bank to invest in low-carbon
infrastructure, with the
Government’s stake funded by
the sale of infrastructure assets.
The Government will seek to
match its contribution with at
least £1 billion of private-sector
investment.

The newly formed
Infrastructure Planning
Commission will — within a
democratically determined
framework — help streamline
and speed up decision-making
on major projects. We now
propose to extend the public
interest test so that it is
applied to potential takeovers
of infrastructure and utility
companies.

Broadband Britain

Britain must be a world

leader in the development of
broadband. We are investing

in the most ambitious plan of
any industrialised country to
ensure a digital Britain for all,
extending access to every home
and business. We will reach the
long-term vision of superfast
broadband for all through a
public-private partnership

in three stages: first, giving
virtually every household in the
country a broadband service of
at least two megabits per second
by 2012; second, making
possible superfast broadband
for the vast majority of Britain

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Growth

 

in partnership with private
operators, with Government
investing over £1 billion in the
next seven years; and lastly
reaching the final ten per cent
using satellites and mobile

broadband.

Because we are determined
that every family and business,
not just some, should benefit,
we will raise revenue to pay
for this from a modest levy

on fixed telephone lines. And
we will continue to work with
business, the BBC and other
broadcasting providers to
increase take-up of broadband
and to ensure Britain becomes a
leading digital economy.

Rebuilding our transport
infrastructure

Britain needs to invest in
modern, high-capacity and low-
carbon transport infrastructure.
At the heart of our growth
plan is the commitment to

a new high-speed rail line,
linking North and South. Built
in stages, the initial line will
link London to Birmingham,
Manchester, the East Midlands,
Sheffield and Leeds, and then
to the North and Scotland.

By running through-trains

from day one, cities including
Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle
and Liverpool will also be part
of the initial network. Journey
times will be slashed — those

from the West Midlands to
London will be as little as

31 minutes. We will consult fully
on legislation to take forward
our high-speed rail plans within
the next Parliament.

High-speed rail is not just
about faster journey times.

It will free up capacity on
existing intercity rail lines,
enabling more rail freight,
commuter and local services
We will press ahead with a
major investment programme
in existing rail services, hugely
improving commuter services
into and through London,

and electrifying new rail-lines
including the Great Western
Main Line from London to
South Wales. We will complete
the new east-west Crossrail line
in London adding ten per cent
to London transport capacity.

Rail passenger numbers

have increased by 40 per

cent in the last ten years and
punctuality and quality of
service are improving steadily.
We will encourage more
people to switch to rail with
an enforceable right to the
cheapest fare, while trebling
the number of secure cycle-
storage spaces at rail stations.
We will welcome rail franchise
bids from not-for-profit, mutual
or co-operative franchise
enterprises and will look to
remove unfair barriers that

1:8

prevent such bids benefiting
passengers and taxpayers.

Tackling road congestion is a
key Labour priority. We will
extend hard-shoulder running
on motorways, alongside
targeted motorway widening
including on the M25. Too
much disruption is caused

by local road works: we will
increase tenfold the penalties
on utilities who allow work

to overrun. We rule out the
introduction of national road
pricing in the next Parliament.

Heathrow is Britain’s
international hub airport,
already operating at full
capacity, and supporting
millions of jobs, businesses and
citizens who depend upon it.
We support a third runway

at Heathrow, subject to strict
conditions on environmental
impact and flight numbers, but
we will not allow additional
runways to proceed at any other
airport in the next Parliament.

Through our investment,
Labour has put Britain at the
forefront of electric and low-
carbon vehicle manufacturing.
To promote the rapid take-up
of electric and low-carbon
cars, we will ensure there

are 100,000 electric vehicle
charging points by the end of
the next Parliament.

Corporate governance
reform

To build strong businesses

we need skilled managers,
accountable boards, and
committed shareholders

~all with a culture of long-
term commitment. We will
strengthen the 2006 Companies
Act where necessary better

to reflect these principles.
The UK’s Stewardship Code
for institutional shareholders
should be strengthened and
we will require institutional
shareholders to declare how
hey vote and for banks to put
heir remuneration policies

o shareholders for explicit
approval.

Too many takeovers turn out

o be neither good for the
acquiring company or the firm
eing bought. The system needs
reform. Companies should be
more transparent about their
ong-term plans for the business
hey want to acquire. There
needs to be more disclosure of
who owns shares, a requirement
for bidders to set out how

hey will finance their bids

and greater transparency on
advisers’ fees.

 

There should be a higher
threshold of support — two-
thirds of shareholders — for
securing a change of ownership
and the case for limiting votes
to those on the register before
the bid should be examined.

Creating a shareholding
society

We want Britain’s workers to
have a stake in their company
by widening share ownership
and creating more employee-
owned and trust-owned
businesses. We want to see

a step change in the role of
employee-owned companies in
the economy, recognising that
many entrepreneurs would
like to see their companies in
the hands of their employees
when they retire. We will review
any outstanding barriers to the
formation of more employee-
companies like the John Lewis
Partnership.

The challenge for Britain

To grow together as a country, rewarding those who
work hard so they can do well and look after their
families: returning Britain to full employment, enabling
people to get higher-paid and better jobs, and widening
access to home ownership. The Tories have no plan for
fairness; their decisions would make our society more
unequal and unjust.

The next stage of national renewal

¢ 200,000 jobs through the Future Jobs Fund, with a job or
training place for young people who are out of work for
six months, but benefits cut at ten months if they refuse
to take part; and anyone unemployed for more than two
years guaranteed work, but no option of life on benefits.

¢ A National Minimum Wage rising at least in line with
average earnings, and a new £40-a-week Better Off in
Work guarantee.

¢ More advanced apprenticeships and Skills Accounts for
workers to upgrade their skills.

¢ No stamp duty for first-time buyers on all house
purchases below £250,000 for two years, paid for by a
five per cent rate on homes worth more than £1 million.

¢ A People’s Bank at the Post Office; a Universal Service
Obligation on banks to serve every community; a
clampdown on interest rates for doorstep and payday
loans.

As the British economy returns
to growth, we will ensure that
everyone who is willing to
work shares fairly in renewed
prosperity. We will support the

unemployment and a life on

more chances to get on at work
and a fair distribution of growth
throughout Britain.

on benefit, so all those who can
work will be required to do so.
At the same time, we believe
that people should be able to
earn enough to live and be
better off than on welfare.

2:2

In today’s world, every worker
needs to be able to upgrade
their skills in order to get on. As
well as good career prospects,
people want to know that their
living standards and quality

of life will improve. So we

will enable more people to get
on the housing ladder; offer

a helping hand to build up
savings; and secure a fair deal
with the banks to strengthen
people’s personal finances.

A modern welfare state
for all

We will build a personalised
welfare system that offers
protection for all those who
need it, increases people’s
control over their own lives, and
is clear about the responsibilities
owed to others. Getting more
people into employment
increases tax revenues and
reduces spending on benefits.
Our intensive help for people
out of work — starting from

day one — has already kept
unemployment more than half
a million lower than predicted
during the recession, saving
£15 billion over the next five
years.

We are determined that no-one
should be scarred for life by
joblessness. No young person
in Britain should be long-term
unemployed: those out of work
for six months or more will

be guaranteed employment

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010

or training through the £1
billion Future Jobs Fund, with
mandatory participation after
ten months. The fund will
support 200,000 jobs. All those
who are long-term unemployed
for two years will be guaranteed
a job placement, which they will
be required to take up or have
their benefits cut.

More people with disabilities
and health conditions will

be helped to move into work
from Incapacity Benefit

and Employment Support
Allowance, as we extend the
use of our tough-but-fair work
capability test. This will help to
reduce the benefit bill by £1.5
billion over the next four years.
We will reassess the Incapacity
Benefit claims of 1.5 million
people by 2014, as we move
those able to work back

into jobs.

For those with the most serious
conditions or disabilities who
want to work there will be a
new guarantee of supported
employment after two years on
benefit. We will seek to ensure
that disabled people are able to
lead dignified and independent
lives, free of discrimination and
with the support to which they
are entitled.

The lone parent employment
rate has increased by over 12
per cent since 1997. We are

radically reforming how Job
Centre Plus helps lone parents:
providing extra help with
childcare, training and support
to find family-friendly work,
while requiring those with
children aged three to take steps
to prepare for work and actively
to seek employment once

their youngest child is seven
years old.

Our goal is to make
responsibility the cornerstone
of our welfare state. Housing
Benefit will be reformed to
ensure that we do not subsidise
people to live in the private
sector on rents that other
ordinary working families could
not afford. And we will continue
to crack down on those who try
to cheat the benefit system.

Making work pay

The National Minimum
Wage is one of our proudest
achievements. It protects

and sustains millions of low-
paid workers. To ensure that
the lowest paid share fairly

in rising prosperity, the Low
Pay Commission’s remit will
have the goal of the National
Minimum Wage rising at least
in line with average earnings
over the period to 2015.

To underline our commitment

to helping the lowest paid
we will ask all Whitehall

2:3

Departments, within their
allocated budgets, to follow
the lead of those who already
pay the Living Wage. This will
be supported by measures to
address high pay in the public
sector - reducing pay-bill
pressure in the years ahead.

To ensure that work pays,
we will guarantee that when
someone who has found it
difficult to get into work comes
off benefits, their family will
be at least £40 a week better
off. This is our Better Off in
Jork guarantee: together the
National Minimum Wage and
tax credits should always make
work pay. And we will consult
on further reforms to simplify
the benefits system and make
sure it gives people the right
incentives and personal support
to get into work and progress in
their jobs.

We want everyone to have
better prospects in work.

We will give the Low Pay
Commission additional
responsibilities to report

on productivity and career
progression in low-skilled, low-
paid sectors, bringing together
representatives from the
business community and social
partners.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Living standards

 

Getting ahead: investing
in you

As we restore full employment
to the British economy, we
will seek to make work more
fulfilling and secure. That
means helping people to
improve their skills.

We have rescued the
apprenticeship system
supporting more than 250,000
places a year, and we will

now expand technician-level
apprenticeships to ensure
Britain has the skills it needs for
the future.

We have legislated for a right

to request time for training

and will continue to invest in
workplace training through
Train to Gain. New Skills
Accounts will enable every
worker to make choices that
drive improvement and quality
in the skills system. Accounts
will help learners know what
training they are entitled to, the
level of funding available and
the benefits of training for their
careers. But good work is about
more than just skills. Songer
employee engagement improves
innovation and productivity: we
will continue to promote more
effective employee engagement
in the workplace.

Improving your living
standards

Our aim is to put more wealth
in the hands of the British
people. We have done all we
can to keep mortgage rates

low — at 0.5 per cent during
this recession compared to 15
per cent in the 1990s — and

will continue to do so in the
future. The direct tax and
benefit measures introduced
since 1997 mean that in 2010-
11, households will be £1,450
a year better off on average. A
family with one child and one
person working full time will
have a minimum income of
£310 a week in October 2010 -
27 per cent higher in real terms
than in 1999. Tax credits will be
increased not cut.

As family budgets are under
greater pressure, we will do
more to help people with the
cost of living. Council Tax
increases have fallen to their
lowest ever rate and we expect
them to stay low. There will
be more help with energy bills
through the Social Tariff and
Winter Fuel Payments, and we
will work with the regulator to
promote greater competition
and diversity in the supply

of energy to ensure falling
wholesale prices get passed onto
households in lower bills.

2:4

Fairness at work

We will strive to ensure fairness
at work for all employees,
continuing our crackdown

on exploitative gang-masters
and rogue employers. In all
sectors the law must be upheld,
properly enforcing safety and
employment rights, and tackling
tax avoidance. We will extend
the licensing approach to labour
providers in the construction
industry if the evidence

shows that is the best way to
enforce employment rights. We
have strengthened HMRC’s
enforcement of the minimum
wage. In future it will co-
operate more closely with local
authorities to enforce minimum
wage legislation. We are
enacting the Agency Workers
Directive to offer additional
protection to agency workers in
relation to pay and conditions.

New legislation and the
Equality and Human Rights
Commission will ensure that
people are not held back at
work because of their gender,
age, disability, race and
religious or sexual orientation.
The new Equality Act will be
enforced, promoting fairness
across our society. The public
duty to promote equality of
opportunity is being extended.
/e will encourage employers to
make greater use of pay reviews
and equality checks to eliminate

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Living standards

 

unfair pay gaps, including
inequalities in pay between men
and women.

Modern trade unions are an
important part of our society
and economy, providing
protection and advice for
employees, and working

for equality and greater
fairness in the workplace. We
welcome their positive role in
encouraging partnership and
productivity.

More home ownership

Owning your own home is the
aspiration of most families. We
want as many people as possible
to share in the benefits of home
ownership, and to have a stake
in an affordable home. That
everyone has access to a decent
home at a price they can afford
is a central Labour ambition.

We will widen home ownership:
over 160,000 households have
been supported into ownership
through government action
since 1997. We will exempt
purchases below £250,000
from stamp duty for the next
two years, benefiting more
than nine out of ten first-time
buyers. This will be paid for by
increasing stamp duty to five
per cent for homes worth more
than £1 million.

Our highly popular Home Buy
Direct scheme will continue.
We will work with Housing
Associations to develop a new
form of affordable housing
targeted at working families on
modest incomes who struggle
in the private sector and rarely
qualify for social housing. This
will focus on enabling working
people to rent an affordable
home at below market rates
while they build up an

equity stake.

We have acted decisively to
make repossession the last
resort, helping over 330,000
families stay in their homes so
that repossessions are running
at around half the rate of the
early 1990s recession. We will
now strengthen regulation to
ensure consistent standards
of consumer protection from
repossession, making the FSA
responsible for the regulation
of all mortgages. This means
transferring second charge
loans such as debt consolidation
loans, which are often issued
by sub-prime lenders, into

the FSA’s tougher regime —
guaranteeing equal protection
for homeowners.

We are investing £7.5 billion
over two years to 2011 to build
new houses, delivering 110,000
additional energy-efficient,
affordable homes to rent or

2:5

buy. We believe local authorities
should be able to play their
part in providing social

housing in the future; and we
will reform the council house
financing system to enable
local authorities to maintain
properties at the Decent Home
standard and to build up to
10,000 council houses a year by
the end of the next Parliament.
Tenant involvement in the
management of social housing
properties will be strongly
encouraged.

Better housing

This Government has led the
way in making sure that British
homes are greener homes
through our world-leading
commitment to all new homes
being zero carbon by 2016
and the construction of new
eco-towns, which will have

the highest standards of green
living yet seen in Britain.

Local authorities now have
greater flexibility over the
allocation of social housing in
order to promote mixed and
sustainable communities. We
will guarantee the three million
households who rent from a
private landlord the right to

a written tenancy agreement
and access to free and impartial
advice; and we will establish

a new National Landlord
Register.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Living standards

 

We are committed to ending
rough sleeping by 2012, and
we will tackle the problems
faced by homeless people with
multiple needs. We will provide
homeless 16 and 17 year olds
with Foyer-based supported
accommodation and training
including help with parenting
skills. Once there is enough
provision to provide universal
coverage we will legislate to
change the law so that for 16
and 17 year olds the right to
housing is met solely through
supported housing.

Our regeneration policies
have transformed previously
neglected communities, and
our great cities are among
the best in the world. We will
make savings in regeneration
funding and focus on tackling
worklessness, transforming the
prospects of those areas most
disconnected from the wider
economy.

Support with saving

We will do more to support
saving and spread wealth across
more families. The annual
limits for Individual Savings
Accounts have been raised to
£10,200 and will be index-
linked. The Pension Credit
capital disregard will increase
from £6,000 to £10,000.

The pioneering Savings

Gateway account for people on
lower incomes will be available
to over eight million families
from July 2010, providing a
match of 50p for each £1 saved
up to a limit of £300. We will
extend this approach even
further, giving a boost to savings
for more people on middle
incomes. ‘To help encourage

the savings habit among

young adults, we will develop a
matched savings account for all
18-30 basic-rate taxpayers, as
set out in the Budget.

For the next generation we will
protect — not cut — the Child
Trust Fund — the world’s first
universal savings policy for
young people, already giving
4.8 million children a nest

egg for the future. We will
contribute an additional £100
a year to the Child Trust Funds
of all disabled children.

A new deal on personal
finances

In the post-crisis economy, we
will fight for consumers and
stand up to vested interests that
treat people unfairly, whether in
the private or public sector. We
want a fair deal for all.

The Post Office has an
invaluable role to play in

our communities and in
serving local businesses. To
promote trusted and accessible

2:6

banking, we will transform

the Post Office into a People’s
Bank offering a full range of
competitive, affordable products.
This will help sustain the
network and boost competition
in banking. The universal postal
service delivered by the Royal
Mail connects and binds us
together as a country. We are
firmly committed to the 28
million homes and businesses
across the country receiving
mail six days a week, with the
promise that one price goes
everywhere. The Royal Mail
and its staff are taking welcome
and needed steps to modernise
work practices. For the future,
continuing modernisation and
investment will be needed by the
Royal Mail in the public sector.

Ye will introduce a universal
service obligation on retail
banks, so that all consumers
with a valid address have a
legal right to a basic bank
account, and a right to redress
if this is refused. Banks will
have to publicly report on
the extent to which they are
under-serving communities.
And we will introduce a new
levy on the banks to help fund
a step-change in the scale of
affordable lending by third-
sector organisations, including
a new partnership with the Post
Office, offering an alternative
to loan sharks and high-cost
doorstep lending.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Living standards

 

Over the lifetime of the next
Parliament, as more affordable
lending becomes available, we
will clamp down on the interest
rates and other fees charged
by instant loan companies and
payday or doorstep lenders,
tackling the very high cost
lending that hits low-income
communities hardest. We will
introduce a single regulator
for consumer finance to
restore confidence and trust
with responsibility for the
supervision of all unsecured
lending being passed to the
Financial Services Authority.
And new rules governing how
financial products are sold will
be introduced with a crackdown
on unfair terms in contracts.

Finally, we will seek to promote
competition in high-street
banking by introducing
portable bank account and cash
ISA numbers that stimulate
switching where consumers

are dissatisfied, along with
consistent, easily understood
labelling of financial products.

Education

 

The challenge for Britain

To raise standards, promote excellence and narrow
achievement gaps by giving the best school leaders
and federations more schools to run, and by giving
parents new rights and clear guarantees of high-quality
teaching and support for every pupil — underpinned by
increased spending. The Tories want to gamble with
our children’s education, putting school improvement
at risk and taking away the guarantees of an excellent
education for all.

The next stage of national renewal

¢ Spending increased on frontline Sure Start and free
childcare, schools and 16-19 learning.

An expansion of free nursery places for two year olds
and 15 hours a week of flexible, free nursery education
for three and four year olds.

Every pupil leaving primary school secure in the basics,
with a 3Rs guarantee of one-to-one and small-group
tuition for every child falling behind; and in secondary
school, every pupil with a personal tutor and a choice of
good qualifications.

A choice of good schools in every area — and, where
parents are not satisfied — the power to bring in new
school leadership teams, through mergers and take-
overs, with up to 1,000 secondary schools part of an
accredited schools group by 2015.

Every young person guaranteed education or training
until 18, with 75 per cent going on to higher education,
or completing an advanced apprenticeship or technician
level training, by the age of 30.

Education is the key to personal
fulfilment, economic prosperity
and social mobility. Our goal

is educational excellence for
every child, whatever their

background or circumstances.
In 1997, half of our secondary

schools were below the basic
minimum standard. Now,

3:2

because of sustained investment
and reform, it is just one in
twelve, with standards rising
fastest in disadvantaged areas.
Nearly 100,000 more children
each year leave primary school
secure in reading, writing and
maths. School buildings, once
characterised by leaking roofs
and second-class facilities, are
being transformed. The quality
of teaching is the best ever and
teachers have the status and
respect they deserve.

Frontline spending on Sure
Start, childcare, schools and 16-
19 learning will be increased,
safeguarding our priorities

such as an additional 41,000
teachers and 120,000 teaching
assistants. But funding will not
rise as fast as in recent years,
making tough choices necessary
to focus resources on the front
line, with £950m saved through
collaboration and efficiency

in back office functions and
procurement and £500m from
quangos and central budgets.

The range and reach of
innovative school providers will
increase, spreading excellence
to all schools. We will strive to
get the best people into teaching
and give parents new rights

to secure good schooling for
their children. Participation

in post-school learning will
expand, with more and better
apprenticeships, improved

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Education

 

vocational education, and wider
access to higher education.

The early years

Good play-based early learning
gets children off to a flying start,
so that they begin school ready
to learn and achieve. We have
expanded high-quality early
learning and childcare, which
also supports parents to work
when they have young children
and improves family living
standards.

There are now over 3,500

Sure Start Children’s Centres
and every three and four year
old has access to free nursery
education, which is rising to

15 hours a week. Children’s
Centres will become the
bedrock of a new national
under-fives service: ‘one-stop
shops’, open to all families,
offering excellent affordable
childcare, healthcare and
parenting advice. The number
of free early learning places for
disadvantaged two year olds will
be expanded, on the way to our
long-term goal of universal free
childcare for this age group.

Flexible childcare

Busy working parents will
have more flexibility over
the hours their children have
access to nursery education,
such as taking them over two
full working days, as well as

greater choice over when
children start school. We will
also explore allowing parents to
carry over their free hours of
nursery education from year to
year. Childcare vouchers will
be retained, with all families
receiving income tax relief at
the basic rate, and childcare
standards will be raised by a
more qualified workforce.

We want to strengthen parental
engagement with Sure Start
Children’s Centres. Some
voluntary and third-sector
organisations already run
networks of Centres, and

we will now pioneer mutual
federations running groups of
local Children’s Centres in the
community interest.

Excellence for all: every
school a good school

Every parent wants their child
to attend an excellent school —
with the best possible teaching
and facilities. So for pupils and
parents we will set out in law
guarantees of the excellent
education and personal support
they can expect.

No school can be better than
the quality of its teachers. We
have the best generation of
teachers ever, supported by
teaching assistants and the
wider workforce. But we must
continue to get the very best

3:3

people into teaching, from the
most committed graduates

to the highest calibre career
switchers. Teach First will be
extended to attract more of the
best graduates into teaching,
including teaching in primary
schools.

We have invested heavily in the
professionalism and expertise
of the workforce, and will build
on this success with a new right
for every teacher to continuous
professional development;

in return they will have to
demonstrate high standards

of teaching to maintain their
licence to practise. We will
promote new ‘Teacher Training
Academies and £10,000
‘golden handcuffs’ to attract
the best teachers into the most
challenging schools.

While the number of low-
performing schools has
decreased dramatically, we
cannot tolerate any coasting

or persistently poor schools.
Over the last decade, we have
developed a cadre of world-class
head teachers, radically opened
up our school system to new
providers, and worked with local
authorities and school governing
bodies to drive up standards.

Our task now is to devolve
more power and responsibility
to strong school leaders and
to spread excellence, with

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Education

 

up to 1,000 schools, through
mergers and take-overs, part
of an accredited school group
by 2015 — a new generation of
not-for-profit chains of schools
with a proven track record.
These will include excellent
school leaders from the
maintained sector, universities,
colleges, faith schools, academy

chains and independent schools.

We now have 200 academies
and over 50 National Challenge
Trusts, with another 200
academies in the pipeline. And
we are pioneering new co-
operative trust schools where
parents, teachers and the local
community come together to
help govern their local school.

More power for parents

Where parents are dissatisfied
with the choice of secondary
schools in an area, local
authorities will be required

to act, securing take-overs of
poor schools, the expansion of
good schools, or in some cases,
entirely new provision. Where
parents at an individual school
want change, they will be able
to trigger a ballot on whether
to bring in a new leadership
team from a proven and trusted
accredited provider.

School Report Cards will give

every parent clear information
on standards, levels of parental
satisfaction and behaviour and

bullying. They will provide
information on the progress
being made by all pupils, not
just by some. We will consult on
giving every school an overall
grade for its performance.

We reject a return to the 1 1-
plus or a free-for-all admission
system. Our commitment to
fair admissions is essential

to liberating the potential of
every child. Ensuring all pupils
make progress also requires a
fair funding system, so we will
introduce a local pupil premium
to guarantee that extra funding
to take account of deprivation
follows the pupil. Barriers to
social mobility will be tackled
by giving disadvantaged families
free access to broadband to
support their child’s learning.
All parents will be guaranteed
online information about their
child’s progress and behaviour.

We have high expectations

for children with special
educational needs and schools
will be held to account for how
well they meet the needs of
these pupils. We are expanding
the number of specialist
dyslexia teachers and improving
teacher training for children
with autism. The statementing
process will be improved to give
more support to parents, and
the supply of teachers with the
specialist skills needed to teach
pupils with severe learning

3:4

disabilities in special schools will
be increased.

Primary schools: no child
left behind

More children than ever leave
primary school secure in the
basics. Every primary school
now offers whole-class teaching
of English using phonics, and
we are introducing specialist
teachers to achieve a similar
step-change in Maths. But
every parent rightly wants

far more, so our primary
curriculum reforms will create
more flexibility for teachers

to offer a broad, challenging
and engaging education, with
opportunities to play sport, and
to take part in arts, culture and
music, including the chance

to learn a musical instrument.
As part of these reforms, all
primary schools will teach a
modern foreign language. We
will create a specialist Mandarin
teacher training qualification,
so that many more primary
schools have access to a
qualified primary teacher able
to teach Mandarin.

Parents will be given a ‘3Rs
Guarantee’ that every pupil
who falls behind at primary
school and early in secondary
school will receive special one-
to-one or small-group catch-up
provision. This will include

up to 40,000 six and seven

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Education

 

year olds benefiting from extra
tuition in English and Maths
through ‘Every Child a Reader’
and ‘Every Child Counts’, and
300,000 receiving ten hours

of one-to-one tuition in both
English and Maths when they
are older.

For primary-age children, we
are guaranteeing childcare and
constructive activities from
8am until 6pm in term-time at
their own or a neighbouring
school; this entitlement will
particularly help busy working
parents juggle work and family
life. We are extending the
provision of free school meals
so that an additional half a
million primary school children
in families on low incomes

will benefit from healthy and
nutritious food, and we are
trialing free school meals for
all primary school children in
pilot areas across the country.
Together, these schemes will
thoroughly test the case for
universal free school meals,
with the results available by
autumn 2011.

Secondary schools:
excellence for all, personal
to each

Our secondary schools have
been transformed by great
school leaders, teachers and
support staff; We will build on
these achievements, tailoring

education to the aspirations and
aptitudes of individual pupils.
All secondary school pupils

will have a Personal Tutor of
Studies, and we will work with
schools to extend one-to-one

or small-group tuition to pupils
in the run-up to their GCSEs.
Such an education should no
longer be the preserve of the
wealthiest few, but a central part
of the curriculum.

More young people will be able
to study single science subjects
and modern foreign languages.
Diplomas will strengthen the
status and quality of vocational
study and bring together
academic and vocational
programmes. And the Gifted
and Talented programme will
be reformed and improved,
guaranteeing additional
personalised support. We will
review the qualifications system
in 2013, with any changes
taking place in the Parliament
after next. Meanwhile, the new
independent exam regulator
will ensure that standards are
being maintained.

Because the learning
environment itself matters,

we will take forward our
Building Schools for the Future
programme to rebuild or
refurbish secondary schools,
giving our children first-

rate facilities that support
inspirational teaching and

3:5

access to ICT, sports and the
arts.

Zero tolerance of poor
behaviour

The vast majority of schools
have good or outstanding
behaviour. But no child should
have their learning disturbed
by poor discipline in the
classroom. Teachers have
strong new powers to ensure
order and discipline and we
will support their use. Home
School Agreements will be
strengthened, making clear
the responsibilities of families
and pupils. Every parent will
agree to adhere to the school’s
behaviour rules, signing
contracts each year facing

real consequences if they fail
to live up to them, including
the option of a court-imposed
parenting order. Safer School
Partnerships will be extended to
every school where the head or
parents demand it.

Alternative education for
excluded pupils will be
transformed. New providers
will be encouraged to take over
existing Pupil Referral Units,
pioneering approaches that
bring order and discipline back
to young people’s lives. More
will be invested in anti-bullying
interventions including tackling
homophobic bullying.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Education

 

Cadet forces will move
increasingly into state schools
and we will expand spare time
activities for young people,
doubling those available —
including sport — on Friday

and Saturday nights, with
neighbourhood police teams
closely involved in areas

where youth crime is highest.
Teacher training institutions
will be asked to provide
specialist courses for teachers in
promoting pupils’ resilience and
responsibility.

All children safe
and thriving

Living in a family on a

low income, having special
educational needs or disabilities,
and being in care all remain
strongly linked to children
failing to achieve. We are
determined to narrow the gap
between these children and
their peers, and to continue

to invest in specialist services,
including short breaks for
disabled children. Learning
from the best systems around
the world, we will improve
foster and residential care. We
will expand specialised foster
care for the most vulnerable
children and the Care2Work
programme for all care leavers.

Through Children’s Trusts,
children and youth services
will work closely with schools

and colleges, increasingly
co-locating wider children’s
services with schools. Early
intervention programmes
with a proven impact will be
promoted. We will continue
to reduce teenage pregnancy
rates, with compulsory, high-
quality Sex and Relationship
Education.

Ensuring all children are safe
from abuse and harm will
remain a top priority. The new
Vetting and Barring system

will protect children without
being unduly burdensome or
interfering in private family
arrangements. Social work
training will be radically
overhauled, raising the status
and standards of the profession,
and we will establish a National
College of Social Work. We will
publish detailed Serious Case
Review summaries that explain
the facts, but keep full reports
out of the public domain in
order to protect children’s
identities.

Staying on to get ahead

Staying on rates at age 16 are
increasing, thanks in part to our
school leavers’ guarantee of

a place at sixth form, college,
training or an apprenticeship.

But to ensure a new wave

of social mobility, we are
committed to an historic

3:6

change: raising the education
and training leaving age to 18.
All young people will stay on

in learning until 18, Education
Maintenance Allowances

will be retained and there

will be an entitlement to an
apprenticeship place in 2013 for
all suitably qualified 16-18 year
olds.

Further education colleges

are the backbone of our post-
school education system and
they are leading the way with
new Diplomas, working with
schools. We will introduce
greater freedom for all colleges
to respond to local community
needs and free them up from
red tape. Students will be given
clearer information on the
quality of courses on offer, with
a ‘traffic-ight grading system
for all courses and colleges. To
complement vocational learning
for 14-19 year olds in schools
and colleges, we will pioneer
University Technical Colleges
and new Studio Schools that
offer innovative curricula
involving practical learning and
paid work.

Advanced apprenticeships will
be radically expanded, creating
up to 70,000 places a year.
These provide well-respected
routes into high-skilled careers
and further study at university
and will support our ambition
that three-quarters of young

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Education

 

people enter higher education
or complete an advanced
apprenticeship or equivalent
technician-level qualification
by the time they are 30. New
apprenticeship scholarships will
enable the best apprentices to
go on to higher education.

We will open up opportunity
for people from families on low
incomes to enter professions like
the media and law, expanding
paid internships for students.

To increase social mobility,
careers advice for young people,
including for younger children,
will be overhauled, ensuring
much better information and
guidance.

World-class higher
education

Higher education is
fundamental to our national
prosperity. Demand for high-
level skills is strong and growing,
and the supply of good
graduates is an increasingly
important factor in global
economic competition.

We have eliminated up-front
fees paid by parents and
students, and ensured that the
repayment of loans is related

to ability to pay. The higher
education participation rate

for young people from the

most disadvantaged areas has
increased every year since 2004.

The review of higher education
funding chaired by Lord
Browne will report later this
year. Our aim is to continue the
expansion of higher education,
widening access still further,
while ensuring that universities
and colleges have a secure,
long-term funding base that
protects world-class standards in
teaching and research. Ahead
of the review, we have provided
universities with funding to
recruit an extra 20,000 students
this year.

Universities must continue to
raise their game in outreach
to state schools, widening
participation and boosting
social mobility. We will
guarantee mentoring and
support for higher education
applications to all low-income
pupils with the potential for
university study, with extra
summer schools and help
with UCAS applications;

and expand programmes

to encourage highly able
students from low-income
backgrounds to attend Russell
Group universities. We support
universities that already widen
access by taking into account
the context of applicants’
achievement at school.

In the coming years, priority in
the expansion of student places
will be given to Foundation
Degrees and part-time study,

3:7

and to science, technology,
engineering and mathematics
degrees, as well as applied
study in key economic growth
sectors. The choices and views
of students should play an
important part in shaping
courses and teaching. All
universities will be required
clearly to set out how they will
ensure a high-quality learning
experience for students.

The challenge for Britain

To build a better health service by protecting NHS
spending and by shifting to more preventative and
personal care, clear patient guarantees and greater care
in the home. The Tories will not introduce the necessary
reforms, would fail to guarantee access to services,
usher in a care postcode lottery, and put the interests of
patients second.

The next stage of national renewal

¢ Legally binding guarantees for patients including the
right to cancer test results within one week of referral,
and a maximum 18 weeks’ wait for treatment or the
offer of going private.

¢ Preventative healthcare through routine check-ups for
the over-40s and a major expansion of diagnostic testing.

* More personal care, with the right in law to choose from
any provider who meets NHS standards of quality at
NHS costs when booking a hospital appointment, one-
to-one dedicated nursing for all cancer patients, and
more care at home.

¢ The right to choose a GP in your area open at evenings
and weekends, with more services available on the
high-street, personal care plans and rights to individual
budgets.

¢ Access to psychological therapy for those who need it.

The NHS embodies our values
of fairness and social justice

— for 60 years it has been the
embodiment of what it means
to be British. We will always put
the NHS first. In an insecure
world, people need first-class
healthcare they can rely on.
Under Labour, the NHS will

remain a universal health
service, not a second-rate safety
net. Only 15 years ago, the
very existence of the NHS was
in doubt. Now with sustained
investment and reform, the
NHS is delivering high-quality
healthcare in safer and more
convenient ways.

4:2

But to safeguard the NHS in
tougher fiscal times, we need
sustained reform. To prosper in
the future, the NHS will have
to respond to the challenges
facing healthcare systems across
the developed world: new cures
and breakthrough treatments,
an ageing society, an increased
number of people with long-
term conditions, ever higher
public expectations at the same
time.

So we will be tougher in
ensuring value for money, more
determined in demanding the
highest standards of care and in
shifting rapidly to preventative
care. Above all, the interests

of the patient will come first.

No longer passive recipients

of care, patients will be active
partners with enforceable
guarantees, real choice, and
direct control over services.

These changes are essential
to maintain the principle at
the core of the NHS: of care
provided on the basis of need,
not ability to pay.

Protecting the NHS and
investing in the front line

In 1997, health spending as

a share of national income

was the second lowest of

all the major industrialised
countries. The resulting failures
were visible to all: long waits,

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Health

 

outdated buildings, too few
doctors and nurses.

Since then, investment and
reform have turned around the
public’s experience of the NHS.
A generation of new hospitals
has been built, entirely new
services created, and long waits
eliminated. We are undertaking
fundamental changes to
community services, tough
decisions on pay, and a shift in
care from the hospital to the
community.

As we complete our once-in-
a-generation programme of
hospital building, we will refocus
capital investment on primary
and community services so that
we rival the best healthcare
systems in the world with our
ability to identify disease early.

The reforms of recent years will
allow us to do more than ever
to release savings by cutting red
tape and directing resources to
where they matter most. We
will scale down the NHS IT
programme, saving hundreds of
millions of pounds, and over the
next four years, we will deliver
up to £20 billion of efficiencies
in the frontline NHS, ensuring
that every pound is reinvested in
frontline care.

Getting the most from
NHS resources: sustained
investment and reform

We will continue to press
ahead with bold NHS

reforms. All hospitals will
become Foundation Trusts,
with successful FTs given the
support and incentives to take
over those that are under-
performing. Failing hospitals
will have their management
replaced. Foundation Trusts will
be given the freedom to expand
their provision into primary
and community care, and to
increase their private services

— where these are consistent
with NHS values, and provided
they generate surpluses that are
invested directly into the NHS.

We will support an active role
for the independent sector
working alongside the NHS

in the provision of care,
particularly where they bring
innovation — such as in end-of-
life care and cancer services,
and increase capacity. We

will be uncompromising in
expecting high standards from
all NHS services — and in the
coming period we will expect
PCTs to challenge all services
to achieve the highest quality.
Where changes are needed, we
will be fair to NHS services and
staff and give them a chance to
improve, but where they fail to

4:3

do so we will look to alternative
provision.

Patient power will be increased.
Patients requiring elective

care will have the right, in law,
to choose from any provider
who meets NHS standards of
quality at NHS costs. And we
will also increase year-on-year
the payments made to hospitals
linked to patient satisfaction and
quality outcomes — up to ten per
cent of payment.

Prevention and early
intervention

The NHS must be as effective
at preventing ill health as it

is at treating those in need of
care. Prevention and early
intervention will be at the heart
of our plans for a reformed
healthcare system offering
more for every pound we
spend, significantly improving
survival rates for cancer, heart
disease and strokes so that we
are among the very best in the
world.

We all have a responsibility

to look after our own health,
supported by our family and
our employer. The ban on
smoking in public places will
be maintained. Wherever
necessary, we will act to protect
children’s health from tobacco,
alcohol and sunbeds.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Health

 

GPs will be encouraged to keep
their patients healthy through
exercise and healthy eating
advice. The ambitious Change
4 Life programme will support
a more active, health-conscious

country.

We will pioneer better mental
health care and tackle the
scourge of mental illness. Over
the next Parliament more than
8,000 new therapists will ensure
access to psychological therapy
for all who need it as we seek to
change our society’s attitudes to
mental illness.

Empowering NHS staff and
enabling Mutuals

Central to our agenda

for improvement is the
hardworking NHS workforce.
We will continue the process of
empowering staff — freeing them
from bureaucracy and ensuring
they get proper support.

We will expand the role of NHS
nurses, particularly in primary
care, in line with the best clinical
evidence. And across the NHS
we will extend the right for staff,
particularly nurses, to request to
run their own services in the not-
for-profit sector. To strengthen
local accountability, we will
increase the membership of
Foundation Trusts to over three
million by the end of the next
Parliament.

The NHS will benefit from

a period of organisational
stability: we will make no top-
down changes to the structure
of Primary Care Trusts or
Strategic Health Authorities
during the next Parliament, and
we will ensure stability in the
hospital payment system.

Real guarantees and real
choices for patients

People rightly want public
services that are not just
universal but also personal to
their needs. We will expand
patient choice, empowering
patients with information, and
giving individuals the right to
determine the time and place
of treatment. At the heart of
this will be new legally binding
guarantees enshrined in the
NHS constitution:

° The waiting-time guarantee
will ensure that treatment
begins within 18 weeks of
seeing your GP, or the NHS
will find you to go private.

° The cancer guarantee will
ensure that all patients see a
cancer specialist within two
weeks of GP referral and
that all cancer tests will be
completed and the results
received within just one week —
helping save tens of thousands
of lives over the next ten years.

4:4

° The health-check guarantee
will ensure that everyone
between 40 and 74 will
be guaranteed routine
health checks on the NHS,
preventing up to 10,000 heart
attacks and strokes each year.

° The GP access guarantee will
ensure everyone has the right
to choose a GP in their area
offering evening and weekend
opening.

A personal NHS

Je will ensure the NHS suits
the lives of busy families
expanding further the
availability of GP-led health
centres open seven days a week
‘8 til 8’ in towns and cities.
NHS organisations will offer
telephone and online booking
via the NHS Choices website.
Online patient comments about
the quality of any NHS service
will inform people’s choices.

A new national 111 telephone
number will make non-
emergency services far easier for
people to access and book.

Je will bring the NHS closer
to people through a major
expansion in care available at
home, including chemotherapy
and dialysis. More services
will be available from GPs and
through local pharmacists.
Patients will have the right to
register with a GP anywhere
they choose, including near

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Health

 

their place of work. Choice of
when and where you are treated
will be extended whenever
patients are booking routine
appointments.

We will offer more personal
healthcare. All cancer patients
will be offered one-to-one
dedicated nursing for the
duration of their care and

we will work with Marie

Curie Cancer Care and other
providers to guarantee everyone
who wants it the opportunity to
receive palliative care in their
own home at the end of their
lives.

Everyone with a long-term
condition, such as those with
diabetes, will have the right to
a care plan and an individual

budget.

All women will have the right,
wherever it is safe, to a home-
birth, and every expectant
mother will have a named
midwife providing continuity
of care. More mums and

dads will be offered single
rooms if they need to stay

in hospital overnight, and
post-natal care will be further
expanded so that every area
of the country has a Family
Nurse Partnership, supporting
families in greatest need.

With new rights to treatment
come new responsibilities

for patients: patients who fail
to turn up for pre-booked
appointments will not be
guaranteed fast-track treatment.
The NHS Constitution will
guarantee the legal rights of
patients, wherever they live,

to all treatments and drugs
approved by NICE for use in
the NHS. We will continue

to improve the process of
approving new drugs and
treatments so that these can be
made available to NHS patients
more quickly. We will ensure
all leading drugs available
internationally are assessed

by NICE and those which

are deemed effective will be
available within six months of
referral.

We will establish a new
National Care Service working
in partnership with the NHS
to transform the way care is
provided to the elderly and
disabled people.

Safety and cleanliness

We will ensure all hospitals
are clean and safe for both
patients and staff. More than
3,000 matrons across the NHS
will have the power to manage
wards, order deep cleaning,
and report problems directly
to hospital boards. Every
patient who comes into an
NHS hospital will be screened
for MRSA. We will establish

4:5

national standards of infection
control that get tougher every
year and which every hospital
and ward must meet. The safety
regulator will have the power

to close wards, impose fines

or order cleaning wherever
necessary.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Crime and immigration

 

The challenge for Britain

To reduce the fear of crime by protecting frontline
policing while making the police more responsive and
accountable, and taking faster action on anti-social
behaviour. The Tories talk tough but vote soft on
issues from gun crime to DNA retention; would cut
police and PCSO numbers; and favour political police
chiefs over real reform. We will control immigration
with our new Australian-style points-based system —
unlike the arbitrary Tory quota, which would damage
business and growth.

The next stage of national renewal

¢ Provide the funding to maintain police and PCSO
numbers with neighbourhood police teams in every
area, spending 80 per cent of their time on the beat
visible in their neighbourhood; improve police
performance through online police report cards and
ensure failing forces are taken over by the best.

¢ Intervene earlier to prevent crime, with no-nonsense
action to tackle the problems caused by 50,000
dysfunctional families.

¢ Guarantee fast and effective action to deal with anti-
social behaviour, including a right to legal injunctions for
repeat victims, funded by the police or council who let
them down.

¢ Expand tough ‘Community Payback’ for criminals who
don’t go to prison, giving everyone the right to vote on
the work they do.

¢ Control immigration through our Australian-style
points-based system, ensuring that as growth returns
we see rising levels of employment and wages, not
rising immigration, and requiring newcomers to earn
citizenship and the entitlements it brings.

5:2

Britain is far safer now than
when the Tories left office.
Crime is down by more than a
third; violent crime is down by
over 40 per cent, and the risk of
being a victim of crime is the
lowest since 1981. But people
are still worried about binge
drinking, problem families and
anti-social behaviour. We are
committed to tackling these
problems, not talking them up
to run Britain down.

We understand people’s
concerns about immigration —
about whether it will undermine
their wages or job prospects, or
put pressure on public services
or housing — and we have acted.
Asylum claims are down to the
levels of the early 1990s and
net inward migration has fallen.
We will use our new Australian-
style points-based system to
ensure that as growth returns
we see rising employment and
wages, not rising immigration —
but we reject the arbitrary and
unworkable Tory quota.

Protecting frontline
policing

There are now record numbers
of police officers — nearly
17,000 more than in 1997 —
backed up by 16,000 Police
Community Support Officers.
We are committed to giving the
police the resources to maintain
these numbers, with funding

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Crime and immigration

 

assured for the next three
years. To protect the front line
we are making tough choices
elsewhere: continuing to cut
bureaucracy and inefficiency in
procurement, IT and overtime.

Every community now has a
neighbourhood police team
committed to spending at

least 80 per cent of their

time on the beat visible in

their neighbourhood, and
responding to non-emergency
issues within 24 hours. ‘To
ensure that communities

can determine local policing
priorities, neighbourhood police
teams will hold monthly beat
meetings - at which local people
will have a right to hold senior
commanders to account.

We will protect the police

from politicisation, but take
swift action where they are not
performing. Online crime maps
now give everyone monthly
information on crime in their
area, and we have supported
the Policing Inspectorate in
publishing new online ‘report
cards’, comparing how forces
perform. Where a police force
or local Basic Command

Unit consistently fails local
people, we will ensure either
that the senior management
team including the borough
commander or chief constable
is replaced, or it is taken over by
a neighbouring force or BCU.

Early intervention and
preventing crime

We need to do more and act
earlier to stop children going
down the wrong path. So we
will expand Family Nurse
Partnerships to all vulnerable
young mothers, reducing
future crime and behavioural
problems. For the 50,000
most dysfunctional families
who cause misery to their
neighbours, we will provide
Family Intervention Projects
— proven to tackle anti-social
behaviour — a no-nonsense
regime of one-to-one support
with tough sanctions for non-
compliance.

Youth reoffending is now
falling, and the numbers in
youth custody have fallen by
30 per cent. We will expand
US-style street teams which
use youth pastors and vetted
ex-offenders to reach out to
disaffected young people;
Youth Conditional Cautions
which focus on rehabilitation
and reparation; and we will
introduce a preventative
element for all Anti-Social
Behaviour Orders for under
16s. To ensure there are more
things for teenagers to do we
will double the availability of
organised youth activities on
Friday and Saturday nights.

5:3

We will expand joint working
between police and the
probation service to supervise
prolific young offenders after
they get out of prison, and the
use of mentors including vetted
ex-prisoners to meet offenders
‘at the gate’ so they don’t slip
back into crime. And alcohol
treatment places will be trebled
to cover all persistent criminals
where alcohol is identified as a
cause of their crimes.

We need to try new approaches
to solving the most intractable
problems. So we will pioneer
Social Impact Bonds,
encouraging private investors

to support social entrepreneurs
and the third sector — and
harnessing additional
investment for crime prevention
at minimal cost to the taxpayer.
We have shown that Restorative
Justice can increase satisfaction
for victims and the police, and
we will bring in a Restorative
Justice Act to ensure it is
available wherever victims
approve it.

On drugs, our message is clear:
we will not tolerate illegal

drug use. We have reclassified
cannabis to Class B and
banned ‘legal highs’. More
addicts are being treated, with
a higher proportion going

on to drug-free lives. We will
switch investment towards those
programmes that are shown

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Crime and immigration

 

to sustain drug-free lives and
reduce crime.

Tough action on crime and
anti-social behaviour

Crime continued to fall during
the recession, in marked
contrast to the recessions of the
1980s and 1990s. Homicides are
at the lowest level for a decade —
gun murders are at their lowest
for 20 years, and our gun laws
are among the toughest in the
world. We have strengthened
the law on knife crime with jail
more likely, sentences longer,
and more police searches and
scanners — and knife crime has
fallen. We are tackling territorial
youth gangs with specific police
powers, and new approaches
that confront gangs while
supporting those who want to
leave gang life.

Domestic violence has fallen
by over 50 per cent since

1997, reporting of rape has
doubled, and rape convictions
have increased by more

than 50 per cent. But we are
committed to zero tolerance

of violence against women, so
we will continue to drive up
prosecution rates, tackle causes,
and raise awareness — as well
as maintaining women-only
services including a Sexual
Assault Referral Centre in every
area.

Labour is proud to be the

party that legislated first to
criminalise incitement to racial
hatred, religious hatred, and
homophobic hatred — and we
will reverse the Tory attempt to
undermine this latest legislation,
invoking the Parliament Act if
necessary to force it through.

To tackle the binge drinking
which can leave people reluctant
to venture into town centres

at night, we have banned
irresponsible promotions

and strengthened police and
council powers to close down
rowdy pubs and clubs, cracking
down on under-age and public
drinking. We have brought in a
right to petition local authorities
to end 24-hour licensing where
problems arise.

There were no specific powers
against anti-social behaviour in
1997. Now there are ASBOs,
parenting orders and dispersal
powers. Because we know
people want faster action on
ASB, we will guarantee an
initial response to any complaint
within 24 hours. Local
authorities and other agencies
will be required to give people

a named case worker who will
report back on progress, and
escalate action if the problem
persists. All relevant agencies —
not just neighbourhood police
teams — will hold monthly
public meetings to hear people’s

5:4

concerns; all PCSOs will have
stronger powers to tackle ASB;
a ‘Respect’ standard for the
private rented sector will be
introduced; and local ASB
champions will make agencies
work together to tackle cases.

Enforcement will also be
strengthened: we will ensure
that the great majority of
applications for ASBOs

take under a month and

that whenever an ASBO is
breached there is an expectation
of prosecution. And when
someone suffers repeated ASB
and the police, council, courts
or other agencies fail to act,
there must be a stronger form
of redress. So we will legislate
to give people financial support
to pursue legal injunctions, with
the costs met by the agency that
let them down.

Using technology to cut
crime

We will continue to make

full use of CCTV and DNA
technology: new weapons
deployed to strengthen our fight
against crime. We are proud of
our record on civil liberties and
have taken the DNA profiles of
children off the database and
tightened the rules around the
use of surveillance — but we are
also determined to keep our
streets safe.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Crime and immigration

 

CCTV reduces the fear of
crime and anti-social behaviour.
We have funded cameras in
nearly 700 areas, and brought
in a new power for people to
petition their local authority for
more CCTV.

Advances in DNA technology
have been critical in solving
serious crimes — last year alone
there were 832 positive matches
to the DNA database in cases of
rape, murder and manslaughter.
Labour will ensure that the most
serious offenders are added to
the database no matter where or
when they were convicted — and
retain for six years the DNA
profiles of those arrested but not
convicted.

The new biometric ID scheme
which already covers foreign
nationals will be offered to

an increasing number of
British citizens, but will not be
compulsory for them. It will
help fight the growing threat of
identity theft and fraud, as well
as crime, illegal immigration
and terrorism. In the next
Parliament ID cards and the ID
scheme will be self-financing.
The price of the passport and
ID cards together with savings
from reduced fraud across the
public services will fully cover
the costs of the scheme.

Punishment and reform

We have provided over 26,000
more prison places since 1997.
There are more criminals in
prison — not because crime is
rising but because violent and
serious offenders are going

to prison for longer. We will
ensure a total of 96,000 prison
places by 2014. More EU and
other foreign prisoners will be
transferred abroad, and we will
work to reduce the number of
women, young and mentally

ill people in prison. Any spare
capacity generated will reduce
costs while protecting the public.

For offenders not sentenced to
prison we have brought in tough
new ‘Community Payback’:
hard work in public, wearing
orange jackets. We will extend
nationwide the right for local
people to vote on what work
offenders do to pay back to the
communities they have harmed.

We will always put the victim
first in the criminal justice
system. We are creating a
National Victims Service to
guarantee all victims of crime
and anti-social behaviour seven-
day-a-week cover and a named,
dedicated worker offering one-
to-one support through the trial
and beyond. The compensation
offenders have to pay to victims
has been increased, and we

will now ensure victims get this
payment up front.

5:5

To help protect frontline
services, we will find greater
savings in legal aid and the
courts system — increasing the
use of successful ‘virtual courts’
which move from arrest, to trial,
to sentencing in hours rather
than weeks or months. We will
use the tax system to claw back
from higher-earning offenders
a proportion of the costs of
prison. Asset confiscation

will be a standard principle

in sentencing, extended from
cash to houses and cars. Every
community will have the right
to vote on how these assets

are used to pay back to the
community.

Terrorism and organised
crime

Our counter-terrorism approach
is one of the most sophisticated
in the world, and investment
has trebled since 2001, with
thousands more counter-
terrorist police and a doubling
of security service numbers.

We will continue to give the
police the tools they need to fight
terrorism while giving Parliament
and the courts oversight to
ensure these powers are not
overused. We condemn torture,
and our police and security
services will not co-operate with
those who use torture. We will
develop our Prevent strategy to
combat extremism.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Crime and immigration

 

We will continue to make
Britain a hostile place for
organised criminals, harassing
them with asset seizures, tax
investigations and other powers;
strengthening the Serious
Organised Crime Agency and
encouraging police forces to co-
operate across force boundaries
and international borders; and
responding quickly to new
threats including cybercrime.

Strong borders and
immigration controls

We are committed to an
immigration system that
promotes and protects British
values. People need to know
that immigration is controlled,
that the rules are firm and fair,
and that there is support for
communities in dealing with
change.

Our borders are stronger than
ever. A new Border Agency
has police-level powers and
thousands more immigration
officers, 100 per cent of visas
are now biometric, and new
electronic border controls will
be counting people in and out
by the end of the year. Asylum
claims are back down to early
1990s levels, and the cost of
asylum support to the taxpayer
has been cut by half in the last
six years. Genuine refugees will
continue to receive protection.

Our new Australian-style points-
based system is ensuring we

get the migrants our economy
needs, but no more. We will
gradually tighten the criteria
in line with the needs of the
British economy and the values
of British citizenship, and step
up our action against illegal
immigration. There will be

no unskilled migration from
outside the EU. Skilled jobs are
now advertised here first for
four weeks with more vacancies
going to local workers, and
public procurement will in
future give priority to local
people. The points-based
system will be used to control
migration with limits for high-
skilled workers and university
students. As growth returns

we want to see rising levels of
employment and wages, not
rising immigration.

We recognise that immigration
can place pressures on housing
and public services in some
communities so we will expand
the Migration Impact Fund,
paid for by contributions from
migrants, to help local areas.

We know that migrants who
are fluent in English are more
likely to work and find it easier
to integrate. So as well as
making our English test harder,
we will ensure it is taken by all
applicants before they arrive.
Local councils and other public

5:6

services should keep funding
for translation services to a
minimum. Many public-sector
workers are already required
to meet minimum standards of
English; we will build on this to
ensure that all employees who
have contact with the public
possess an appropriate level of
English language competence.

Because we believe coming

to Britain is a privilege and

not a right, we will break

the automatic link between
staying here for a set period
and being able to settle or gain
citizenship. In future, staying
will be dependent on the points-
based system, and access to
benefits and social housing will
increasingly be reserved for
British citizens and permanent
residents — saving the taxpayer
hundreds of millions of pounds
each year. We will continue

to emphasise the value we
place on citizenship, and the
responsibilities as well as rights
it brings, through the citizenship
pledge and ceremony, and by
strengthening the test of British
values and traditions.

Supporting families throughout life

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Families and older people

 

The challenge for Britain

To support all families in a rapidly changing world that
places new and rising demands on all of us. We will help
families to realise their aspirations — whatever their
circumstances — and we recognise the huge contribution
older people make to society and to family life. The
Tories propose a marriage tax allowance that is divisive
and unfair, will neglect growing care needs among frail
elderly people and disabled adults, and prioritise only
the privileged few.

The next stage of national renewal

¢ More help for parents to balance work and family life,
with a ‘Father’s Month’ of flexible paid leave.

¢ A new Toddler Tax Credit of £4 a week from 2012 to give
more support to all parents of young children — whether
they want to stay at home or work.

¢ The right to request flexible working for older workers,
with an end to default retirement at 65, enabling more
people to decide for themselves how long they choose to
keep working.

¢ A new National Care Service to ensure free care in the
home for those with the greatest care needs and a cap
on the costs of residential care so that everyone’s homes
and savings are protected from care charges after two
years in a care home.

¢ A re-established link between the Basic State Pension
and earnings from 2012; and help for ten million
people to build up savings through new Personal Pension
Accounts.

Strong families are the bedrock
of our society. Secure and stable
relationships between parents,
their children, grandparents
and other family members are
the foundation on which strong

communities are built. Today,
parents have rising aspirations
for their children and greater
choice about how they lead
their family and working lives.

6:2

Our society is ageing as

many more of us live long

and fulfilling lives, active in

our communities as we enjoy
retirement. Retired people bring
great strengths to our society —
as carers for family members,
active grandparents, and pillars
of local civic life.

Substantial challenges still
remain. Today, tough financial
times are placing extra pressures
on families — adding to the daily
challenges many already face

in going out to work to earn

a decent income, look after a
home, and care for children or
older relatives. In many families
these pressures fall particularly
on mothers. And like every
industrialised country across the
world, we need to adjust to an
ageing society — where demand
for health provision will grow,
and where the need for care will
rise rapidly.

We need services that help
families manage these new
pressures without creating huge
additional costs. We need to

go further to secure fairness in
later life and ensure that those
who plan and save for their
retirement are rewarded for
doing so. The additional costs
and burdens of old age must not
fall disproportionately on those
who have made provision for
themselves and their families.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Families and older people

 

Strengthening family life

Children thrive best in families
in which relationships are

stable, loving and strong. We
support couples who want to get
married and for whom marriage
offers the best environment

to raise children. Marriage is
fundamental to our society,

but financial support should

be directed at all children, not
just those with married parents.
We reject proposals that would
skew resources to the wealthy, or
penalise loving and committed
adults who, for whatever reason,
are not married, and stigmatise
their children.

In today’s fast-changing world,
parents want to be confident
they have the information

and choices they need to
protect their children. We will
continue to promote internet
safety for children, building on
the recommendations of Dr
Tanya Byron’s review. We will
support parents who challenge
aggressive or sexualised
commercial marketing. We
will ask Consumer Focus to
develop a website for parents
to register their concerns about
sexualised products aimed at
their children.

We have established the Family
Justice Review to examine
reforms to the family justice
system making it more child-

focused and family-centred.
Parents who are clear their
relationship has broken down
and cannot be restored need
more help to reach agreement
about future arrangements early
on in the process, for the benefit
of their children.

No child left behind in
poverty

No child should have to grow
up in poverty. The current
pressures on the personal
finances of families make the
goal of ending child poverty
more urgent than ever. So we
will continue to make progress
towards our historic goal of
ending child poverty by 2020,
building on the 2010 Child
Poverty Act.

In the next Parliament, we will
focus on helping families into
jobs and out of poverty. Where
parents, especially mothers, want
to stay at home or work part-
time we will do more to help
families with younger children,
reducing poverty in those vital
early years of a child’s life. We
will ensure that work always pays
for hard-working lone parents.
The child element of the Child
Tax Credit will be increased

by £4 a week for families with
children aged one and two from
2012, paid regardless of the
marital status of the parents —

a Toddler Tax Credit.

6:3

A better work-life balance

More than ever, families want
support in balancing the
pressures of work and home. To
help parents strike this balance
we will extend real choice to
parents over how they organise
their parental leave.

We have already increased
paid maternity leave to nine
months. We continue to believe
that one year’s paid leave in
the baby’s first year would

be of great benefit to parents
and their children. However,
in the current economic
circumstances, progress will
inevitably be tougher. So we
will introduce more flexibility
to the nine months’ paid leave
that mothers currently enjoy

— allowing them to share this
entitlement with fathers after a
minimum of six months.

Ve will introduce a new
Fathers’ Month, four weeks
of paid leave rather than the
current two. We will also work
with employers on how this can
be taken flexibly — for instance,
two weeks around the birth, and
the remaining two weeks taken
flexibly over the first year of the
baby’s life, including the option
of sharing these extra weeks
between parents. This will be
paid for as savings accrue from
housing benefit through our
reforms.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Families and older people

 

Our new agenda for families
must reflect the change in
working patterns that has
emerged over the last 20 years.
A high proportion of parents
no longer work the traditional
day, while increasing numbers
of families depend on part-time
work to manage their caring
and job responsibilities. Many
still struggle to find quality part-
time jobs that use their skills, so
we will promote the creation of
more highly skilled, quality jobs
for parents who choose to work
more flexibly.

We created the right to request
flexible working for parents
and carers so that millions of
individuals and their families
could exercise more choice
about how to balance their
work and caring responsibilities.
But as the burden of caring
increases in our society we
need to go further. By the end
of the next Parliament we will
ensure that the right to flexible
working is extended for older
people, recognising that many,
including grandparents, want
to vary their hours to the
benefit of their families and

to accommodate changing
lifestyles. We will consult on the
age at which this right should

apply.

Helping older people who
want to work

Age discrimination in the
workplace has been banned.
As well as promoting flexible
working, we will now proceed
to end default retirement at 65,
with a review to establish the
right way in which to support
more people to work longer
should they choose to do so. To
expand the choices available
for those wishing to work after
retirement, we will enable
people aged 60 and over to
claim Working Tax Credit if
they work at least 16 hours a
week, rather than 30 hours as
at present.

A good quality of life in
older age

The vast majority of older
people are well and active,
helping to strengthen our
families, communities and
wider society. Many charities,
voluntary organisations and
schools value and rely on the
contribution of older people
and we support the growing
number of excellent initiatives
creating greater understanding
across the generations. We

will continue to support older
people in getting involved in
their community by providing
matched funding for community
projects.

6:4

Parents who are able to call

on grandparents to help

with childcare, or during
emergencies, know how
essential their support is to a
strong family life. Grandparents
who give up work to help care
for their grandchildren must
not lose out, so they will receive
National Insurance Credits
towards their state pension. We
will remove the requirement
on grandparents to apply for
the court’s permission before
making an application for
contact with their grandchildren
and we will ensure that
grandparents and other family
members are always given first
consideration for adoption or
fostering.

Better pensions for all,
tackling pensioner poverty

Our commitment to fairness
has put pensioner poverty

at the top of our agenda for
Britain. Older-age poverty has
been dramatically reduced
compared to a generation ago.
We recognise that it is right
that pensions should rise in line
with the nation’s wealth. So to
increase security in retirement,
we will restore the link between
the basic state pension and
earnings from 2012 —a link
broken by the Tories in 1980.
Pension credit, which ensures
that no pensioner need live on
less than £132.60 per week

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Families and older people

 

or £202.40 for couples, and
supports the income of 2.7
million pensioner households,
will also rise in line with
earnings. Six in ten pensioners
currently pay no income tax.

We will continue to provide help
to pensioners, with the Winter
Fuel Payments (maintained

this winter at £250 for those
over state retirement age and
£400 for those aged 80 or over);
concessionary public-transport
fares; free TV licences for the
over-75s; and free eye tests and
prescriptions.

Saving for pensions

As a country, we need to

save more for retirement —
individuals, employers, and
the Government will all need
to play their part. We will
support ten million low-and
middle-income people to build
up savings through automatic
enrolment in occupational
pensions and new Personal
Pension Accounts, ensuring that
everyone in work is entitled to
matched contributions from
employers and government.

We will continue to make
pension saving more attractive
for individuals through
favourable tax treatment. And
we will promote stakeholder
pensions offering simple, low-
cost and flexible products,

obliging employers to provide
access to a pension for all
employees. We will continue to
protect pension schemes when
a firm’s company scheme goes
bust. We are also introducing
more flexibility to make it easier
for companies to run good
schemes.

Between now and 2020 the
State Pension Age for woman
will rise to 65; and between
2024 and 2046, it will rise to
68 for both men and women,
helping to keep state pensions
affordable in the long term.
The reforms we are making to
public-sector pensions will keep
them sustainable and affordable
over the long term.

The National Care Service
and an age-friendly NHS

The cornerstone of a fair future
is ensuring everyone who needs
care and support, whether
through old age or disability,

is properly looked after. We

will establish a new National
Care Service and forge a new
settlement for our country as
enduring as that which the
Labour Government built after
1945. It will be a new settlement
for all those who need care,

for the carers who devote their
time and energy for the good of
others, and for families across
the country. The care of both
older people and disabled adults

6:5

will be transformed; unfair
postcode lotteries removed;
more people will be looked after
at home; and family homes

and savings will be protected
from catastrophic care costs.

To provide independence and
control for everyone with a care
need we will continue to expand
the use of individual budgets.
And to drive up standards, we
will develop a skilled and highly
motivated workforce.

The first stage of reform will

be to create a step-change in
the provision of services in the
home and in our communities.
From 2011 we will protect more
than 400,000 of those with the
greatest needs from all charges
for care in the home, and we
will create a national physio
support service helping people
in every area of the country to
regain their independence and
confidence after a crisis or the
first time they need care. These
services are essential if we are to
ensure more people are looked
after in their homes and overall
costs are to be controlled. They
will be funded through savings
and efficiencies in the health
budget and in local government.

During the next Parliament,
the second stage of reform
will centre on the development
of national standards and
entitlements to ensure high-
quality care for all, and an end

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Families and older people

 

to the unfair postcode lotteries
that affect too many families.
We also want to remove the
fear that families will lose the
family home in order to pay
for care bills. So, from 2014,
the National Care Service will
cap the costs of residential care
so that everyone’s homes and
savings are protected from care
charges after two years. We
will pay for this through our
decision to freeze Inheritance
Tax Thresholds until 2014-15,
yy supporting more people over
he State Pension Age to stay
in work if they so wish, and
hrough efficiencies across the
NHS and the care system.

The final stage of reform, after
2015, will be a comprehensive
National Care Service, free at
he point of use not just for
older people, but all adults with
an eligible care need whoever
hey are, wherever they live and
whatever condition leads to
hem needing care. At the start
of the next Parliament we will
establish a Commission to reach
a consensus on the right way
of financing this system. The
Commission will determine the
options which should be open
to individuals so that people
can have choice and flexibility
about how they pay and to
ensure that the National Care
Service is funded in a fair way.
The Commission will make
recommendations in time for

 

implementation of the third
stage of reform after 2015, once
these proposals have been put to
the public at a general election.

Across the NHS we will improve
and personalise care for the
elderly and their families. This
will mean more NHS services
available in the home, with
greater use of tele-care and
personal nursing; reform of

the GP contract to help ensure
those with late-life depression
and anxiety are diagnosed and
supported; and better services
for those with dementia and
Alzheimer’s so that every area
of the country has access

to psychological therapy,
counselling and memory clinics.
There will be an end to the age-
discrimination that has too often
seen older people disadvantaged
in the provision of health
services.

The challenge for Britain

To build on the renaissance that British sport, culture
and the arts have enjoyed in the last decade in the

new climate of financial restraint. The voluntary and
community sector has a new lease of life, but needs its
potential to be fully harnessed. The Tories have always
neglected the arts and sport, regarding them as an easy

target for cuts.

The next stage of national renewal

« A golden decade of sport with the 2012 Olympics as a
great national and world-wide celebration.

¢ Registered Supporters Trusts enabled to buy stakes in
their club bringing mutualism to the heart of football.

* Operational independence for major museums and
galleries, with more lottery funding returning to the
arts, sport and culture after 2012.

¢ Protection for the post offices and pubs on which

community life depends.

¢ The BBC’s independence upheld; and Britain
equipped with a world-leading digital and broadband

infrastructure.

The sporting, artistic and
cultural life of Britain is rich
and diverse, internationally
renowned, and as vital to our
quality of life as it is to our
national prosperity. Since
1997, our creative industries,
arts and sport have become
the envy of the world. As the
2012 Olympics draw near,
we will make the most of our
place in the world’s spotlight

to showcase Britain, getting
more people playing sport and
attracting more visitors to the
UK.

Culture and the arts are vital to
a modern economy. But they
stand for more than material
success, reminding us that
society is not just a marketplace.
Promoting well-being means
sustaining the community

7:2

institutions that we most
cherish, and protecting those
areas of our public life that
embody the common good.

2012: creating an
Olympic generation

Hosting the 2012 Olympics
provides a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to showcase our
country’s great sporting talent.
The eyes of the world will be
on us as Team GB inspires
enthusiasm and national
pride. Our aim is to achieve
outstanding medal success at
the Olympics and Paralympics,
with a talent development
system striving for excellence,
and successful British athletes
spanning all disciplines and
events.

The Games will deliver a
golden legacy for future
generations, ushering in a new
era of sporting excellence. The
Olympics are already inspiring
a new generation of British
volunteers: over a quarter of

a million young people have
signed up to help run the
Games.

We will ensure that the
Olympics are delivered on time
and on budget, to the highest
standards. Britain will be the
first Olympic hosts to create a
world-class sports system, from
elite level to the grass roots. The

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Communities and creative Britain

 

impact of the Olympics will

be felt throughout the country,
helping to boost the UK tourist
industry.

Sport for All

We approach 2012 with a
proud record. Investment in
sport has increased eightfold.
We have begun a renaissance of
competitive sport in our schools,
investing as never before in our
sporting facilities. Taking part in
sport uncovers talent, improves
physical fitness, and encourages
important social skills. We are
providing more resources to
give every child the opportunity
to do at least five hours’ sport
per week. This will be provided
through extended schools,
community sports clubs and
3,000 new Olympic-inspired
sports clubs. We will invest in a
new national network of school
sports coaches to increase

the quality and quantity of
coaching in some of the most
deprived areas.

This will be backed by a Pupil
Guarantee ensuring that every
pupil should have access to
regular competitive sport along
with coaching, a choice of
different sports, and pathways
to elite and club development.
We will continue our investment
in free swimming for children
and the over-60s. People

of all ages and abilities can

apply to join one of the tens
of thousands of sports clubs
receiving public funding. And
there are over half a million
more adults taking part in
regular sporting activity than a
decade ago.

Protecting the integrity of
professional sport is vital:
we will toughen measures

to combat cheating and the
use of illegal substances in
sport. We will work with
governing authorities to
ensure that professional
clubs are accountable to
their stakeholders, and run
transparently on sound
financial principles, with
greater involvement of

local communities and
supporter representation.
Sports governing bodies will
be empowered to scrutinise
takeovers of clubs, ensuring
they are in the long-term
interests of the club and the
sport. We will develop proposals
to enable registered Supporters
Trusts to buy stakes in their
club.

The 2010s promise to be a
golden decade for British sport:
as well as the 2012 Olympics,
we will host the 2013 Rugby
League World Cup, the 2014
Commonwealth Games, and
the 2015 Rugby Union World
Cup. We aim to bring more
major international sporting

7:3

competitions to Britain,
beginning with our current
partnership with the English FA
to bring the 2018 World Cup to
England.

Arts, culture and museums

We have made unprecedented
investment in Britain’s cultural
life, widening access by
introducing free admission to
museums and galleries. Every
child and young person should
be entitled to five hours of art,
music and culture per week,
through learning to play a
musical instrument, visiting
local museums and joining film
clubs, or taking part in local
theatre. Through Creative
Partnerships we are ensuring
that young people in the most
deprived parts of the country
are able to fulfil their artistic
talents by working with local
arts and cultural organisations.

We have provided the first
nationwide programme of free
theatre to young people; now
we will build on the success

of the National Theatre’s

£10 Season to work with
theatres and sponsors to
provide reduced-rate tickets for
theatrical productions around
Britain. Our national cultural
life and creative industries can
prosper only by developing
young artistic talent. Creative
Bursaries will support the most

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Communities and creative Britain

 

artistically gifted young people
in their early professional
careers.

So that our cultural facilities
remain world-class, charities,
businesses and cultural
organisations must collaborate
more closely in the future. We
will review how incentives for
philanthropic support can

be strengthened. Our major
museums and galleries should

be operationally independent of

government, so we will legislate
to ensure their managerial and
financial autonomy.

We will maintain our
commitment to free admissions,
encouraging people of all
ages and a wide range of
backgrounds to visit. Every
child will have lifetime library
membership from birth.
Britain is enriched by its
unique historical heritage.

We will review the structures
that oversee English Heritage,
putting mutual principles at
the heart of its governance so
that people can have a direct
say over the protection and
maintenance of Britain’s built
historical legacy.

We will give public institutions
new rights to borrow works of
art from the national collection,
so that more people can benefit
from access to our national
artistic heritage.

National Lottery funding is
more in tune with people’s
priorities than ever. We

will promote greater public
involvement in the way that
National Lottery proceeds

are spent on good causes. A
proportion of Lottery funding
is going to the Olympics. After
2012, this proportion will return
to culture, heritage and sport.

Improving your community

The nature of the places

in which we live matters
enormously. We are happier,
more engaged and better able
to enjoy family life where there
are safe and welcoming public
spaces, good local amenities
and buildings in which we can
take pride.

Britain’s towns and cities have
undergone a renaissance in the
last decade. Our great cities
have been rebuilt and revitalised
and dilapidated schools and
hospitals replaced with modern
buildings. We will continue

to promote excellence in
architecture and design, helping
to foster civic pride and build
world-class places in which
people want to live and work.

We have introduced new design
standards for schools, to ensure
the very best architecture and
building design; we will extend

7:4

these to all new government-
funded building programmes.

Protecting community life

Strong community life also
depends on protecting the
places in which people come
together. To give families access
to good recreational facilities,
we are investing £235 million
to create new or refurbished
play spaces and adventure
playgrounds. We will protect
the Post Office network, so that
it can fulfil its historic role as a
trusted institution serving the
community.

The local pub and social club
are also hubs of community
life. Too many pubs have closed
that could have been sustained
by local people. We will support
pubs that have a viable future
with a new fund for community
ownership in 2010-11. Councils
must take full account of the
importance of pubs to the local
community when assessing
proposals that change their

use, and we will make it more
difficult to demolish pubs.
Restrictive covenants applied by
pub companies to property sales
will be curbed and flexibility for
pubs to provide related services
promoted, making it easier

to have live entertainment
without a licence. A non-tie
option should be available for
pub tenants; we will act if the

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Communities and creative Britain

 

industry fails to make progress
on this.

To protect the character of
their areas, local authorities
now have greater powers to
reject applications for lap-
dancing clubs and we will

give councils new powers to
oppose gambling licences if
there are too many betting
shops operating in a high street.
The ‘cleaner neighbourhoods’
legislation will be used to clamp
down on litter, fly-tipping and
vandalism. We will extend the
use of participatory budgeting
to give local people a stronger
say. Community Land ‘Trusts
enable local people to purchase
and run local amenities and
assets in their area such as
youth facilities, parks and open
spaces. We will promote the
transfer of buildings and land
to the ownership or control

of voluntary and community
groups.

Supporting social
enterprise

The Social Investment Bank
will make additional capital
available to social enterprises
with an initial endowment of
£75 million funded by dormant
accounts alongside existing
funding streams. We will
promote the creation of more
social enterprise hubs in every

community — helping more to
get off the ground.

We will extend the right

of public-sector workers

to request that they deliver
frontline services through a
social enterprise. Public-sector
workers in the NHS currently
enjoy this right. We will extend
this to more public services,
including social care, with
greater community involvement
in their governance.

The new mutualism

There is growing interest

in co-operative and mutual
organisations that people trust,
and that have the capacity

to unleash creativity and
innovation, creating new jobs
and services — particularly in
disadvantaged neighbourhoods
where traditional approaches
have failed in the past. We
want to see more local
organisations run on co-
operative principles with an
expansion of Community
Interest Companies and third-
sector mutual organisations
that reinvest profits for the
public good. We will promote
this through the Co-operative
Party, Business Link, enterprise
education and the Regional
Development Agencies. ‘To give
more people a stake in a highly
valued national asset, British
Waterways will be turned into

7:5

a mutually owned co-operative.
We will promote the use of
community shares that support
investment in football clubs,
pubs, renewable energy and
shops.

A vibrant voluntary sector

Britain has among the highest
levels of voluntary membership
in the world. We strongly

value the independence

of the voluntary and
community sector, including its
campaigning role, and will act
to maintain it. There will be
greater support for third-sector
organisations in competing for
public-sector contracts, ensuring
there is a level playing field with
the public and private sectors.

/e will consult on putting the
Compact Commission — which
sets guidelines for effective
partnership working between
government and the third sector
in Britain — on a statutory
footing, and ensure greater
support for the Compact at
local level.

All young people should be
active and engaged in their
communities, so that it becomes
a normal part of growing up

to undertake service in the
community. We are taking
forward plans for a National
Youth Community Service, with
the goal that all young people
contribute at least 50 hours to

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Communities and creative Britain

 

their communities by the age
of 19, building on citizenship
education and community
engagement in schools.

Faith is enormously important
to millions of people in Britain,
shaping their values and the
way they live. We respect the
importance of belief and
welcome the contribution that
people of faith make to our
communities and society more
widely. We will actively combat
extremist groups who promote
fear, hatred and violence on the
basis of faith or race.

Britain’‘s creative
industries

In every nation and region of
Britain a wealth of creative
talent — in industries ranging
from film to fashion, design and
video games ~ has flourished,
and creative industries now
account for ten per cent of the
national economy.

The strength of Britain’s film
industry is a source of pride.
Through Labour’s film tax
credit we have ensured that
Britain — with its unique range
of skills and facilities — is the
right place to invest in film
production. So that films can
be enjoyed more widely too,
we will maintain the film tax
credit and create a merged
British Film Institute and UK

Film Council to establish a
single body to promote film
production and film heritage.
Subject to state aid clearance,
we will introduce a tax relief for
the UK video games industry.
We will support film festivals
around the country, and
establish a new biennial Festival
of Britain, beginning in 2013,
showcasing our major cultural
achievements and young British
talent across all of our creative
industries.

The BBC is the most admired
and trusted broadcaster in the
world: respected internationally
for its objectivity and its creative
excellence, and here in Britain
as a pillar of our cultural life.
We support an independent and
world-class BBC at the heart of
a vibrant public broadcasting
system. Our strong support for
its editorial independence and
the licence fee that finances

the BBC’s programmes and
activities will continue. The
BBC Trust should fully involve
the public in decision-making.
The licence-fee is guaranteed
for the ten-year Royal Charter
that took effect on 1 January
2007.

Channel 4 will continue as
a public-service broadcaster
providing distinctive
competition to the BBC,
alongside ITV and Channel
5. We are committed to

7:6

maintaining plurality in
regional news provision. We
will fund three regional news
programme pilots from the
digital switchover under-spend
in the current licence-fee
period.

The digital revolution is
transforming the world of
broadcasting. We are working
with the BBC and Digital
UK to ensure that TV’s
digital switch-over takes place
smoothly by 2012, providing
financial support and helping
elderly people and the most
vulnerable households in the
UK. To ensure we preserve
competition and protect
children and consumers on the
Internet, we will safeguard the
independence of Ofcom.

We are extending broadband
access to every business and
home, ensuring universal access
within a decade to high-speed
broadband across the country.
We will update the intellectual
property framework that is
crucial to the creative industries
—and take further action to
tackle online piracy.

The challenge for Britain

To be on track for the transition to a low-carbon
economy in a way that is fair, secure and helps create
the jobs of the future, as we protect and enhance our
natural environment and quality of life. For the Tories
the environment has been all about image — by failing
to deliver on our renewable energy targets, reversing
our planning reforms and giving up on our new
industrial strategy, they would put Labour's low-carbon

revolution in jeopardy.

The next stage of national renewal

¢ Achieve around 40 per cent low-carbon electricity by
2020 and create 400,000 new green jobs by 2015.

¢ Make greener living easier and fairer through ‘pay as
you save’ home energy insulation, energy-bill discounts
for pensioners and requiring landlords to properly

insulate rented homes.

° Move towards a ‘zero waste’ Britain, banning
recyclable and biodegradable materials from landfill.

¢ Link together new protected areas of habitat; maintain
the Green Belt; increase forest and woodland areas.

¢ Ensure fairness for food producers through EU reform
and a Supermarkets Ombudsman; and support post
offices, shops and pubs in rural communities.

Britain is a transition
economy: from high carbon
to low carbon. To avert the
catastrophe of unchecked
climate change we have begun
the shift to a different kind of
economic future. Our vision is
of a society where economic
prosperity and quality of life
come not from exploiting the
natural world but from its
defence.

This is a huge challenge,

not just for Britain but for

the world. Living within our
environmental means will
require a dramatic shift using
resources more efficiently and
reducing waste. We will need
to find new ways of balancing
the multiple uses of land:
safeguarding food security at
the same time as enriching our
natural environment; protecting

8:2

distinctive landscapes while
enabling environmentally
sensitive development.

Labour’s environmental agenda
reflects our values. Only active
government can shape markets
to prioritise green growth and
job creation. Environmental
sustainability cannot be left to
individuals and businesses acting
alone. We believe that people
have the right to a healthy
environment. That means giving
everyone access to the beauty
and amenity of natural places;
we want to make it easier to live
in a sustainable way whatever
your standard of living.

We believe in local community
action — enabling both elected
councils and community and
social enterprises to provide
environmental benefits to local
people. We are internationalists
too: only co-operative global
action — including a strong
European Union ~ can tackle
climate change and protect the
world’s precious environments.

Towards a green economy

We have established low-carbon
policy as one of the principal
engines of our economic
recovery and future growth.
Our aim is to create 400,000
new green jobs by 2015.

The foundation of Labour’s
approach has been leadership

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Green recovery

 

on climate change. The 2008
Climate Change Act made
Britain the first country in the
world to put its carbon targets
into law.

Internationally, we will continue
to work for an ambitious, fair
and legally binding climate
change agreement, building

on the Copenhagen Accord to
limit global temperature rises
to two degrees Celsius. In the
next Parliament, we will use our
leadership in the EU to push
for a strengthening of Europe’s
2020 emission reductions from
20 to 30 per cent by 2020 as
part of an ambitious global
deal. This would mean the UK
increasing its current target

of a 34 per cent reduction. As
part of the negotiations, we
believe Europe should agree

a second Kyoto commitment
period, provided all countries
are brought within a clear legal
framework.

Developing countries need help
to adapt, reduce deforestation
and emissions. From 2013 we
will provide climate assistance
additional to our commitment
to provide 0.7 per cent of
national income in overseas aid.
No more than ten per cent of
our aid will be counted towards
climate finance.

Clean energy

This Government is
revolutionising Britain’s energy
policy. We are building a clean
energy system which will
reduce Britain’s dependence
on imported oil and gas and
increase our energy security.
We are planning for around

40 per cent of our electricity to
come from low-carbon sources
by 2020 — renewables, nuclear
and clean fossil fuels. A major
drive for energy efficiency

will be enhanced by a ‘smart
grid’ using new information
technologies.

We are committed to meeting
15 per cent of our energy
demand from renewables by
2020. We already have more
offshore wind-power than any
other country in the world, and
our plans could see this increase
up to 40 times, alongside other
renewable technologies such

as tidal and marine, solar and
sustainable bio-energy. We

will make a decision early in
the next Parliament on the
feasibility of alternative options
for a tidal energy project on the
Severn, taking full account of
the environmental impacts.

We have taken the decisions
to enable a new generation of
nuclear power stations, and a
programme of four clean coal
plants with carbon capture

8:3

and storage technology with a
levy to fund them. We are the
only Government in the world
to have banned new unabated
coal-fired power stations.

To secure this investment —
likely to be worth around £150
billion over the next decade —
we have reformed the planning
system to reduce delays for
major infrastructure. We will
now reform the regulatory
system to provide the certainty
that investors need, and create a
Green Investment Bank to help
finance this transformation.

In stimulating the sustainable
use of resources, we will

move towards a ‘zero waste’
Britain, banning recyclable

and biodegradable materials
from landfill and continuing the
move towards universal water
metering in areas of water stress.

Our industrial strategy will
ensure that the drive to green
our economy will create jobs
and businesses in Britain in the
manufacture and installation of
low-carbon and environmental
technologies.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Green recovery

 

Making green living easier
and fairer

Everyone can play their part in
reducing carbon emissions and
protecting the environment.
Through our requirement that
energy companies provide
subsidies for insulation, we will
ensure that all household lofts
and cavity walls are insulated,
where practical, by 2015. By
2020 every home will have a
smart meter to help control
energy use and enable cheaper
tariffs; and we will enable seven
million homes to have a fuller
“eco-upgrade’.

We will legislate to introduce
“Pay As You Save’ financing
schemes under which home-
energy improvements can

be paid for from the savings
they generate on energy bills.
Already with our new ‘feed-
in tariffs’ and incentive for
renewable heat, households
fitting micro-generation
technologies such as solar
can earn financial rewards
from the energy they generate
themselves.

Labour is determined to end
fuel poverty and create a fair
energy system for all. We

will introduce a new Warm
Home Standard for social
housing and regulate landlords
so that privately rented
accommodation is properly

insulated. We have legislated for
compulsory contributions from
energy companies to protect the
vulnerable.

To deliver the fairest deal for
consumers, we will ensure
greater competition in the
energy supply market. And we
will review the role of the water
regulator, Ofwat, to ensure
customers get the best deal and
their voice is heard in price-
setting

Encouraging greener living is
about communities, not just
individuals. We will devolve
power to local councils to hold
energy companies to account
for community energy efficiency
programmes, and give them
powers to develop local energy
systems such as renewables

and district heating. We want
local people to have a stake

in local renewable energy
projects such as wind farms.

So we will support community
organisations, co-ops and social
enterprises to provide energy
services, meaning lower prices
through bulk purchasing, and
the development of small-scale
renewables.

We have made it far easier

for everyone to recycle. From
nine per cent when we came
to office, now 37 per cent of
municipal waste is recycled or
composted. Next we will drive

8:4

the introduction of ‘recycling
on the go’, with separated
public bins on the street and in
shopping centres.

We have championed the
increasing desire of many

to grow their own food,
encouraging local authorities
to provide more allotments
and getting kids to learn about
growing food in school. We
will work with community
organisations to make it easier
to find and use sites for ‘grow
your own’ schemes.

Valuing nature for
everyone

For millions of people the
British countryside, and the
parks and commons of our
towns and cities, provide solace
from the pressures of modern
life. The riches of Britain’s
biodiversity — our native species,
both rare and commonplace —
depend on them.

We are committed not only to
protecting but also to enhancing
our natural environment, and
enabling it to be enjoyed by all.
The area of Green Belt has
increased over the last decade —
and we intend to sustain it. We
will maintain the target that 60
per cent of new development
should be on brownfield land.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Green recovery

 

We have created two National
Parks in the New Forest and
South Downs, and given the
public a Right to Roam our
mountains, moors and heaths.
We will now extend this to the
whole English coastline.

Competing pressures — from
greater food production to
housing and natural flood
defences — are making the
management of land resources
ever more challenging. We will
introduce a new framework
for managing our land that
can more effectively reconcile
these pressures. We will put
forward new areas for protected
landscape and habitat status,
focusing on green corridors
and wildlife networks to link
up existing sites. And we will
commit to increasing the

area covered by forest and
woodland.

Our air, rivers and beaches are
now the cleanest they have been
since the height of the industrial
revolution. We will continue

to ensure progress. Having
doubled spending on flood
defence over the last decade we
will bring forward legislation

to improve floods and water
management.

We have banned foxhunting
and animal testing for cosmetics
and tobacco, and we will bring
forward further animal welfare

measures. We will campaign
internationally to end illegal
trading in ivory and to protect
species such as polar bears, seals
and bluefin tuna, as well as for an
EU-wide ban on illegally logged
timber, banning it domestically if
this does not succeed.

Sustainable farming,
healthy food

We want British farming to be
profitable and competitive. We
need our farmers to produce
more food, nurturing our
countryside and biodiversity.
We will continue to seek reform
of the Common Agriculture
Policy (CAP) to facilitate the
creation of fairer and better-
functioning agricultural
markets, enabling farmers to
return a reasonable profit from
food production at lower cost to
the consumer.

In order to protect farmers

and food suppliers from unfair
and uncompetitive practices by
major retailers, we will create

a Supermarket Ombudsman.
Consumers have the right to
know where food comes from.
We are working with the food
industry and retailers to ensure
proper food labelling, including
tougher and clearer ‘country of
origin’ information. This will
also help to level the playing
field for British farmers.

8:5

An economically viable and
environmentally sustainable
fishing industry is vital for our
coastal communities. We will
push for fundamental reform
of the EU Common Fisheries
Policy.

Thriving rural communities

Those who live in rural

areas are entitled to excellent
amenities and services, as are
those who live in towns and
cities. Rural communities

face unique challenges. We
are committed to continued
investment in frontline services
in rural areas.

Already £3.9 billion is being
spent on support for the rural
economy and we will continue
to provide specific support

to rural businesses. We are
building 10,000 homes in

rural areas up to 2011. We are
protecting rural bus services
and making it more difficult for
rural schools to be closed.

Rural businesses and
communities must have the
broadband connections they
need. We are committed to
universal broadband access,
irrespective of location. The
levy on fixed phone lines will
pay for expansion of fast
broadband connections to rural
areas.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Green recovery

 

Rural villages should never be
eft without essential services.
Councils now have to ensure
hat the importance of local
services to the community

is taken into account before
granting planning permission

o change their use, and we will
strengthen this to protect viable
shops, pubs and community
facilities. We will continue

0 encourage and support
imaginative solutions in rural
communities to the provision of
ocally owned services.

The challenge for Britain

To forge a new constitutional and political settlement

in Britain so that we restore trust in politics, and our
political institutions are properly held to account by

the people. The Tories oppose any real reform of the
political system that has let the public down. Their
policies would result in a postcode lottery based on
‘free-for-all’ localism rather than genuine empowerment
and a future fair for all.

The next stage of national renewal

¢ Referenda, held on the same day, for moving to the
Alternative Vote for elections to the House of Commons
and to a democratic and accountable Second Chamber.

¢ Improved citizenship education for young people
followed by a free vote in Parliament on reducing the
voting age to 16.

¢ Legislation to ensure Parliaments sit for a fixed term
and an All Party Commission to chart a course to a
Written Constitution.

¢ Astatutory register of lobbyists, with MPs banned
from working for lobbying companies and required to
seek approval for paid outside appointments.

¢ Stronger local government, with increased local
democratic scrutiny over all local public services.

We face a deep crisis of Cleaning up politics
trust in politics following the
parliamentary expenses scandal.
Faith in our political institutions
was seriously eroded by the
abuses of the expenses system.
Only radical change can begin
to renew our democracy.

We acted swiftly to clean

up politics by creating an
Independent Parliamentary
Standards Authority (IPSA) to
set pay and pensions for MPs,
as well as their allowances. And
we will take further measures
to restore trust in our politics.

9:2

MPs who are found responsible
for financial misconduct will

be subject to a right of recall if
Parliament itself has failed to
act against them. The House
of Lords and the new Second
Chamber will be brought
under the aegis of IPSA.

Je will create a Statutory
Register of Lobbyists to ensure
complete transparency in their
activities. We will ban MPs from
working for generic lobbying
companies and require those
who want to take up paid
outside appointments to seek
approval from an independent
body to avoid jobs that conflict
with their responsibilities to the
public.

But this is only the start.

People want a greater say in
how the country is governed
and for politicians to be more
accountable to those they serve.
So while we are proud of our
record of devolving power and
reforming the constitution, we
believe that further and more
radical reform is imperative if
we are to renew our democratic
public life. Britain needs a new
constitutional and political
settlement for a new era.

A new politics

To begin the task of building
a new politics, we will let

the British people decide on

whether to make Parliament

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Democratic reform

 

more democratic and
accountable in referenda

on reform of the House of
Commons and House of Lords,
to be held on the same day, by
October 2011.

To ensure that every MP is
supported by the majority of
their constituents voting at
each election, we will hold a
referendum on introducing the
Alternative Vote for elections to
the House of Commons.

We will ensure that the
hereditary principle is removed
from the House of Lords.
Further democratic reform to
create a fully elected Second
Chamber will then be achieved
in stages. At the end of the next
Parliament one third of the
House of Lords will be elected;
a further one third of members
will be elected at the general
election after that. Until the
final stage, the representation of
all groups should be maintained
in equal proportions to now.
We will consult widely on these
proposals, and on an open-list
proportional representation
electoral system for the Second
Chamber, before putting them
to the people in a referendum.

To further strengthen our
democracy and renew our
constitution, we will legislate for
Fixed Term Parliaments and
set up an All Party Commission

 

to chart a course to a Written
Constitution. We are proud to
have brought in the Human
Rights Act, enabling British
citizens to take action in British
courts rather than having to
wait years to seek redress in
Strasbourg. We will not repeal
or resile from it.

Our society rightly demands
respect from young people. At
the same time, society should
respect young people’s views
and aspirations. The success
of elections for local Youth
Mayors and the UK Youth
Parliament strengthens the
case for reducing the voting
age to 16, a change to which
Labour is committed. However,
we believe that prior to this
happening, we need further to
improve citizenship education
in schools so that young people
are better prepared for their
democratic responsibilities; a
report will be commissioned
on how best to achieve this so
that we can raise standards

in citizenship education,
before providing a free vote

in Parliament on reducing the
voting age to 16, for which we
will make government time
available.

9:3

Stronger accountability

A new politics also means
strengthening the power of
Parliament to hold the executive
to account. We have supported
changes to how Parliament
functions in order to strengthen
Select Committees and to give a
stronger voice to backbenchers.
The public will be given a new
right to petition the House of
Commons to trigger debates

on issues of significant public
concern. Parliament must better
reflect the diversity of modern
Britain. Labour already has a
higher proportion of female
and black and ethnic minority
MPs than any other party. We
will take forward the proposals
of the recent Speaker's
Conference so that the House
of Commons properly reflects
he diversity of modern Britain.

We strongly support measures
hat improve the transparency
of parliamentary institutions
and government, and want

o see this principle extended
hroughout public life. To
encourage freedom of speech
and access to information,

we will bring forward new
egislation on libel to protect
he right of defendants to speak
reely.

The cost of politics to the
axpayer must be minimised,
but we reject using this as

 

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Democratic reform

 

an excuse to gerrymander
constituency boundaries in the
interests of one political party.
We will establish a non-partisan
Parliamentary Boundaries
Review to examine the rules
for constructing parliamentary
constituencies. We have

already legislated to enable the
individual registration of voters.
We will now act, legislating
further if necessary, to end the
unacceptable situation where
three million eligible voters
cannot vote because they are
not registered to do so.

We believe that the funding

of political parties must be
reformed if the public is to
regain trust in politics. Our
starting point should be the
Hayden Phillips proposals

of 2008. We will seek to
reopen discussions on party-
funding reform, with a clear
understanding that any changes
should only be made on the
basis of cross-party agreement
and widespread public support.

Devolving power

The new politics also means
radical change to local public
services. Our goal is for much
greater local flexibility and
responsiveness, so that services
are shaped around the personal
needs of citizens, not the silos
of government departments.
Greater accountability —

with public services built
around users, scrutinised

by democratically elected
local councils, and with clear
rights of redress for citizens
— will strengthen support for
collectively provided services,
while driving efficiency and
effectiveness in expenditure.

Local government and its
partners in public services
are already pooling budgets
across localities. Our radical
Total Place agenda will take
this further, giving local areas
additional freedom to achieve
better services and more
savings, cutting bureaucracy
and management costs, while
placing a greater on early
intervention. Ring-fenced
budgets, central targets and
indicators will be cut back.

Local government is at the
forefront of tackling the major
challenges our society faces,
from climate change to ageing.
Increasingly, councils are the
motors of economic growth
and regeneration, particularly
in our great cities. We will

give local government new
powers to lead in the provision
and financing of social and
affordable housing, tackle
climate change and work with
the NHS in our new National
Care Service.

9:4

These reforms provide the
foundations for fundamental
change. In contrast to ‘no frills’
councils that charge twice for all
but the most basic services, we
believe that local government
must further empower residents
to hold it to account and deliver
better, more personalised
services. Alongside enhanced
scrutiny powers for councillors,
we are introducing petitioning
powers for local residents to
demand action, and extending
neighbourhood agreements
where citizens set out the
standards of services they
expect locally.

We will also extend the powers
available to our major city-
regions, building upon the
pioneering arrangements in
Greater Manchester, Leeds
and Birmingham. City-

regions will be able to gain
additional powers to improve
transport, skills and economic
development and acquire
greater borrowing flexibility.
Where new city-region
authorities are created, we will
give residents the opportunity to
trigger a referendum for directly
electing a Mayor, with London-
style powers. More towns
should be encouraged to apply
for city status and have the
chance to acquire it in future
competitions.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Democratic reform

 

Our towns and cities need
modern, sustainable transport
infrastructure. We will support
tram schemes into the major
cities, including upgrades to
the Manchester, Nottingham,
Birmingham and Tyne & Wear
light-rail systems, a modern
trolley bus in Leeds, and more
Oyster-style electronic ticketing
promoting cheap and easy
interchange between public
transport in cities.

We recognise that buses are

a lifeline, having doubled
investment since 1997. We will
provide punctuality data on all
bus routes so passengers can
hold services to account. We
want greater use of London-
style powers to regulate bus
routes where local bus services
are not serving communities
well, and we will work with the
Competition Commission to
ensure that the bus companies
do not make excess profits at
the expense of passengers.

We have increased funding
for local government by 45
per cent in real terms since
1997. Through tough capping
powers and efficiencies, this
year we have seen the lowest
Council Tax rises on record
and we expect them to stay
low. Excessive rises will be
capped. We will not hold a
Council Tax revaluation in
the next Parliament and we

will establish a cross-party
commission to review the future
of local government finance to
ensure it is meeting our goals
of accountability, equity and
efficiency across the country.

Public services in the
digital age

Citizens expect their public
services to be transparent,
interactive and easily accessible.
We will open up government,
embedding access to
information and data into the
very fabric of public services.
Citizens should be able to
compare local services, demand
improvements, choose between
providers, and hold government
to account.

We have led the world with
the creation of data.gov.uk,
putting over 3,000 government
datasets online. Entrepreneurs
and developers have used
these datasets to unleash
social innovation, creating
applications and websites for
citizens from local crime maps
to new guides to help find
good care homes or GPs. We
will now publish a Domesday
Book of all non-personal
datasets held by government
and its agencies, with a default
assumption that these will

be made public. We will
explore how to give citizens
direct access to the data held

9:5

on them by public agencies,

so that people can use and
control their own personal
data in their interaction with
service providers and the wider
community.

Opening up government —
central and local — in this way
offers huge potential for Britain.
We can use new technologies

to give people a say on policy-
making; enable citizens to carry
out more of their dealings with
government online; and save
money for taxpayers as we
switch services over to digital-
only delivery.

Digital government also
demands digital inclusion. So
we will build on our network

of UK Online centres and
public libraries to spread free
internet access points within the
community, and develop new
incentives for users to switch to
online services.

Protecting the UK and
supporting the Union

Devolution has strengthened
the UK, preserving the

union on the basis of a fairer
partnership. The UK is strong
enough and flexible enough to
devolve power while retaining
the benefits of staying together.

The Scottish Parliament and
the Welsh Assembly have put

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
Democratic reform

 

more power in the hands of
local people. All the evidence
is that devolution works, and
is popular. We will implement
the recommendations of

the Calman Commission,
including giving the Scottish
Parliament additional tax-
raising powers, and seek ways
to build consensus behind these
changes.

In Wales, we will work with the
Welsh Assembly Government
on a referendum to enhance
the powers to make laws
affecting Wales in Wales;

and to ensure that Wales

is not disproportionately
disadvantaged by the
application of the central
government funding formula.

For the first time, Northern
Treland can look forward to a
stable and prosperous future
as a result of the Good Friday,
St Andrews and Hillsborough
Agreements. Supported by
unprecedented public funding,
we will continue to invest in
the institutions of devolution,
so that the Unionist and
Republican traditions can work
together for all the people of
Northern Ireland.

Our constitutional monarchy
is the source of deep pride and
strength for our country. We
believe that there is a case for
reform of the laws concerning

marriage to Roman Catholics
and the primacy of male
members of the Royal family.
However, any reform would
need the agreement of all the
Commonwealth countries

of which the Queen is the
Sovereign.

The challenge for Britain

To harness our strengths and values, as we develop
Britain's world role in a global era, using our alliances
and networks in order to promote security, economic
prosperity, development and to safeguard the
environment. The contrast with the Tory view could not
be starker: they are stuck in the past, spurning alliances
in Europe and helpless to defend our interests or secure
the global change we need.

The next stage of national renewal

¢ Conduct a Strategic Defence Review to equip our Armed
Forces for 21st Century challenges, and support our
troops and veterans.

¢ Use our international reach to build security and
stability — combating terrorism and extremism, curbing
proliferation, preventing and resolving conflict, and
tackling climate change.

¢ Lead the agenda for an outward-facing European Union
that delivers jobs, prosperity and global influence.

¢ Re-energise the drive to achieve the Millennium
Development Goals, supporting sustainable growth and
combating poverty.

¢ Reform the UN, International Financial Institutions,
the G8 and G20, and NATO to adapt to the new global
challenges.

stable Pakistan means a safer
Britain: if Afghanistan fell to
the Taleban, Al Qaeda could
regroup, and Pakistan’s stability
and our national security would
be threatened.

Afghanistan: our
commitment

There is no greater
responsibility than to commit
our troops into action. That is
why we take our responsibilities
in Afghanistan and to our
Armed Forces so seriously.

A stable Afghanistan and a

Our Armed Forces are serving
with incredible courage and
skill alongside representatives

10:2

of more than 40 other nations.
They are a credit to the

country and an example to

the world. We have met every
request for extra equipment

for Afghanistan: in the last

four years we have doubled the
number of helicopters, and
spent £1.7 billion on 1,800 new
vehicles — including the Mastiff,
brought into service in record
time and saving lives with
world-leading protection against
mines and roadside bombs.

Our forces are working to

a clear strategy — to protect

the Afghan people and train
Afghan security forces. The
London conference in January
2010 agreed there should be
300,000 Afghan Army and
Police by the end of 2011,
with British forces and other
countries shifting more of their
effort into training to begin

the process of handing over
responsibility for districts and
provinces to Afghan forces later
this year.

Afghanistan is not a war
without end. Together the
military and civilian effort

is designed to create the
conditions for a political
settlement that keeps Al Qaeda
out, reconciles tribal interests,
and involves Afghanistan’s
neighbours. It will lock in the
long-term gains delivered by
our aid programme since 2002

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
A global future

 

— with millions more children,
especially girls, going to school,
big reductions in child mortality,
and better access to basic
healthcare. It requires stronger
local administration and less
corruption, combined with a
way back for former fighters
who are prepared to renounce
links to Al Qaeda and abide by
the Afghan constitution.

Strengthening our Armed
Forces and national
security

The first duty of government
is to protect the security of

its citizens. We have created
Britain’s first ever National
Security Strategy to strengthen
our response to fast-moving
and interconnected threats,
from terrorism and nuclear
proliferation to new challenges
like cybersecurity. We have
trebled investment in counter-
terrorism at home, combined
with multilateral action against
terrorism and extremism
abroad, not just in the Afghan-
Pakistan border areas ~ still the
main source of the threat — but
also in Yemen and Somalia.

Our commitment to defence

is non-negotiable. Defence
spending has increased by ten
per cent in real terms since
1997. Funding for Iraq and
Afghanistan is additional to
that, with the Treasury Reserve

providing £18 billion in total so
far and an estimated £5 billion
in the next year.

Despite this continued
investment, acute cost pressures
remain in long-term defence
projects. We are reforming
defence procurement, making
further reductions in civilian
staff, and cutting lower-priority
spending on headquarters costs,
travel and consultancy.

A Strategic Defence Review
will look at all areas of defence,
but we will maintain our
independent nuclear deterrent.
We will fight for multilateral
disarmament, working for a
world free of nuclear weapons,
in the Non Proliferation Treaty
Review conference and beyond
— combining support for civilian
nuclear energy with concerted
action against proliferation.

We are committed to a strong
Navy based on the new aircraft
carriers, an Air Force with two
state-of-the-art fast-jet fleets as
well as additional helicopters,
transport planes and unmanned
drones, and a strong, high-tech
Army, vastly better equipped
than it was in 1997.

The growth in the core defence
budget has also enabled us

to guarantee fair pay for all

our forces, including the first
ever tax-free bonus for those

10:3

on operations abroad, while
strengthening our support for
their welfare. Service families
can now retain their place on
NHS waiting lists when they are
deployed to another part of the
country. Further education is
free for those leaving the forces
with six years’ service or more.

We have invested hundreds of
millions of pounds to reverse

a legacy of decades of neglect
of forces’ accommodation,
and we are helping service
personnel get onto the housing
ladder. Homelessness among
service leavers has been sharply
reduced, and the law changed
to give them better access to
social housing.

The new Queen Elizabeth
Hospital in Birmingham will
have a military-run ward

and the largest single-floor
critical care unit in the world.
Headley Court and the new
Army Recovery Capability will
continue to offer world-leading
support to those rehabilitating
after serious injury. We

have doubled the lump-sum
payments for the most seriously
injured to £570,000, and
increased the lifetime-income
payments by up to a third.

As a sign of our continued
commitment to the military
community, we will introduce
a Forces Charter to enshrine

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
A global future

 

in law the rights of forces,

their families, and Veterans.

A Veterans ID card will help
Veterans access their improved
benefits and will be free to
service leavers. We will continue
to strengthen mental health
provision in partnership with
the Combat Stress charity, and
roll out our Welfare Pathway to
give personnel and their families
better support and advice.

A strong Britain ina
reformed Europe

We are proud that Britain is
once again a leading player

in Europe. Our belief is that
Britain is stronger in the world
when the European Union is
strong, and that Britain succeeds
when it leads in Europe and sets
the agenda for change. Sullen
resistance and disengagement
achieve nothing.

Stronger competitiveness

must be Europe’s economic
priority. Europe will only

grow and prosper if it is
dynamic and knowledge-based,
with excellent universities,
competitive companies, and
thriving start-ups, underpinned
by a modern infrastructure of
digital communications and
low-carbon transport. The

EU should strive to improve
the regulatory environment, in
particular for small and medium
sized business. But we reject

any attempt to renegotiate or
unravel social rights for the
British people, and believe that
economic strength and social
protection go hand-in-hand —

a modern EU must enhance
competitiveness and growth
while guaranteeing security and
fair rights at work.

Fundamental reform of the
EU budget remains necessary,
with further changes to the
Common Agricultural Policy
on the way to ending export
subsidies. Transfers within the
EU must target those areas that
are least well off. On the Euro,
we hold to our promise that
there will be no membership of
the single currency without the
consent of the British people in
a referendum.

We support the enlargement

of EU membership to include
Croatia, and believe that

all Western Balkan states

should open negotiations on
EU accession by 2014 — one
hundred years after the start of
the First World War. Turkey’s
future membership is a key test
of Europe’s potential to become
a bridge between religions and
regions; there must be continued
progress on its application to
join the EU. In its foreign policy,
Europe should play a key role
in conflict resolution and the
promotion of security, and work
bilaterally to achieve its goals

10:4

with the leading global powers
in each region of the world.

On climate change, the EU has
a critical leadership role to play
in securing a legally binding
UN agreement, reducing its
emissions by 30 per cent on
1990 levels in the context of an
ambitious global deal. It must
also offer stronger leadership on
global poverty reduction.

We will strengthen co-operation
with our EU partners in
fighting crime and international
terrorism, and support practical
European co-operation on
defence, in partnership with
NATO. To symbolise its
commitment to global peace
and justice, and energise its
young people, we propose a
European Peace Corps.

The poverty of the Tory vision
is summed up by their false
choice between an alliance
with the United States and
one with Europe. In Europe
they are not just isolated,

but marginalised — in a tiny
group of far-right parties that
endorses extreme views and is
stuck in climate-change denial.
Elsewhere in the world their
anti-European attitudes are
seen as undermining British
influence. They are helpless to
shape change, or defend our
interests.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
A global future

 

Strengthening global
security and preventing
conflict

We strongly believe in co-
operation between nations

for a safer world. We will
continue to press for stronger
international action against
terrorism and learn the lessons
of recent experience to prevent
and defuse conflict and build
stability and the rule of law in
places that would otherwise
shelter terrorist networks. We
have shown in Afghanistan and
elsewhere that our military,
diplomats and development
staff can set an international
standard for joint working, but
we will not put the aid budget
under military control. We
will spend at least half of our
new bilateral aid in fragile and
conflict-affected states.

Having played a leading role
in the international agreement
to ban cluster bombs, we are
leading the campaign for a
legally binding global arms
trade treaty in 2012.

We will continue to drive reform
of the humanitarian agencies

at the UN and work to build

an international consensus on
‘responsibility to protect’, while
supporting the International
Criminal Court in bringing
previously untouchable
criminals to justice. We will

advocate a new international
convention to enable the
prosecution of perpetrators of
genocide and crimes against
humanity.

There is no more important
part of the world for global
security than the Middle East.
We support the creation of a
viable Palestinian state that can
live alongside a secure Israel.
All the countries of the region
have a role to play in delivering
the vision of the Arab Peace
Initiative — normalised relations
between Arab states and Israel
in return for a Palestinian state.
They also have a shared interest
in preventing the acquisition

of nuclear weapons by Iran.
This is the gravest nuclear
threat to global security since
the foundation of the Non-
Proliferation Treaty in the
1960s. We support engagement
and pressure on the Iranian
regime; it is threatening its own
people as well as the security of
the region and the world.

In Africa, Labour has made
aid, trade, conflict prevention
and good governance a priority.
We will support the final

stages of the Comprehensive
Peace Agreement in Sudan,
and maintain the pressure for
Zimbabwe to transition back

to democracy as quickly as
possible.

10:5

We will work with Greece and
Turkey for long-term stability in
Cyprus; and continue to support
bilateral efforts by India and
Pakistan to improve relations.
The two countries have
profound ties to the UK, which
we are determined to nurture.
We will keep up the pressure for
the release of Aung Sang Suu
Kyi and a return to democracy
in Burma.

We strongly support
reconstruction and
reconciliation in Sri Lanka. We
believe that both the LTTE
and the Government of Sri
Lanka must be held to account
for the loss of civilian life, and
we will continue to urge the Sri
Lankan Government to fulfil its
commitment to a full and fair
investigation into war crimes
committed in the final months
of the civil war.

Human rights and democracy
are a central feature of our
foreign policy for a simple
reason — we believe human
rights are universal, and it is
the job of strong and mature
democracies to support the
development of free societies
everywhere — while upholding
our own legal and moral
obligations.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
A global future

 

The global poverty
emergency: our moral
duty, our common interest

Labour’s international
leadership on development

has helped transform the lives
of millions across the world.
Yet too many people still live

in extreme poverty, die from
treatable diseases, or are denied
the chance to go to school.

We will lead an international
campaign to get the Millennium
Development Goals back on
track. We remain committed

to spending 0.7 per cent of
national income on aid from
2013, and we will enshrine this
commitment in law early in the
next Parliament. Our aid will
target the poorest and most
excluded — spent transparently
and evaluated independently.
We will fight corruption,
investing more to track, freeze,
and recover assets stolen

from developing countries.
Further action will be taken to
strengthen developing countries’
tax systems, reduce tax evasion,
improve reporting, and crack
down on tax havens. To increase
accountability, we will allocate at
least five per cent of all funding
developing country budgets for
the purpose of strengthening
the role of Parliaments and civil
society.

Our leadership on debt
cancellation has freed 28
countries from the shackles
of debt. We will continue to
drive this agenda, building on
legislation to clampdown on
vulture funds.

Access to health, education,
food, water and sanitation are
basic human rights. We will
spend £8.5 billion over eight
years to help more children go
to school; maintain our pledge
to spend £6 billion on health
between 2008 and 2015 and £1
billion through the Global Fund
to support the fight against
HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria;
fight for universal access to
prevention, treatment and

care for HIV/AIDS by 2010;
and deliver at least 30 million
additional anti-malarial bed-
nets over the next three years.

We will provide £1 billion

for water and sanitation by
2013, driving this issue up the
international agenda, and over
£1 billion on food security and
agriculture. We will push for
the establishment of a Global
Council on Child Hunger. We
will help save the lives of six
million mothers and babies by
2015 and, because international
focus on the needs of women
and girls is vital, we will double
core funding to the new UN
Women’s agency. While the
Tories would favour private

10:6

schemes, we will work closely
with NGOs and developing
countries to eliminate user fees
and promote healthcare and
education free at the point

of access. We will encourage
other countries to ratify the
ILO conventions on labour
standards, as we have done.

Trade can lift millions out of
poverty. We will work with the
private sector, trade unions

and co-operatives to promote
sustainable development,
quadruple our funding for fair
and ethical trade, and press for
a fair World Trade Organisation
deal, with no enforced
liberalisation for poor countries,
and increased duty-free and
quota-free access.

Reforming global
institutions

In today’s world, power is
shifting, flowing downwards and
outwards towards new non-state
actors, networked by modern
communications. Governments
and global institutions must
respond to this change — and
reform to meet new challenges.
They need to be more effective
but also more inclusive. To
secure global change, we will
make the case for:

¢ The extension of the G8.

e Aclearer mandate for the
World Bank to focus on the

The Labour Party Manifesto 2010
A global future

 

poorest countries and promote
low-carbon development;

and for the IMF to focus on
financial stability, with both
becoming more inclusive.

e Radical UN reform, including
new membership of the
Security Council, budgetary
reform, and an overhaul of
UN agencies.

¢ Continuing reform of NATO
and stronger international
co-operation to tackle security
challenges, while building the
capacity of regional security
organisations including the
African Union.

¢ The enduring role of the
Commonwealth — a unique
organisation for fostering
understanding and trust,
spanning a quarter of the
world’s population.

International commitments
and a voice for Britain in global
affairs are not an optional extra
for Labour. They are central to
our vision of a better Britain.
We have strengthened our
international alliances and will
continue to do so in ways that
speak to our deepest values as a
nation.

Secure the recovery by supporting the economy now, and more
than halve the deficit by 2014 through economic growth, fair taxes
and cuts to lower priority spending.

Realise our stakes in publicly controlled banks to secure the best
deal for the tax-payer, introduce a new global levy, and reform the
rules for banking to ensure no repeat of past irresponsibility.

broadband access for all.

Encourage a culture of long-term commitment to sustainable
company growth, requiring a super-majority of two-thirds of
shareholders in corporate takeovers.

200,000 jobs through the Future Jobs Fund, with a job or training
place for young people who are out of work for six months, but
benefits cut at ten months if they refuse a place; and anyone
unemployed for more than two years guaranteed work, but no
option of life on benefits.

A National Minimum Wage rising at least in line with average
earnings, and a new £40-a-week Better Off in Work guarantee.

More advanced apprenticeships and Skills Accounts for workers to
upgrade their skills.

Guarantee fast and effective action to deal with anti-social
behaviour, including a right to legal injunctions for repeat victims,
funded by the police or council who let them down.

Expand tough ‘Community Payback’ for criminals who don’t go to
prison, giving everyone the right to vote on the work they do.

Control immigration through our Australian-style points-based
system, ensuring that as growth returns we see rising levels of

newcomers to earn citizenship and the entitlements it brings.

More help for parents to balance work and family life, with a
‘Father’s Month’ of flexible paid leave.

A new Toddler Tax Credit of £4 a week from 2012 to give more
support to all parents of young children — whether they want to

The right to request flexible working for older workers, with an
end to default retirement at 65, enabling more people to decide for
themselves how long they choose to keep working.

for those with the greatest care needs and a cap on the costs
of residential care so that everyone’s homes and savings are
protected from care charges after two years in a care home.

Make greener living easier and fairer through ‘pay as you save’
home energy insulation, energy-bill discounts for pensioners and
requiring landlords to properly insulate rented homes.

Move towards a ‘zero waste’ Britain, banning recyclable and
biodegradable materials from landfill.

The Labour Party
Manifesto 2015

Labour’s Manifesto Budget Responsibility Lock

Our manifesto begins with the Budget Responsibility Lock we offer the British
people. It is the basis for all our plans in this manifesto because it is by securing
our national finances that we are able to secure the family finances of the
working people of Britain.

The Budget Responsibility Lock guarantees that:

Every policy in this manifesto is paid for. Not one commitment requires
additional borrowing. We are the first party to make that pledge and with
this manifesto it is delivered. We will legislate to require all major parties to
have their manifesto commitments independently audited by the Office for
Budget Responsibility.

A Labour government will cut the deficit every year. The first line of Labour's
first Budget will be: “This Budget cuts the deficit every year”. This manifesto
sets out that we will only lay a Budget before the House of Commons that
cuts the deficit every year, which the OBR will independently verify.

We will get national debt falling and a surplus on the current budget as soon
as possible in the next parliament. This manifesto sets out that we will not
compromise on this commitment.

We are a great country. With great people. In the last five years | have heard your
stories, your hopes and your dreams. And | have heard too your frustrations.

The countless people working as hard as they possibly can and still struggling to
pay the bills. The young people with great ambitions but great anxieties about
the future. The dedicated staff of our NHS, who are deeply concerned about
its future. And all those who have served our country, are now retired, and ask
where our country is going.

This manifesto is inspired by you.
| take a simple view. We are a great country, but we can be even better

The fundamental truth that runs through this manifesto is that Britain will only
succeed when working people succeed. It is an idea at the heart of my beliefs.
And it drives our better plan for a better future.

t means a country where hard work is rewarded, with high skill, high wage jobs.
An economy built on strong and secure foundations, where we balance the books.

it means building a future for all our young people, so they can get world-class
apprenticeships and access to affordable, higher education. It means strong
public services, rescuing our NHS.

It means strong communities, where power is shared by people in every part of
he country and where we respond to people's concerns about immigration, with
proper controls.

it means a Britain where everyone plays by the same rules, including those at the
very top of our society. And it means an outward looking country, engaged in the
world for our national interest.

 

For me, the privilege of serving as Prime Minister in our country would be for one
purpose alone: to work every day to help build a country that works again for
working people. This manifesto is our plan to achieve that goal.

B ritain is a great country ready to build a better future.

This manifesto sets out Labour's plan for national renewal.

The British people, are known for tolerance, responsibility to others and for
our belief in the value of hard work. We look confidently outward to the world.
These are great British traditions - things we all believe in, things our country is
good at. We are at our best when we work together. We see this every day in
our workplaces, in our families, and in our communities. People want to get on,
they want to give their children a better future, and they want to help to change
Britain for the better.

But across Britain working people also know a simple truth: the economy is not
working for them. For years now, our economy has not rewarded everyone who
put in a good, honest day's work. However hard people work, many don't earn
enough to make ends meet. Too many have been driven from secure, full-time
work, into precarious, badly paid jobs - many working on zero-hours contracts.
Time to enjoy friends and family is increasingly squeezed, as mothers and fathers
juggle the demands of work and caring for children, and often an older relative.

The problems mount for the next generation too. Young people are taking on
a mountain of debt to go to university and too many still cannot find a job
worthy of their talents. We lack a proper system of vocational education and
apprenticeships to give our young people the start in life that they deserve.
We are not building the homes we need. Our sons and daughters have been
shut out of the housing market and too often they are forced to leave the
communities where they were brought up.

Our economy and our system of government are failing people. Many have
come to believe that politics ignores the things that matter to them. Too much
power is unaccountable, concentrated in the market and the state, at the
expense of individuals and their communities.

Many of these problems have been mounting for years. Some, like the rise of
inequality, are felt in countries all around the world. So the Conservatives did
not cause all of them, but they have made them far worse. Their view is that
economic success depends just on a few at the top. They think that insecurity

A BETTER FUTURE FOR BRITAIN

will make people work harder and that low pay is the only way to be competitive
in the global market. They don't believe we can afford decent public services
when times are hard. They have been giving power to large unaccountable
irms rather than to people, and now they want to make deeper cuts in the next
hree years than we have seen in the last five years.

There are some who believe there is nothing we can do to change things for
he better. They feel powerless. They are losing faith that those with power
will ever listen to them. We understand these feelings. But we believe we can
renew our country and make a better future for working people. We have
earned the lessons of the past. We were in government for thirteen years and
eft the country a far better place to live in. But we did not get everything right.
We have learned and we have changed.

Labour is renewing our traditions as the Party of work, family and community.
We believe in a society of trust and mutual obligation, in which we look after
he vulnerable, and people can bring up their families with hope for a better
uture. And we believe in helping people to help themselves, both to improve

 

heir own communities, and to achieve their ambitions.

We are also the Party of equality. We believe that no person should suffer
discrimination or a lack of opportunity. The decisions we take in government
will always be taken with this in mind. The policies in our manifesto will help
remove the barriers that stand in the way of greater equality. We know we
achieve more when we work together to challenge inequalities of power and
build a common good.

In this election, the country has a choice. We can continue with a Conservative
plan based on the view that success comes only from a privileged few at the
top. Or we can change direction, begin to return power to people and build an
economy together in which everyone can contribute to a shared and enduring
prosperity.

We believe that Britain only succeeds when working families succeed. As the
economy at last recovers, people want the opportunity to use their skills and
talents to make a better life for themselves and their children. Our country's
greatest asset is the hard work and talent of our people.

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

Labour's plan is to build firmer economic foundations for creating wealth,
rewarding hard work and competing in the world.

We will balance the books by cutting the deficit every year, with a surplus on
the current budget and with national debt falling as soon as possible in the
next Parliament. This will need common sense spending reductions, outside
of the protected areas of health, education and international development.
We will ask those with incomes over £150,000 a year to contribute a little more
through a 50p rate of tax. And we will build the high-skill, high-wage economy
we need to raise tax revenues and control social security spending.

We will improve the security and reward of working life by raising the National
Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October 2019, banning exploitative
zero-hours contracts and promoting the Living Wage. We will create more
paths to success for our young people by introducing a gold-standard system
of technical education and training, and the guarantee of an apprenticeship for
every school leaver with the grades.

We will support families by expanding free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for
working parents of three and four-year-olds, while doubling paid paternity

 

leave for fathers. We will help with household bills freezing energy prices until
2017, while reforming the broken energy market. And we will make sure that at
least 200,000 new homes a year are built by 2020, and that private renters get
a fairer deal. The Bedroom Tax is cruel and we will abolish it.

We will build up our NHS so that it has time to care, funding 8,000 more GPs,
20,000 more nurses and 3,000 more midwives, paid for by a Mansion Tax
on properties worth over £2 million, a levy on tobacco firms, and by tackling
tax avoidance. And we will bring together services for physical health, mental
health and social care into a single system built around the individual.

We want a high quality education for all of our children. We will protect the
education budget and raise teaching standards, making sure there are smaller
class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds.

A BETTER FUTURE FOR BRITAIN

The common life we share is who we are as a country. Not everyone is the
same, but each of us sharing a sense of belonging, being valued equally and
being able to contribute to the common good. Immigration has made an
important contribution to our economic and social life, but it needs to be
properly controlled. With a Labour Government, migrants from the EU will not
be able to claim benefits until they have lived here for at least two years. We will
make it illegal to undercut wages by exploiting migrant workers, and work to
strengthen integration within our communities. Everyone who works with the
public in our public services must be able to speak English.

We will help to make communities safer, by protecting and strengthening
neighbourhood policing, countering extremism, and putting in place tough
new laws to reduce violence against women and child sexual exploitation.

People want more say in the decisions that affect their lives. We, in Labour,
know that Government has to do things differently. The old command and
control politics - doing things to and for people, but never with them - will not
work. We need a new approach to government that involves more people in
decisions that affect them. So we will devolve more power and control, not only
to Scotland and Wales, but to our great English cities and county regions too.
And we will share power and responsibility with people in their communities to
help them help themselves and shape their services in response to their local
circumstances.

Our country faces global challenges of climate change, terrorism and the spread
of disease. In particular, tackling climate change is an economic necessity and
the most important thing we must do for our children, our grandchildren and
future generations. A Labour government will face up to these challenges and
re-engage with the world. We will build alliances in Europe, promoting our
country’s interests and security, and standing up for human rights and social
justice. We will work to reform the European Union, and we will retain our
membership of it.

Labour's plan for national renewal will bring about real, meaningful change that
each person will be able to feel in their daily life. We know that to make Britain

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

12

a better country, opportunity must belong to everyone and not just a few. We
will lend a helping hand to all those who need it, but we will also ask more of
individuals and communities. We can only rebuild our country if everyone plays
their part and feels they have a stake in society.

We believe in living within our means. We will not make promises we cannot
keep, and we will not introduce changes unless they are funded. There is not
a single policy in this manifesto that is funded by additional borrowing. Not a
single one.

Our plan is to build a secure, prosperous and more equal country open to
the world, in which everyone has the opportunity to get on and do their best.
We will provide strong and effective government but everyone will need to
contribute and play their part. It will be hard, but working together we can do it.

‘e know a simple truth. Britain only succeeds when working families
Wie It is how our country has won through in the past and how
it will succeed in the future. But so many people are putting in the hours
and not seeing the rewards. That is why there is a cost of living crisis. Our
first task in government is to change our economy so that it works for all

of Britain’s businesses and working people.

The Conservatives claim that the economy is fixed and that our country is on
the right track. But the economy is not creating the productive, high-skilled
and well-paid jobs that we need to raise living standards. The lack of rewarding
work and training opportunities is trapping hundreds of thousands of young
people in a cycle of benefits and low-paid, insecure jobs. And consumers are
overcharged in markets they rely on to meet their everyday needs, whether to
heat their homes or travel to work.

For most of the 20th century, there was a vital link between the success of
the country and family finances. As the country got better off, so did working
people. But the link between the success of the country and the family budget
has been broken. Since 2010, working people are earning on average £1,600
less a year after inflation. We have seen the greatest fall in wages over a
parliament since 1874.

Over five million people are in low-paid jobs, earning less than the Living Wage.
There are 1.8 million zero-hours contracts. 1.3 million are working part-time
because they cannot get a full-time job. Half of all those in poverty live in
working households. 900,000 people, many of them in work, used food banks
last year.

This cost-of-living crisis is bad for families, bad for business, and bad for Britain.
Lower levels of pay have meant lower tax receipts and higher spending on
social security.

We will have to work and earn our way toward a more fairly shared and
enduring prosperity. We are a great commercial nation that has been at the
centre of global trade for centuries. We have a long tradition of innovation and
enterprise.

BUILDING AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR WORKING PEOPLE

We have been quick to seize the opportunities of the internet. We have big
strengths to build upon: world-leading universities, an outstanding science
research base, an open economy with one of the highest rates of foreign direct
investment in the world, and many successful global companies.

An inclusive wealth-creating economy works when there is a shared sense
of responsibility, so we will be a government that is both pro-business and
pro-worker. We value all our businesses as organisations of innovation and
wealth production, and we will work strategically with them to create wealth.
We value our trade unions as an essential force for a decent society and as
guarantors of skills and fair wages.

A Strong Economic Foundation

The next Labour Government will balance the books. We will only lay a Budget
before the House of Commons that cuts the deficit every year, which the Office
or Budget Responsibility will independently verify. We will get national debt
alling and a surplus on the current budget as soon as possible in the next
Parliament and these fiscal commitments will not be compromised. We will
ackle the root causes of the deficit by building a more productive economy
with living standards that rise year-on-year.

The Conservative-led Government promised to balance the books in this
Parliament. But this promise has been broken. The Conservatives will leave the
country borrowing over £75 billion this year.

Labour's plan to balance the books means making tough, but fairer choices. We
will reverse the Government's top-rate tax cut so that the highest one per cent
of earners, with an income of over £150,000, contribute a little more to help get

 

he deficit down. We will stop paying Winter Fuel Payments to the richest five
per cent of pensioners, and cap child benefit rises for two years. Outside of the
protected areas of health, education and international development there will
be cuts in spending. Ministerial pay will be cut and then frozen until we have
balanced the books. All proceeds from the sale of our stakes in Lloyds and RBS
will be used to repay the national debt.

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

17

18

We will live within our means. We have no proposals for any new spending paid
for by additional borrowing. All of our commitments will be paid for by reducing
spending elsewhere or by raising extra revenue. For example, we will introduce
a tax on properties worth over £2 million to help raise the £2.5 billion a year for
an NHS Time to Care Fund - part of our plan to save and improve the health
service. We will legislate to require all major parties to have their manifesto
commitments independently audited by the Office for Budget Responsibility at
each general election.

We will cap structural social security expenditure in each spending review
so that it is properly controlled. We will implement the proposals of Labour's
Zero-Based Review, which has already identified savings we will make through
reforming old government bureaucracies, devolving power and services to our
towns and cities, and redesigning public services, and which we will continue
in government. We will invest to prevent social problems rather than waste
money reacting to them. And we will use digital technology to create a more
responsive, devolved, and less costly system of government.

Fairer taxes

We will create a fairer tax system, helping those on middle and lower incomes
by introducing a lower 10p starting rate of tax, paid for by ending the
Conservatives’ Marriage Tax Allowance. We will not increase the basic or higher
rates of Income Tax or National Insurance. Nor will we raise VAT, and we renew
our pledge not to extend it to food, children’s clothes, books, newspapers or
public transport fares.

Our first Finance Bill will close the tax loopholes that cost the Exchequer billions
of pounds a year. We will introduce tougher penalties for those abusing the
tax system, end unfair tax breaks used by hedge funds and others, and bear
down on disguised employment. We will seek international agreement to make
country-by-country reporting information publicly available, and we will act
at home if agreement is not reached. British Overseas Territories and Crown
Dependencies will be required to produce publicly available registries of the
real owners of companies based there.

BUILDING AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR WORKING PEOPLE

We will carry out an immediate review into the culture and practices of HMRC
so that everyone follows the same rules and we increase the rigour of the tax
system. And we will abolish non-dom status so that all those who make the UK
their home pay tax in the same way as the rest of us.

It is by tackling tax avoidance in this concerted fashion that we can reduce the
deficit and protect the family budgets of working people.

Improving productivity and a new industrial
strategy

Labour will improve productivity by building a long-term investment culture
in the private and public sectors, and supporting small businesses in their
growth to becoming British success stories of the future. With Labour, Britain
will continue to have the most competitive rate of Corporation Tax in the G7.

Building world-class infrastructure will be crucial to fostering economic growth.
We will create certainty for investors by taking a long-term approach to the
major investment decisions facing the country. We will set up an independent
National Infrastructure Commission to assess how best to meet Britain's
infrastructure needs. It will make recommendations to government, monitor
their implementation, and hold government to account. These measures and
our long-term approach will help reinforce Britain's status as one of the world’s
greatest centres of science and engineering.

We will continue to support the construction of High Speed Two, but keep costs
down, and take action to improve and expand rail links across the North to
boost its regional economies. We will support long-term investment in strategic
roads, address the neglect of local roads, and promote cycling.

Following the Davies Review, we will make a swift decision on expanding airport
capacity in London and the South East, balancing the need for growth and the
environmental impact.

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

Scientific discovery and technological innovation will drive economic
advancement this century. We will introduce a new long-term funding policy
framework for science and innovation, providing the stability and continuity that
our companies and research institutes need to succeed.

We will work to make Britain a world leader in low carbon technologies over the
next decade, creating a million additional green jobs. This aim will be supported
by ambitious domestic carbon reduction targets, including a legal target to
remove the carbon from our electricity supply by 2030, and a major drive for
energy efficiency.

Our industrial strategy for the green economy will end the current uncertainty for
investors, with a timetable for the Green Investment Bank to be given additional
powers so that it can invest in green businesses and technology. We will create
an Energy Security Board to plan and deliver the energy mix we need, including
renewables, nuclear, green gas, carbon capture and storage, and clean coal.

For onshore unconventional oil and gas, we will establish a robust environmental
and regulatory regime before extraction can take place. And to safeguard the
uture of the offshore oil and gas industry, we will provide a long-term strategy
or the industry, including more certainty on tax rates and making the most of
he potential for carbon storage.

Labour's longer-term approach will drive innovation and build on our strengths
as a leader in digital technology. We are just at the start of the internet revolution.
Digital technology has transformed start-up costs making it easier to run your
own business. There is a widening in the application of new transformative
echnologies in the fields of robotics, genetics, 3D printing and Big Data. Our
economy is developing a network of connections that will revolutionise innovation.

 

Labour will ensure that all parts of the country benefit from affordable, high
speed broadband by the end of the Parliament. We will work with the industry
and the regulator to maximise private sector investment and deliver the mobile
infrastructure needed to extend coverage and reduce ‘not spots’, including in
areas of market failure. And we will support community-based campaigns to
reduce the proportion of citizens unable to use the internet and help those who
need it to get the skills to make the most of digital technology.

BUILDING AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR WORKING PEOPLE

Our universities are amongst the finest in the world. Some are already helping
our regional economies by forming strong links with industry and creating
high-tech clusters. They have already spun out hundreds of companies creating
thousands of jobs. We will support this model of knowledge clusters, especially
outside the South East.

Britain's economy is being held back by the culture of short-termism, which is a
major obstacle to the development of productive businesses and industries. We
will reform corporate governance to protect our leading firms from the pressure
to put tomorrow’s share price before long-term growth potential.

Institutional investors will have a duty to act in the best interests of ordinary
savers. They will have to prioritise long-term growth over short-term profits for
the companies in which they are investing. We will change takeover rules to
enhance the role of long-term investors by restricting voting to those already
holding shares when a bid is made. In addition, we will strengthen the public
interest test.

We will improve the link between executive pay and performance by simplifying
pay packages, and requiring investment and pension fund managers to disclose
how they vote on top pay. And we will make sure employees have a voice when
executive pay is set by requiring employee representation on remuneration
committees.

In this way we can start to create an economy based on mutual obligations,
encouraging employers and employees to build partnerships for improving both
business performance and job quality. Outdated practices, like blacklisting, have
no place in a modern economy.

Our charities, mutuals, co-operatives and social enterprises are pioneering new
models of production that enhance social value, promote financial inclusion,
and give individuals and communities power and control. We will continue
to support and help develop the social economy by improving access for
co-operative and mutual organisations to growth finance through the new British
Investment Bank. And we will consider how to support employee buy-outs when
businesses are being sold.

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

21

22

We will safeguard the public interest in the Royal Mail, supporting the creation
of a staff-led trust for the employee share, and keeping the remaining
30 per cent in public ownership. We will also support the universal service
obligation, ensuring competition does not undermine it and introducing
protections as necessary.

Backing small business

Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Their creativity and
dynamism are vital for raising productivity and competing in the global economy.
Labour will give them a voice at the heart of government - a Small Business
Administration, which will ensure procurement contracts are accessible and
regulations are designed with small firms in mind.

We will address rising costs for small businesses and strengthen rules on late
payment. Labour will put small businesses first in line for tax cuts. Instead of
cutting Corporation Tax again for the largest firms, we will cut, and then freeze
business rates for over 1.5 million smaller business properties.

We will develop a banking system that works for businesses in every region
and every sector in Britain. The long-standing problems of our banking system
mean that too many small and medium-sized businesses cannot get the
finance they need to invest and grow.

Labour will establish a British Investment Bank with the mission to help
businesses grow and to create wealth and jobs. It will have the resources to
improve access to finance for small and medium-sized businesses, and will
support a network of regional banks.

We will increase competition on the high street. Following the Competition
and Market Authorities inquiry we want a market share test and at least two
new challenger banks. And we will deal with the scourge of household debt
by introducing a new levy on payday lenders, using the funds raised to boost
low-cost alternatives like credit unions.

BUILDING AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR WORKING PEOPLE

Better work and better pay

Britain's route to prosperity and higher living standards is through more secure
and better paid jobs. But Conservative policies are causing whole sectors of
the economy to be dragged into a race to the bottom on wages and skills.
The Government has weakened employment rights and promoted a hire-and-
fire culture. Labour believes our economy can only succeed in a race to the
top - competing in the world with better work, better pay and better skills.

Too many people do a hard day's work but remain dependent on benefits. We
will raise the National Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October
2019, bringing it closer to average earnings. We will give local authorities a role
in strengthening enforcement against those paying less than the legal amount.
And we will support employers to pay more by using government procurement
to promote the Living Wage, alongside wider social impact considerations. Our
Make Work Pay contracts will give tax rebates to businesses who sign up to
paying the Living Wage in the first year of a Labour Government. Publicly listed
companies will be required to report on whether or not they pay the Living
Wage.

It is hard for Britain to succeed when employees feel insecure and employers
are undercut by those using exploitative working practices. Labour will ban
exploitative zero-hours contracts. Those who work regular hours for more than
12 weeks will have a right to a regular contract. We will abolish the loophole that
allows firms to undercut permanent staff by using agency workers on lower pay.

The Conservatives have introduced fees of up to £1,200 for employment tribunal
claimants, creating a significant barrier to workplace justice. We will abolish the
Government's employment tribunal fee system as part of wider reforms to make
sure that affordability is not a barrier to workers having proper access to justice,
employers get a quicker resolution, and the costs to the tax payer do not rise.

Labour is the Party of work, and we value working life. We will push up standards
and boost productivity by implementing the commitments in Labour's Workplace
and Business manifestos.

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

Supporting the next generation

Over 700,000 of our young people are unemployed. Too many of them do not
have the skills they need for work. And yet in the past year the number of young
people starting apprenticeships has fallen. The Government's decision to triple
university tuition fees leaves young people either starting their working lives
burdened by £44,000 of debt, or without a clear alternative path to a decent

career.

Labour will cut tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000 a year, funded by restricting
tax relief on pension contributions for the highest earners and clamping down
on tax avoidance.

We will tackle the growth of unpaid internships because thousands of highly
able young people who cannot afford to work for free are locked out of too
many of our professions.

We will introduce a Compulsory Jobs Guarantee, paid for by a bank bonus tax.
It will provide a paid starter job for every young person unemployed for over a
year, a job which they will have to take or lose benefits.

For too long we have failed to provide a system which makes the best use of
the talents of young people. So we will guarantee every school leaver that gets
the grades an apprenticeship. We will create thousands more apprenticeships
in the public sector, including the civil service. Every firm getting a major
government contract, and every large employer hiring skilled workers from
outside the EU, will be required to offer apprenticeships.

We will give employers more control over apprenticeships funding and
standards. In return, we will ask them to increase the number of high quality
apprenticeships in their sectors and supply chains. We will also give them the
powers to deal with any free-riding employers who do not train.

Labour's apprenticeships will be gold-standard qualifications. We will re-focus
existing spending away from low-level apprenticeships for older people, and
towards a system where apprenticeships are focused on new job entrants,
lasting at least two years, and providing level three qualifications or above.

BUILDING AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR WORKING PEOPLE

We will make sure that apprenticeships can lead to higher level qualifications
by creating new Technical Degrees and supporting part-time study. They will
be co-funded, co-designed and co-delivered by employers and they will be the
priority for expansion within our university system.

Young people who do not have the skills they need should be in training, not
on benefits. We will replace out of work benefits for 18 to 21-year-olds with a
new Youth Allowance dependent on recipients being in training and targeted
at those who need it most.

Mending the markets that people rely on

Labour will stand up for working families and businesses against vested
interests. We will reform the broken markets that people rely on most so that
families and businesses get a fair deal.

Energy bills have risen by over £300 since 2010. Many businesses say energy is
the biggest cost they face. Lack of competition and transparency has allowed
the large energy companies to get away with increasing bills when wholesale
prices rise, but not cutting them when they fall. The regulator has failed to take
decisive action to protect consumers.

Labour will freeze energy bills until 2017, ensuring that bills can fall but not
rise, and we will give the regulator the power to cut bills this winter. During
the freeze, we will reform the energy market so that it delivers fairer prices
and a better deal for working families. The generation and supply businesses
of the ‘Big Six’ energy companies will be separated. They will be required to
open up their books, and they will have to sell their electricity through an
open exchange. We will simplify energy tariffs and make it easier for people to
compare prices to get the best deal. We will protect small businesses by ending
unfair contracts and automatic rollovers to more expensive tariffs. A tough
new energy watchdog will enforce our reforms, with powers to strip energy
companies of their licences if they repeatedly harm the interests of consumers,
and protect off-grid households.

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015 25

26

We will bring down energy bills by making homes more energy efficient,
delivering a million interest free loans for energy home improvements in the
next Parliament. For those on low incomes, we will make 200,000 homes
warm every year, delivered street-by-street by local authorities and community
organisations. Privately rented properties will have to meet a decency standard,
bringing warmth to a further three million homes.

The water industry, too, also requires reform. One in five people struggle to
pay their water bill. Despite this, only a fraction of customers have benefited
rom the social tariffs offered by water companies. Under our reforms all water
companies will be required to sign up to a new national affordability scheme,
helping those who cannot afford to pay their water bill. And we will strengthen
he powers of the regulator to change licenses, limit price rises and enforce
industry standards.

Living standards have been hit by fare increases on public transport. Since
2010, rail fares have risen by 20 per cent, leaving passengers paying the highest
ares in Europe. Similarly, bus fares have risen by 27 per cent while at the same
ime 2,000 bus routes have been cut.

Labour will reform our transport system in order to provide more public control
and put the public interest first. We will review the franchising process as a
priority to put in place a new system and avoid a repeat of the Conservatives’

 

ranchising fiasco. A new National Rail body will oversee and plan for the
railways and give rail users a greater say in how trains operate. We will legislate
so that a public sector operator is allowed to take on lines and challenge the
private train operating companies on a level playing field.

Rail fares will be frozen next year to help commuters while we implement
reforms. A strict fare rise cap will be introduced on every route for any future
fare rises, and a new legal right for passengers will be created to access the
cheapest ticket for their journey.

City and county regions will be given more power over the way buses are
operated in their area. They will be able to decide routes, bear down on fares,
drive improvements in services, and bring together trains, buses and trams
into a single network with smart ticketing.

ur NHS, care services, schools, colleges and other public services
make up the essential fabric of our society. People need them to be
able to live secure and fulfilling lives. Britain needs them if we are to
succeed as a country. But under the Conservatives they are under threat.
The next Labour Government will protect, improve and invest in our public
services, while giving individuals and communities more control over

their design and delivery.

The NHS is one of our great national institutions, and it is one of Labour's
proudest achievements. It embodies our belief that by the strength of our
common endeavour, we achieve more than we achieve alone. But the future
of the NHS is under threat. The Conservatives have put the wrong values at its
heart, and patients are finding it harder to get the care they need.

Care is at the heart of Labour's values. No-one should fear old age or be left
to struggle alone caring for a loved one. But too many older people suffer
insecurity, loneliness and exclusion. And the growing social care crisis is one
of the biggest challenges we face. Since 2010, billions of pounds have been
cut from budgets that pay for adult social care. The result has been 300,000
fewer older people getting vital care services, at the same time as the number
of older people in need of care is increasing.

A good education is vital to achieving personal fulfillment and economic
prosperity. A good society depends upon an education system that can open
minds and teach the skills and knowledge we each need to get on in life. But
our education system is failing to meet the needs of young people who do not
follow the traditional academic path from school to university.

Our public services are a measure of the strength and decency of our society.
But we need a change in how we design them by pushing power down and
organising them around individuals and families not centralised bureaucracies.
Good public services also need committed staff who are treated fairly and
whose ethos of service is respected. They require decisions on pay that prioritise
those on lower incomes, which are evidence-based, and which respect Pay
Review Body recommendations rather than brushing them aside irresponsibly.

PROVIDING WORLD-CLASS HEALTH AND EDUCATION SERVICES

Government spends far too much money dealing with the symptoms of
problems, instead of investing smaller amounts in dealing with their causes.
Every taxpayer pays the cost of low educational achievement, poor aspirations,
drink and drug misuse, and criminality. So we will promote early-years
intervention, supporting young children and their parents and dealing with
problems before they get out of hand.

We can save money and create more responsive services by building
co-operation between public services and organisations. Pooling funds across
local areas reduces inefficiency and avoids duplication. Services must be joined
up in ways that make sense to the people who use them.

Labour will use digital technology in reforming our public services. People will
be able to feed back on services quickly and simply, making sure their voices
are heard, stimulating improvement and saving on the costs of service failure.

The NHS

Labour will rescue our NHS, invest in its future and join up services from home
to hospital.

We will start with the promise of investment so that the NHS has time to care.
The NHS is struggling with staffing shortages. Accident and emergency is in
crisis, and more people are facing long waits for tests, treatment, or to see a
GP. Labour will invest in 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs, and 3,000 more
midwives, paid for by a Mansion Tax on properties worth over £2 million, a levy
on tobacco firms, and by tackling tax avoidance. The threshold for the Mansion
Tax will rise in line with house prices for these high-value properties, and those
on lower incomes will be protected with a right to defer the charge until the
property changes hands.

We will guarantee people a GP appointment within 48 hours, and on the same
day for those who need it. We will create a Cancer Treatments Fund so patients
have access to the latest drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. By 2020, patients will
wait no longer than one week for vital cancer tests. Catching the disease early

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015 33

34

is critical, So we will raise public awareness of symptoms and make sure there
is training and support for GPs in spotting early signs.

The answer to the health challenges we face is not to set hospital against
hospital, but to join up services around patients’ needs. We will repeal the
Government's Health and Social Care Act, scrapping the competition regime
and restoring proper democratic accountability for the NHS. We will establish a
sensible commissioning framework, based on the principle of an NHS preferred
provider, to stop the drive towards privatisation and make sure that NHS
services are not destabilised by competition and fragmentation. Where private
companies are involved in providing clinical services, we will impose a cap on
any profits they can make from the NHS, to ensure that the needs of patients
are always put first. We support the principles behind the negotiations on the
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Treaty (TTIP). We will hold the
European Commission to account on issues of concern, including the impact
on public services and the Investor to State Dispute Settlement Mechanism.
And we will ensure the NHS is protected from the TTIP treaty.

Our health reforms will focus on prevention and early intervention, and joining
up services from home to hospital. When people cannot get to see their GP,
many go to A&E instead. When mental health problems are not spotted early,
people can deteriorate and need more intensive support. And when elderly
people cannot get the care they need at home, they are more likely to end up
in hospital.

The current system is too fragmented. It was not designed for the growing
numbers of people living with chronic conditions or multiple needs. Rather
than having three separate systems for dealing with physical, mental and social
care, we will create a whole person approach: a single service to meet all of a
person's health and care needs.

This will be underpinned by new rights for patients. Vulnerable older people,
disabled people and those with complex needs will be helped to have more
control of their lives with the entitlement to a personal care plan designed

PROVIDING WORLD-CLASS HEALTH AND EDUCATION SERVICES

with them and shaped around their needs, the option of personal budgets
where appropriate, and a single named person to coordinate their care. They
will also receive better information and advice on managing their condition.
These changes will help to end the frustration of families sick of being passed
from pillar to post between different individuals and agencies.

Commissioning and budgets will be brought together at a local level to join
up services and make sure that providers are incentivised to help people stay
healthy and outside hospital, rather than simply waiting for them to fall ill.

Mental health will be given the same priority as physical health. People will
have the same right to psychological therapies as they currently have to drugs
and medical treatments. To help address the problem of undiagnosed mental
illness, NHS staff training will include mental health. We will increase the
proportion of the mental health budget that is spent on children, and make
sure that teachers have training so they can identify problems early and link
children up with support. To support young people's health and wellbeing, we
will encourage the development of social and emotional skills, for example
through the use of mindfulness to build resilience. And we will set out a strategy
with the goal of ensuring that the great majority of patients can access talking
therapies within 28 days, and that all children who need it can access school-
based counselling.

A greater emphasis on prevention and public health is essential, not just to
improve outcomes and tackle inequalities, but to ensure the NHS remains
sustainable. For example, 3.2 million people are currently diagnosed with
diabetes, and it is estimated that spending on treatment will rise from £10
billion to £17 billion a year over the next 25 years if action is not taken, such
as to reduce levels of obesity. We will set a new national ambition to improve
the uptake of physical activity and take targeted action on those high strength,
low cost alcohol products that fuel problem drinking. And we will set maximum
permitted levels of sugar, salt and fat in foods marketed substantially to
children.

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

35

36

Everyone involved in the NHS must learn lessons when things go wrong, for
example, from the failings at Mid-Staffordshire and Morecambe Bay. Labour
will prioritise action to improve care quality and patient safety. In addition to
recruiting extra nurses to help provide safe levels of staffing on wards, we want
every hospital death to be subject to an appropriate level of review. We will also
take action to modernise the regulation of healthcare professionals.

Care in older age

Labour will support people in their older age. Growing old should be a positive
and fulfilling experience. But our social care system is close to collapse, with
older people often receiving visits limited to just 15 minutes, provided by a
workforce that is too often undervalued.

Labour supports measures to cap the costs of care and will prioritise improving
the quality of care services.

Working with local authorities and care providers, Labour will end time-limited
15-minute visits, introducing year-of-care budgets to incentivise better care in
the home. By stopping the use of zero-hours contracts, where regular hours
are being worked, we will improve the working life of care workers.

For older people, the normal setting for care should increasingly be the home,
not the hospital. We will recruit 5,000 new home-care workers - a new arm
of the NHS - to help care for those with the greatest needs at home. This will
include supporting more people to remain at home at the end of their life,
including those who are terminally ill with the greatest care needs.

We will also introduce a system of safety checks to identify risks facing
vulnerable older people and enable preventative measures to be put in place,
such as grab rails to prevent falling.

PROVIDING WORLD-CLASS HEALTH AND EDUCATION SERVICES

The burden of the care crisis is falling on carers, especially women, who
account for six in every ten carers. Labour will introduce a new duty on NHS
organisations to identify carers so that they can be linked up with the right
support. We will ring-fence the money councils get for carers’ breaks to ensure
this money gets spent on carers.

A high quality education for all our children

Labour sees investment in education as an investment both in our children
and in the future of the country. We will protect the entire education budget,
including the early years, schools and post-16 education, so that it rises in line
with inflation.

However investment on its own is not enough. We need to create a route
to success for the 50 per cent of young people who do not go down the
traditional academic route. We will raise the standard and status of vocational
and technical education, with a high quality vocational route from school
through to employment. The Technical Baccalaureate, a vocational award for
16 to 18-year-olds, will combine a gold-standard qualification accredited by
employers, with a quality work placement.

We will transform high performing Further Education colleges with strong links
to industry, into new specialist Institutes of Technical Education, with a remit to
deliver the Technical Baccalaureate and higher-level skills. We will support more
young people to gain the core skills they need for employment and further
study. With Labour, students will continue to study English and Maths to age 18
and undertake work experience between the ages of 14 and 16. And to ensure
young people are equipped to make the best choices for their future, we will
introduce a new, independent system of careers advice, offering personalised
face-to-face guidance on routes into university and apprenticeships.

 

We believe fundamentally that a world-class education system is made by
excellent teachers. With Labour, every teacher will need to gain qualified teacher
status. We will encourage teaching quality by creating new career routes for
teachers who are expert in their subject. These teachers will be able to attain

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

37

38

a new ‘Master Teacher’ status. Teachers will also be expected to update their
knowledge and skills as a condition of remaining in the profession, and we will
support plans for a new College of Teaching. These measures will help us close
the attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their peers, and work
towards all children reading well by age 11. We have supported the successful
‘Teach First’ since its inception and will continue to do so.

A new School Leadership Institute will support headteachers and improve
school leadership. It will accredit gold-standard headship qualifications,
support leadership training and development, and identify and develop the
school leaders of the future.

The Government has attempted to oversee thousands of schools from the
centre. This approach is not working. Underperformance is going unchallenged
and parents do not have enough of a voice. Labour will introduce new Directors
of School Standards at a local level to monitor performance, intervene in
underperforming schools and support them to improve.

Where a majority of local parents have concerns about underperformance, or
a dip in standards, they will be able to call in their local Director of School
Standards to hold a school to account.

Labour will promote innovation in schools. We will give all schools freedoms
currently only granted to some. Directors of School Standards will be responsible
for commissioning new schools where there is a shortage of school places,
encouraging innovative bids from established providers, good local authorities,
parents, teachers and entrepreneurs. They will also encourage local schools to
work together to improve the quality of education.

We will end the wasteful and poorly performing Free Schools programme, and
switch resources to where they are needed, allowing us to cap class sizes for
five, six and seven-year-olds at 30 pupils or under.

Private schools currently benefit from generous state subsidies, including
business rates relief worth hundreds of millions of pounds. We believe they
should do more to contribute to raising standards in state education to justify
receiving this subsidy. As a condition for continued business rate relief, private

PROVIDING WORLD-CLASS HEALTH AND EDUCATION SERVICES

schools will be required to form a meaningful partnership with a school, or
cluster of schools, in the state sector.

Children develop and learn best when they are secure and happy. We need
to help our children develop the creativity, self-awareness and emotional skills
they need to get on in life. We will introduce compulsory age-appropriate sex
and relationships education. We will encourage all schools to embed character
education across the curriculum, working with schools to stop the blight of
homophobic bullying.

Labour will:

\ s a country we value compassion, tolerance and a sense of decency.
But pressures on family life, growing inequality, anxieties about crime
and anti-social behaviour, and a widespread loss of trust in our governing

institutions, are creating insecurity in many communities.

Labour believes a decent society grows out of family life and relationships, out
of the work we do, and the local places to which we belong. We will help to
create a more secure and inclusive society by building and strengthening the
institutions that help individuals, families and communities to thrive.

Supporting families and relationships

People’s relationships bind society together, and the family, in all its various
shapes and sizes, is its bedrock. But low pay, the pressures of work and caring
for children and elderly relatives, have put families under increasing pressure.

We will help families by expanding free childcare from 15 to 25 hours per week
for working parents of three and four-year-olds, paid for with an increase in
the bank levy. We will also introduce a legal guarantee for parents of primary
school children to access wraparound childcare from 8am to 6pm through their
local primary school. As well as helping parents, this will provide children with
before and after-school clubs and activities, helping to raise their aspirations
and attainment. This will be underpinned by a new National Primary Childcare
Service, a not for profit organisation to promote the voluntary and charitable
delivery of quality extracurricular activities.

Labour recognises the vital importance of the power of people's relationships
to build the capacity for love, care and resilience. We will prioritise early years
intervention to give children and parents the best start in family life, and restore
the role of Sure Start centres as family hubs. Sure Start will have an obligation
to provide families with access to childcare, opening their facilities to charities
and local childcare providers. More widely, we will encourage local services to
co-locate, so that they work together to shift from sticking plaster solutions to
integrated early help.

HELPING OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES TO THRIVE

We will take a whole-family approach to policy making, supporting relationships,
and the involvement of fathers, grandparents and relatives in the care,
education and health of children.

More fathers want to play an active role in their children’s lives and families
want to spend more time together with a new baby. So we will double the
current two weeks of paternity leave to four weeks, and increase the amount of
paternity pay from £140 to more than £260 a week. Many grandparents want
to be more involved in caring for their grandchildren, and we will support them
in doing so.

As a result of this Government's failures, the commitment to ending child
poverty by 2020 is very unlikely to be met. However, we will never forget how
important a decent basic income is to a child's prospects and wellbeing. That
is why we will keep the child poverty targets, and ask the Office for Budget
Responsibility to monitor and report on progress.

We will promote the care and educational achievement of our most vulnerable
children and we will introduce mandatory reporting of child abuse. We will
increase support for children in kinship (family and friends) care and their
families, a group too often overlooked and undervalued. We will continue to
support Frontline and its innovative approach to training social workers, and
teachers will receive better training for working with children with special
educational needs and disabilities.

Building new homes

Britain is in the midst of the biggest housing crisis in a generation, with the
lowest levels of house building in peacetime since the 1920s. Young people
have been priced out of home ownership. Fewer affordable homes are being
built, homelessness is rising, and millions face insecurity and poor standards in
the private rented sector.

Everyone should be able to live in a secure home, whether they rent or buy. We
will make sure that at least 200,000 homes a year get built by 2020 - almost

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

45

46

double the current level - by implementing the recommendations of the Lyons
Review. It is only by building more homes that people's aspiration for home
ownership will be fulfilled.

Our comprehensive plan to tackle the housing crisis will give local communities
new powers to provide the homes they need, in the places they want to live.
To help young people and families get on the housing ladder, we will give local
authorities the power to give first call to first time buyers on new homes in
areas of housing growth. And we will unlock a Future Homes Fund by requiring
that the billions of pounds saved in Help to Buy ISAs be invested in increasing
housing supply.

We want a housing market that rewards the building of high quality homes
rather than land banking and speculation. So we will introduce greater
transparency in the land market and give local authorities new ‘use it or lose it’
powers to encourage developers to build.

We will increase competition in the housebuilding industry by backing small
builders, including through our Help to Build scheme, and by getting the public
sector building again. We will build more affordable homes by prioritising capital
investment for housing and by reforming the council house financing system.
We will give local authorities powers to reduce the number of empty homes,
including higher council tax on long term empty properties. And to boost the
housing we need, we will start to build a new generation of garden cities.

For the 11 million people who rent privately, we will legislate to make
three-year tenancies the norm, with a ceiling on excessive rent rises. A ban on
unfair letting agent fees will save renters over £600. We will drive standards up
by creating a national register of private landlords.

Homelessness is the ultimate symbol of the housing crisis. Labour reduced
homelessness by 70 per cent when we were last in office, but all forms of
homelessness are back on the rise, with rough sleeping having increased by
55 per cent. We are committed to reversing this trend by tackling the causes of
homelessness and rough sleeping.

HELPING OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES TO THRIVE

Restoring social security

Britain needs a responsible and fair social security system that provides
security when people lose their jobs or fall sick, as well as a decent income
when they retire. The British people have always believed in the principle of
contribution, rewarding those who pay in, helping people get back on their feet,
and providing support in times of need.

To guarantee a decent social security system for the next generation, we
need to keep costs under control. Under this Government, the increase in low
pay has left working families more reliant on tax credits and housing benefit,
pushing up the social security bill.

To get the benefits bill under control, we need to tackle the root causes of
rising spending, by making work pay and building more homes. We will allow
local authorities that negotiate rent reductions on behalf of tenants who are
claiming housing benefit, to retain some of the savings, on the condition that
the money is invested in building homes.

We will keep the household benefit cap and ask the Social Security Advisory
Committee to examine if it should be lower in some areas. And we will cap
structural social security spending as part of each spending review, so that it is
properly planned and controlled.

Labour believes in rewarding work and in restoring contribution to the heart of
our system. So we will not cut tax credits. We want everyone who can to have
the chance to contribute through paid work, so we will create a more tailored
back-to-work system that helps people secure and keep jobs. We will do more
to help unemployed people get the skills they need for work, testing jobseekers’
Maths, English and IT skills within six weeks of them claiming benefits. They will
be required to take up training where this will improve their chances of getting
a job. We support the principle behind Universal Credit - that there should be
a smooth transition into work - but it must be affordable and fit for purpose,
so we will pause and review the programme.

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

47

48

There will be a guaranteed, paid job for all young people who have been out
of work for one year, and for all those over 25 years old and out of work for
two years. It will be a job that they have to take, or lose their benefits. And we
will commission a replacement for the Work Programme at a more local level,
working with local authorities to join up support for the long-term unemployed.
We will introduce a higher rate of Job Seekers Allowance for those who have
contributed over years. It will be funded by extending the length of time people
need to have worked to qualify.

Supporting disabled people to live independently

Alongside strong and responsive public services, the social security system plays
an important role in supporting many disabled people to live independently,
and must always treat sick and disabled people with dignity.

Half a million families have been hit by the Bedroom Tax, and two thirds of
those affected are disabled, or have a disabled family member. It is cruel, and
we will abolish it.

We will reform the Work Capability Assessment and focus it on the support
disabled people need to get into work. We will give an independent scrutiny
group of disabled people a central role in monitoring it. And we will introduce
a specialist support programme to ensure that disabled people who can work
get more tailored help.

Older people

Older people deserve to live a fulfilling life, to continue working if they wish,
and to enjoy a secure retirement. Older people have contributed all their lives
and built the Britain that the next generation will inherit. So it is right that they
are supported with a fair and sustainable pensions system, responsive health
services and a system of care over which they have control. We will keep the
triple-lock so that the state pension increases by inflation, earnings, or 2.5 per

HELPING OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES TO THRIVE

cent, whichever is highest. And while increases in the state retirement age are
necessary to keep our pensions system affordable, we will ensure that people
have time to plan for changes.

We have taken the tough choice to restrict Winter Fuel Payments for the
richest five per cent of pensioners, but we will guarantee that there will be no
additional changes to the Winter Fuel Payments, free TV licences or bus passes
for pensioners.

Alongside a decent state pension, we must ensure private pensions are good
value for those who have saved. We will reform the pensions market so that
pension providers put savers first, and protect consumers from retirement
rip-offs. We support greater flexibility for those drawing down their pension
pots, but there must be proper guidance for people to avoid mis-selling.

Controlling immigration with fair rules

For our country to stay strong, with the confidence to look outwards rather
than inwards, people need to feel secure in the strength of our borders, our
communities, and in the workplace.

Britain has seen historically high levels of immigration in recent years, including
low-skilled migration, which has given rise to public anxiety about its effects on
wages, on our public services, and on our shared way of life.

Despite the Conservatives’ promise to reduce net migration to tens of
thousands, it is now higher than it was when David Cameron entered Downing
Street. Broken promises erode trust.

Labour will never cut Britain off from the rest of the world. Our economy and
our society benefit from the talent and investment of people who come here,
including university students coming to study. But the system needs to be
controlled and managed so that it is fair. Low-skilled migration has been too
high and needs to come down. We need much stronger action to stop illegal
immigration.

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

49

50

Labour's plan starts with stronger borders. We will recruit an additional 1,000
borders staff, paid for by a small charge on non-visa visitors to the UK. We
will introduce stronger controls to prevent those who have committed serious
crimes coming to Britain, and to deport those who commit crimes while they
are here. We will introduce full exit checks, so that we can count people in
and out of the country. Short-term student visitor visas have dramatically
increased, so we will tighten the system to prevent abuse, whilst welcoming
overseas university students who bring billions into Britain. And we will keep
the cap on workers from outside the EU.

We need fair rules at work to prevent the exploitation of migrant workers,
which undercuts local wages and increases demand for further low-skilled
migration. Labour will introduce a new law to stop employers undercutting
wages by exploiting workers. We will ban recruitment agencies from hiring only
from overseas and crack down on rogue agencies by extending the remit of the
Gangmasters Licensing Authority where there is evidence of abuse.

We need to strengthen our social integration and ensure that migrants can
play their part in British society. People working in public services, in public
facing roles, will be required to speak English. Those who come here will not be
able to claim benefits for at least two years, and we will stop child benefit being
sent to families living abroad.

We will enforce immigration rules humanely and effectively. We will end the
indefinite detention of people in the asylum and immigration system, ending
detention for pregnant women and those who have been the victims of sexual
abuse or trafficking. And we will ensure Britain continues its proud history of
providing refuge for those fleeing persecution by upholding our international
obligations, including working with the UN to support vulnerable refugees from
Syria.

Safer communities

Crime creates fear and insecurity. We can only live happy and fulfilled lives if
we know that we are safe, and that we are not at risk of violation of our person
or property.

For too many people in our country that is not the reality they see in their
communities. Neighbourhood policing, the vital building block of British policing,
is at risk of being destroyed. Anti-social behaviour is too often tolerated, rather
than dealt with. Violent crimes have gone up, but fewer violent criminals are
being caught. Far too many victims of child sex abuse are being let down by the
services that are supposed to keep them safe.

Labour believes British policing is at its best when it is rooted in local
communities, proactively preventing crime, rather than simply reacting to
emergencies.

We will protect neighbourhood policing. By making different choices - to abolish
Police and Crime Commissioners, end the subsidy of firearms licenses, and
mandate police forces to work closer together - we will be able to safeguard
over 10,000 police officers for the next three years. This will be backed up
by a new statutory Local Policing Commitment, guaranteeing neighbourhood
policing in every community.

We will strengthen community safety partnerships to give local people a role in
setting priorities for neighbourhood policing and a say over the appointment
of local police commanders.

To raise standards within policing, all police officers will be required to become
Chartered Officers, holding a registration with the College of Policing, and able
to be struck off for serious misconduct, just as doctors and lawyers can be. A
new Police Standards Authority will replace the discredited Independent Police
Complaints Commission. And we will work with the police to improve ethnic
minority recruitment so that the police better reflect the communities they
serve.

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

51

52

The next part of Labour's plan is preventing crime occurring in the first place.
We will nip anti-social behaviour in the bud by making offenders put right the
wrong they have done, with payback orders replacing low-level cautions. And
we will ensure staff who work with the public are given greater protection, with
tougher penalties for those who assault them.

The last Labour Government's reforms of youth justice, which required agencies
to collaborate in preventing youth offending, reduced both youth crime and
the numbers of young people in prison. The next Labour Government will
extend this model, piloting a new approach to 18 to 20-year-old offenders,
incentivising local authorities, police and probation services to work together
to identify those at risk of drifting into criminal activity and, where possible,
divert them into a more constructive way of life. And we will work to embed
restorative justice right across the youth justice system.

We know drug addiction continues to be a major cause of crime. We will ensure
drug treatment services focus on the root causes of addiction, with proper
integration between health, police and local authorities in the commissioning of
treatment. And we will ban the sale and distribution of dangerous psychoactive
substances, so called ‘legal highs’.

It is clear that we need a radical change in our approach to dealing with child
abuse. We will bring in tough new powers enabling the police to prevent an
adult from contacting or communicating with a child if there is evidence of
abuse, and strengthen the vetting and barring regime. A new child protection
unit will be established to work across government, driving progress in the
prevention of child abuse and sexual exploitation.

We need prisons that both punish and rehabilitate people. Labour will do more
to increase the amount of time prisoners spend working and learning. Prisons
will be measured by how successful they are in reforming prisoners and
reducing their re-offending. We will also raise professional standards amongst
prison officers, including through the creation of Chartered Prison Officers, and
confront the neglected problem of staff corruption.

HELPING OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES TO THRIVE

We will enact Britain's first Victims’ Law to give victims of crime a voice and an
entitlement to minimum standards of service from criminal justice agencies.

Ending violence against girls and women

Two women a week are killed by a current or former male partner. At least
750,000 children a year witness domestic violence. Stopping violence against
women and girls is a priority for Labour.

We will publish a Violence against Women and Girls Bill, appoint a commissioner
to set minimum standards in tackling domestic and sexual violence, and provide
more stable central funding for women's refuges and Rape Crisis Centres.

We will strengthen the law, banning the use of community resolutions as a
response to domestic violence. The gun licensing regime will be tightened, so
that people with a history of domestic or sexual violence will not be given an
unrestricted license. And we will make changes to DNA retention, so that rape
suspects have their DNA recorded and stored.

Victims of domestic violence need far better support. So we will widen access
to legal aid for victims of domestic violence.

Tackling the threat from extremism

The threat from Islamist extremism is increasing. Hundreds of British citizens
have joined Islamic State - a movement that has engaged in savage violence,
and racial and religious hatred.

The British people have faced down terrorist threats before and will do so
again, standing united together, not allowing ourselves to be divided.

With Labour, the security services will have the powers they need to disrupt
and tackle terrorism. The Government were wrong to weaken counter terror
powers by scrapping Control Orders. With Labour, dangerous suspects will be
subject to proper controls.

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

53

54

Every government department will be engaged in the work of preventing
extremism and fighting terrorism. We will implement a much more rigorous
strategy for dealing with people returning from the Syrian conflict. Alongside
appropriate police action and prosecution, it will be mandatory for anyone
returning to engage in a de-radicalisation programme designed to confront
them with the consequences of their actions.

We will need to update our investigative laws to keep up with changing
technology, strengthening both the powers available, and the safeguards
that protect people's privacy. This is why Labour argued for an independent
review, currently being undertaken by David Anderson. We will strengthen the
oversight of our intelligence agencies to make sure the public can continue to
have confidence in the vital work that they do to keep us safe.

To defeat the threats of Islamist terrorism, we must also engage with the
personal, cultural and wider factors that turn young people to extremism. The
Prevent programme was set up under the last Labour Government to stop
young people becoming radicalised. But this Government has cut the funding
and narrowed its focus. Much of the work to engage Muslim communities has
been lost.

We will overhaul the programme to involve communities in countering extremist
propaganda, stopping young people being groomed, and also building resilient
institutions for social integration. We applaud those faith communities who
have pioneered an inter-faith dialogue for the common good.

We will take a zero-tolerance approach to hate crime, such as anti-Semitism
and Islamophobia. We will challenge prejudice before it grows, whether in
schools, universities or on social media. And we will strengthen the law on
disability, homophobic, and transphobic hate crime.

Arts and culture

Labour believes that art and culture gives form to our hopes and aspirations
and defines our heritage as a nation. The arts allow us to celebrate our common

HELPING OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES TO THRIVE

humanity in the creation and celebration of beauty. The arts should belong to
all and be open to all to take part in.

We will guarantee a universal entitlement to a creative education so that every
young person has access to cultural activity and the arts by strengthening
creative education in schools and after-school clubs. Institutions that receive
arts funding will be required to open up their doors to young people, and we
will work with public bodies to rebalance arts funding across the country.

The last Labour Government made admission to our national museums
and galleries free to all, leading to a major increase in the number of people
experiencing our greatest cultural treasures. We reaffirm our commitment to
universal free admission to ensure that our great works of art and national
heritage can be enjoyed in all parts of the country.

Creativity is the powerhouse of a prosperous economy. It is the source of
economic innovation and a powerful force in social renewal. We will increase
the number of apprenticeships in the creative industries.

We will create a Prime Minister's Committee on the Arts, Culture and
Creative Industries, with a membership drawn from all sectors and regions.
The Committee will bring issues of concern direct to the attention of the Prime
Minister.

Sport

Sport brings us together in an expression of our local and national pride. It
is where young people learn about leadership, teamwork, the pursuit of
excellence and strength of character. With a Labour Government our children
will participate in a minimum of two hours of organised sport every week at
school.

Football clubs are an important part of many people's identity and sense of
belonging. They are more than just businesses. But despite their importance
in the lives of their members and supporters, too often there are no effective
means for fans to have a say in how their clubs are run. Labour will provide

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

55

56

the means for supporters to be a genuine part of their clubs. We will introduce
legislation to enable accredited supporters trusts to appoint and remove at
least two of the directors of a football club and to purchase shares when the
club changes hands. We will also review the role of fan participation in other
sports.

We will ensure the Premier League delivers on its promise to invest five per
cent of its domestic and international television rights income into funding the
grassroots.

Protecting our environment

We feel passionately about our local landscapes, our open spaces and wildlife.
Land and nature are part of our common home and inheritance, and they
contribute to our sense of identity. In a globalised world, our local environment
provides us with a sense of place and belonging.

As we Set out in more detail later on, a Labour Government will play a leading
global role in tackling climate change. However, it will not be enough to simply
mitigate the threat of climate change. We must adapt to its damaging effects,
which are impacting on us today. We will produce an ambitious adaptation
programme, and the new Infrastructure Commission will prioritise investment
in flood prevention. We will deal with the problems of air pollution by giving
local authorities the powers they need, backed up by a national framework.

Labour has always believed that everyone should have access to nature,
whoever they are, or wherever they live. So we will keep our forests in public
ownership, and promote access to green spaces in local planning. We will
support the work of the Natural Capital Committee to protect and improve
wildlife habitats and green spaces, and make them an important part of our
thriving tourism industry.

HELPING OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES TO THRIVE

We will build on our strong record on animal welfare - starting with an end
to the Government's ineffective and cruel badger cull. We will improve the
protection of dogs and cats, ban wild animals in circuses, defend the hunting
ban and deal with wildlife crime associated with shooting.

We want to create a world-leading Food, Farm and Fisheries sector that creates
better paid jobs and apprenticeships across the rural economy. We will put in
place a long-term strategy for the sector, promote the best of British produce,
and expand the role of the supermarket watchdog to support the growth of
the sector, and protect food producers from unfair practices by the major
supermarkets.

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

Labour will:

extend free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for working parents of three
and four-year-olds, and ensure all primary schools guarantee access to
wraparound childcare from 8am to 6pm

double paternity leave from two to four weeks and increase paternity pay
by more than £100 a week

ensure at least 200,000 new homes a year are built by 2020, with first

introduce a compulsory jobs guarantee, paid for by a Bank Bonus Tax
abolish the Bedroom Tax

VV"" will reform

to give more power

eople who live in this country know that too much power is
Pee nctea in too few hands. Those who make decisions on behalf
of others, whether they are in Westminster, the European Union, in
business, the media, or the public sector, are too often unaccountable. Our
over-centralised system of government has prevented our nations, cities,
county regions and towns from being able to take control and change

things for themselves. We will end a century of centralisation.

Labour believes meaningful and lasting change for the better is only possible
when people are given the power to change things for themselves. Our
governing mission is to break out of the traditional top-down, 'Westminster
knows best approach’, and devolve power and decision-making to people and
their local communities.

From the City of London to Silicon Valley the world's best industries tend to be
clustered geographically. And too often economic challenges can be too, from
our coalfields to some of our isolated seaside towns. So a Labour government
will unleash the potential of our city and county regions to drive economic
growth and prosperity. We will reform institutions and devolve power to
deal with the causes of our economic problems, and we will encourage local
authorities to innovate to better serve their communities.

Instead of imposing change on communities, we will give them more control over
schools, health care, policing, skills, housing and transport, making use of their
insights into what works and what does not. We will promote and encourage a
model of citizenship based on participation and shared responsibility.

These measures are the start of big changes in how we govern ourselves as
a union of nations. They will begin to transform the relationship between the
citizen and the state.

We will further develop digital government to enable better communication,
more collaboration, and sharing of data between services. It will make services
and transactions more efficient and simpler for people to use. To create amore
connected society we will support making digital government more inclusive,

REFORMING GOVERNMENT TO GIVE MORE POWER TO PEOPLE

transparent and accountable. We will continue to back the principle of ‘open
data by default’, releasing public sector performance data wherever possible.

A better politics

We will give 16 and 17-year-olds the vote by May 2016, and improve the
curriculum for citizenship education, so young people have the knowledge they
need to play a full part in British society. We will encourage young people's
volunteering and social action by supporting the #iwill campaign of ‘Step up to
Serve’, and the National Citizens Service.

Drawing on the work of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, we
will take steps to ensure that the move to individual electoral registration does
not leave millions unregistered, nor lead to constituencies that fail to take into
account the people who live in them. This will include block registration by
universities and care homes, extending Northern Ireland's successful Schools
Initiative, and exploring the scope for an automatic system of registration.
Labour remains committed to reforming political party funding and taking the
big money out of politics by capping individual donations to parties.

We will safeguard our democracy by repealing the Lobbying Act, which has
gagged charities, and replace it with a tougher statutory register of lobbyists.
We will ban MPs from holding paid directorships and consultancies. And we
will reform the legislative process to strengthen the public's voice and to better
hold the government to account.

The United Kingdom

Labour believes in the historic union of our nations working together for the
common good. But as devolution has continued to gather pace, our union
now needs to evolve. As a priority, we will set up a people-led Constitutional
Convention to directly address this and to drive political reform of Westminster.

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

63

64

Labour is committed to replacing the House of Lords with an elected Senate
of the Nations and Regions, to represent every part of the United Kingdom,
and to improve the democratic legitimacy of the second chamber. It is also
time to consider how English MPs can have a greater role in the scrutiny of
legislation that only affects England. This includes the option put forward by Sir
William McKay, of a committee stage made up of English-only MPs. These ideas
must now be considered as part of the Constitutional Convention process.

England

We will embark on the biggest devolution of power to our English city and
county regions in a hundred years with an English Devolution Act. It will transfer
£30 billion of funding to city and county regions, along with new powers over
economic development, skills, employment, housing, and business support.
This will include control over local transport systems so that in future, local
bodies can integrate trains, buses, trams and cycling into a single network. We
will enable city and county regions to retain 100 per cent of additional business
rates raised from growth in their area.

Fair funding will be restored across England, alongside longer term multi-year
budgets, so that local authorities can plan ahead on the basis of need in their
area and protect vital services. And an English Regional Cabinet Committee,
chaired by the Prime Minister, will be convened regularly, attended by the
relevant Secretaries of State and leaders of our major city and county regions.

In return for greater devolution of funding and responsibility, we will establish
local Public Accounts Committees, so that every pound spent by local bodies
creates value for money for local taxpayers.

Devolution does not end at town halls. Local people know best about the
complex problems they face, and they are best placed to work out how to
solve them.

The English New Deal begins the process of giving individuals and communities
more power and control over how they are governed and over the design of

REFORMING GOVERNMENT TO GIVE MORE POWER TO PEOPLE

their public services. It will support people who need care to live independently,
help troubled families to turn their lives around, and make sure that every child
has a good start in life with early-years intervention and quality childcare.

We will give English people a stronger voice in shaping the future of their local
NHS services. Patients and the public will have a seat at the table from the
very start of any process that draws up plans for change, including changes to
hospital services.

We will give local communities more power to shape their high streets, and
so preserve their local identities. Councils will be given the power to require
particular types of shops to apply for planning permission, allowing them to
restrict the number of payday lenders or other shops that are clustering on a
single high street. Communities will be able to review betting shop licenses in
their area and reduce the number of fixed-odds betting terminals in existing
betting shops - or ban them entirely - in response to local concerns.

Scotland

In September 2014, people across Scotland voted overwhelmingly for change.
Labour will keep its vow and implement the Smith Agreement in full. And we
will go further, with a Home Rule Bill to give extra powers to Scotland over tax,
welfare and jobs. Rates of income tax will be set in Scotland. Billions of pounds
of social security spending will be devolved, including benefits that support
disabled people. The Work Programme will also be devolved along with a
greater ability to invest in capital projects.

The new devolution settlement will recognise the strength and security offered
by being part of the United Kingdom. We will maintain the Barnett formula, and
Scotland will continue to benefit from pooling and sharing resources across
the UK.

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

65

66

Wales

Labour will put Welsh devolution on the same statutory basis as Scottish
devolution, with a clear principle that powers are devolved unless specifically
reserved, and that a Welsh legislature is apermanentfeature of our constitutional
arrangements. Wewilltake forward proposals fromthe SilkCommissionto extend
the power the people of Wales have over their elections, transport and energy.
An all-Wales Policing Plan will give the Welsh people the ability to shape local
policing in Wales.

Wales must not be unfairly disadvantaged by the Barnett formula. So while the
Conservatives have cut the Welsh budget by £1.5 billion, we will establish a fair
funding settlement for Wales, with the guarantee of a funding floor.

Northern Ireland

Labour is proud of the role we played in bringing peace and stability to Northern
Ireland through the Good Friday Agreement, and successive agreements. A
Labour Government will engage proactively with the Northern Ireland Executive
to support continued political progress, and deliver on it's vision of a shared
future. We will ensure the economic pact between the UK Government and
Northern Ireland Executive is focused on stimulating jobs and growth which
contribute to reducing unemployment and poverty in Northern Ireland. We
will continue to work with the Irish Government to secure peace in Northern
Ireland and strengthen relations between our two countries.

Rights and equality

The Labour Party has always led on challenging prejudice and discrimination
and we will continue to do so. People's differences are not excuses to treat
them badly or unjustly.

REFORMING GOVERNMENT TO GIVE MORE POWER TO PEOPLE

The next Labour Government will go further in reducing discrimination
against women, requiring large companies to publish their gender pay gap
and strengthening the law against maternity discrimination. Where there is
evidence more progress is needed, we will enforce the relevant provisions
within the Equality Act.

We want our Parliament to look more like Britain. We are proud of our record
in strengthening the representation of women, ethnic minorities, and other
under-represented groups in politics and public life. We remain committed
to achieving a better balance in Parliament, including through the use of all-
women shortlists in Labour Party parliamentary selection contests.

We will establish a comprehensive race equality strategy to break down the
barriers still faced by black and minority ethnic communities. Our aim is to
make sure our national institutions, including Parliament, the police, judiciary,
civil service, and the boardrooms of our companies, are more representative
of our diverse country.

We will also build on our history of championing LGBT rights, tackling
homophobia with tougher laws at home and greater engagement abroad.

Britain has a long tradition of liberty and the rule of law, and Labour has a
proud record of extending these to our most vulnerable citizens, by promoting
equality and opportunity for all.

Thanks to the Human Rights Act, some of our most vulnerable citizens, including
disabled people and victims of crime, have been given a powerful means of
redress. The Conservatives want to leave the European Convention of Human
Rights, and abolish the Human Rights Act. A Labour Government will stand up
for citizens’ individual rights, protecting the Human Rights Act and reforming,
rather than walking away from, the European Court of Human Rights. And
we will make sure that access to legal representation, a cornerstone of our
democracy, is not determined by personal wealth, but remains available to
those that need it.

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

67

68

Our Freedom of Information laws have shone a light into the darker corners
of government and are a crucial check on the power of the Executive. We will
extend their scope so that public services run by large private companies are
included. And we will repair the damage done by this Government to the vital
safeguard offered by judicial review.

The media

The free flow of information and of different points of view is crucial for open
debate and countering concentrations of unaccountable power. That is why the
concentration of media power in too few hands is damaging to our democracy.
No one media owner should be able to exert undue influence on public opinion
and policy makers. No media company should have so much power that those
who run it believe themselves above the rule of law.

Yet the current system for protecting against these threats is inadequate.
Labour will take steps to protect the principle of media plurality, so that no
media outlet can get too big, including updating our rules for the 21st century
media environment.

We remain strongly committed to the implementation of the recommendations
of the Leveson Inquiry. We expect the industry to establish a mechanism for
independent self-regulation, which delivers proper redress for individuals, as
set out in the Royal Charter, and agreed by all parties in Parliament. We made
a promise to victims of the phone hacking scandal. We stand by that promise
and will keep it.

Our system of public service broadcasting is one of Britain’s great strengths.
The BBC makes a vital contribution to the richness of our cultural life, and
we will ensure that it continues to do so while delivering value for money. We
will also commit to keeping Channel 4 in public ownership, so it continues to
produce vital public content.

e live in turbulent times. The rise of ISIL, an aggressive Russia
Wioncctening its neighbours in eastern Europe, and continuing
economic uncertainty in the Eurozone, are each a challenge to our national
security. Labour is an internationalist party and believes Britain must
engage with the global challenges we face, but not try and solve them on
our own. We believe the Conservatives are damaging the interests of our
country by turning their backs on Europe, and isolating us abroad. We will
strengthen our national security, stand up for human rights, and work with
other countries to tackle terrorism, climate change, and eliminate extreme

poverty globally.

Britain has a unique influence in the world. We are the only country that is a
member of the UN Security Council, NATO, the G7, the G20, the Commonwealth
and the EU.

With Labour, Britain's response to threats to our security will be based on
enduring principles. We will protect our national interests, and strengthen our
long-standing international alliances, in particular, our membership of NATO
and the European Union. We will advance our international engagement,
rather than retreating into isolation. We will maintain the best Armed Forces
in the world, capable of responding to changing threats in an unpredictable
security landscape. And we will support human rights, always putting individual
freedom and democracy at the heart of our foreign policy.

One of our first acts in government will be to conduct a wide-ranging review
of Britain's place in the world and how we can best uphold our values and the
national interest.

Global challenges

We will take a multilateral approach to global challenges. We will continue to
uphold our key alliances. These include the United States, our allies in Africa
and Latin America, and our partners from across the Commonwealth. They

STANDING UP FOR BRITAIN’S INTERESTS IN EUROPE AND THE WORLD

also include the European Union. The crisis in Ukraine over the past year has
demonstrated the importance of NATO and the EU standing up to external
threats in Europe's eastern, and southern neighbourhoods. Labour will
continue to advocate an EU which looks outward to promote stability, peace
and prosperity on its borders.

Most immediately we will work with our allies to counter and confront terrorism.
ISIL's barbarism and expansionist ideology, alongside terrorist groups such
as Al Qaeda and Al-Shabaab, represent a particular threat to global security.
Following a request from the Iraqi Prime Minister, it was right that the UK joined
other nations in air strikes against ISIL targets in Iraq. But military action alone
will not defeat ISIL. A long-term multinational political strategy, with regional
actors playing a central role, is essential for tackling the rise of extremism
across the region.

A Labour Government will always do what is necessary to defend our country.
Beyond self-defence, Labour has been clear about the need to learn the lessons
of previous interventions, especially the 2003 invasion of Iraq. We will continue
the approach we have taken in this Parliament. A Labour Government would
not propose the use of military force without judging whether reasonable
diplomatic efforts have been exhausted, the action is proportionate and in
partnership with allies, whether there is a clear legal basis, and if there is a clear
plan, not just for winning the war but also for building a lasting peace.

Peace and security in the Middle East are one of Labour's most important
foreign policy objectives. We remain committed to a comprehensive two-state
solution - a secure Israel alongside a viable and independent state of Palestine.
There can be no military solution to this conflict and all sides must avoid taking
action that would make peace harder to achieve. Labour will continue to press
for an immediate return to meaningful negotiations leading to a diplomatic
resolution.

Labour will also continue to honour the UK’s commitment to support
Afghanistan as it seeks to secure an inclusive and durable political settlement.
In December 2014, the NATO-led ISAF mission in Afghanistan ended. We can
never repay the debt owed to the brave servicemen and women who have

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

75

76

sacrificed and risked their lives in Afghanistan to protect our national security.

As power and wealth continues to shift from West to East, our relationship with
Asia will be fundamental to our long-term prosperity. Labour will set up an Asia
Step-Change Taskforce to ensure a more strategic and effective dialogue with
regional partners, including China, both in the commerical realm, and in other
areas, from cultural exchange to human rights.

This commitment to universal human rights will be at the heart of our foreign
policy across the world. We will continue to promote women's rights. We
will join with those campaigning to attain gender equality, the eradication of
poverty and inclusive economic growth. We will appoint a Global Envoy for
Religious Freedom, and establish a multi-faith advisory council on religious
freedom within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. And we will appoint
an International LGBT Rights Envoy to promote respect for the human rights
of LGBT people, and work towards the decriminalisation of homosexuality
worldwide.

Europe

Labour believes that our membership of the European Union is central to
our prosperity and security. It is why we will work to change the EU, so that it
operates in the best interests of our country. And it is why we will re-engage
with our European allies to protect our national interest after five years of
Britain being sidelined in Europe and isolated abroad.

The economic case for membership of the EU is overwhelming. Over 3 million
jobs in the UK are linked to trade with the European Union, and almost half
of our trade and foreign investment comes from the EU. Competing in the
single market, with the best companies in the world, drives competitiveness
and innovation for firms in all parts of our economy. And it helps boost the
living standards of people across Britain, encouraging the inflow of capital and
investment.

STANDING UP FOR BRITAIN’S INTERESTS IN EUROPE AND THE WORLD

Our reforms will help deliver a Europe focused on jobs and growth, not simply
more austerity and rising unemployment. Labour will focus on the completion
of the single market and tougher budget discipline, including on those items
where spending at the EU level can save money at the national level. That
means driving reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and a Commission-led
zero-based review of spending on EU agencies to reduce waste and inefficiency.
We will not join the Euro, and we will ensure EU rules protect the interests of
non-Euro members.

A Labour Government helped to introduce sensible measures at EU level to
protect the rights of British workers, and we remain committed to fighting to
protect these measures.

People coming to Britain from the EU to look for work are expected to contribute
to our economy, and to our society. So we will secure reforms to immigration
and social security rules, as well as pushing for stronger transitional controls,
which will enable member states to manage the flow of workers for longer
when new countries join.

We will also continue to open up EU decision-making, and implement
institutional reforms to help build levels of trust among European citizens.
We will work to strengthen the influence national parliaments over European
legislation, by arguing for a ‘red-card mechanism’ for member states, providing
greater parliamentary scrutiny.

Labour's priority in government will be protecting the NHS and tackling the
cost-of-living crisis. It is not to take Britain out of Europe. However, Labour will
legislate for a lock that guarantees that there can be no transfer of powers
from Britain to the European Union without the consent of the British public
through an in/out referendum.

Defence and our Armed Forces

The primary duty of any governmentis the defence of the nation andits interests.
That is why Labour is committed to ensuring the UK has responsive, high-tech
Armed Forces, with the capability to respond to emerging, interconnected

THE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO 2015

77

78

threats, in an unpredictable security landscape. We will conduct a Strategic
Defence and Security Review in the first year of government, with an inclusive
national debate on the security and defence challenges facing the country. It will
be fiscally responsible and strategically driven, focusing on the obstacles that
impede our Armed Forces from effective response to threats.

At the heart of our defence policy are the service men and women, both regulars
and reservists, who risk their lives for their country. Labour will strengthen
the covenant between our nation and our Armed Forces, veterans and their
families. We will create a Veterans’ Register to make certain our veterans receive
proper support on leaving service.

We will continue to roll out Labour's Veterans’ Interview Programme, in
which companies voluntarily guarantee an interview for job-seeking ex-forces
personnel. We will introduce legislation to make discrimination against members
of our Armed Forces illegal, and we will enshrine the Military Covenant in the
NHS Constitution.

The UK defence and security industry is a key contributor to our economy, with
a turnover of £22 billion a year. We will work to secure defence jobs across the
UK, protect the supply chain and support industry to grow Britain's defence
exports. In partnership with industry, we will put accountability, value for money,
interoperability and sustainability at the centre of defence procurement.

Britain needs to be prepared to counter the threat of cyber-attacks. We have
already called on the Government to require every company working with
the Ministry of Defence, regardless of its size or the scale of its work, to sign
up to a cyber-security charter. This would reduce the risk of hackers using
small suppliers to break into the systems of major defence companies or the
department itself. We will consult on creating a statutory requirement for all
private companies, to report serious cyber-attacks threatening our national
infrastructure.

Labour remains committed to a minimum, credible, independent nuclear
capability, delivered through a Continuous At-Sea Deterrent. We will actively
work to increase momentum on global multilateral disarmament efforts and

STANDING UP FOR BRITAIN’S INTERESTS IN EUROPE AND THE WORLD

negotiations, and look at further reductions in global stockpiles and the
numbers of weapons.

Climate change

We will put climate change at the heart of our foreign policy. As the
terrible impact of the floods in Britain showed last year, climate change
is now an issue of national, as well as global security. From record
droughts in California, to devastating typhoons in the Philippines,
the world is already seeing the effects we once thought only future
generations would experience.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made clear that if
the worldis going to hold warming below two degrees (the internationally-
agreed goal), global emissions need to peak in around 2020, and then
decline rapidly to reach net zero emissions by the second half of this
century. The weaker the action now, the more rapid and costly the
reductions will need to be later.

The effects of climate change hit the poor, the hardest. If we do not tackle
climate change, millions of people will fall into poverty. We will expand
the role of the Department of International Development to mitigate the
risks of a changing climate, and support sustainable livelihoods for the
world's poorest people.

We want an ambitious agreement on climate change at the UNFCCC
conference in Paris, in December. We will make the case for ambitious
emissions targets for all countries, strengthened every five years on the
basis of a scientific assessment of the progress towards the below two
degree goal. And we will push for a goal of net zero global emissions
in the second half of this century, for transparent and universal rules
for measuring, verifying and reporting emissions, and for an equitable
deal in which richer countries provide support to poorer nations in
combatting climate change.

International development

We are proud that Labour MPs passed the historic law that commits Britain to
spend 0.7 per cent of our gross national income on international development.
Labour will use that commitment from the British public to transform the lives
of the world's poorest people, whilst ensuring value for taxpayers’ money. We
will work in fragile and conflict-affected states to improve the lives of those
affected by violence, prioritising the protection and education of women and
children. We will rebalance the budget to focus funding on the world’s poorest
countries.

While progress has been made towards the Millennium Development Goals,
it is unacceptable that over a billion people still live on less than $1.25 a day.
We will work with other countries at this year's Sustainable Development
Goals Summit to unite the world to eradicate extreme poverty, tackle growing
economic inequality, and place human rights at the heart of development. We
will establish a Centre for Universal Health Coverage to provide the support,
encouragement, and global partnerships needed to help countries provide
free healthcare. We will lead efforts to reshape the UN humanitarian system to
better equip it to save lives.

The private sector is essential to long-term development, and is often a positive
force for change. We will extend the sharing of tax information to developing
countries, increase DFID’s help to governments to collect more of their own
taxes, tackle corruption, and ensure good governance. We will work with
companies to ensure they have sustainable supply chains that are free from
slavery, treat their workers fairly, and pay taxes where they are due.

STANDING UP FOR BRITAIN’S INTERESTS IN EUROPE AND THE WORLD

Labour will:

conduct a Strategic Defence and Security Review in the first year of
government

return Britain to a leadership role in Europe, but reform the EU so that it
works for Britain

guarantee no powers will be transferred to Brussels without an in/out
referendum

appoint an International LGBT Rights Envoy and a Global Envoy for Religious
Freedom

outlaw discrimination against and abuse of members of the Armed Forces
enshrine the Military Covenant in the NHS Constitution

push for global targets to tackle inequality and promote human rights
establish a Centre for Universal Health Coverage

push for an ambitious target in Paris to get to goal of net zero global
emissions in the second half of this century.

ime for change

In this election the country has a choice.

Either we can carry on as we are, with an economy that might work for some in
the City of London but shuts out millions of people in the rest of the country.
A country in which young people are left facing a worse life than their parents
and an NHS under huge strain faces a real threat to its future.

Or we can change direction, together, with Labour.

We don't promise the earth. All our commitments in this manifesto are fully
funded, so they can be delivered without a penny of borrowing.

But our policies will bring hope and make Britain work for working people once
again.

Working people want an economy with better jobs and higher skills. Families
want to know they are guaranteed decent schools and good healthcare.
Mothers and fathers want a better future for their children. Individuals and
communities in every part of our country want to have control over their lives
and for those in power to be held to account. Everyone, young and old, wants
a sense of belonging and safety in their communities.

We deserve a country where everyone plays by the same rules, including those
at the top.

That's what this manifesto offers. It is the kind of country we know we
have it in ourselves to be. Let's build it together.

FOREWORD

A big part of being the leader of a political party is that you meet people
across the country and hear a wide range of views and ideas about the
future. For me, it’s been a reminder that our country is a place of dynamic,
generous and creative people with massive potential.

But I've also heard something far less
positive, something which motivates
us in the Labour Party to work for
the kind of real change set out in this
manifesto. It is a growing sense of
anxiety and frustration.

Faced with falling living standards,
growing job insecurity and shrinking
public services, people are under
increasing strain. Young people are
held back by debt and the cost of
housing. Whole families are being
held back from the life they have
worked towards.

I'm constantly told of these pressures
in the workplace. Faced with constant
cuts and interference, our police,
nurses, doctors, teachers and council
staff are held back from delivering
the public services they signed up to.

Workers are held back by falling
real pay and job security. Our
entrepreneurs and managers are
being held back from growing their
business. If you are increasingly
asked to do more with less, then
you are not alone.

Every election is a choice. What
makes this election different is that

the choice is starker than ever before.

You can choose more of the same:

the rich getting richer, more children
in poverty, our NHS failing and our
schools and social care in crisis.

Or you can vote for the party that
has a plan to change all of this -

The Labour Party.

Britain is the fifth richest country
in the world. But that means little
when many people don't share in
that wealth. Many feel the system
is rigged against them. And this
manifesto sets out exactly what
can be done about it.

Britain needs to negotiate a Brexit
deal that puts our economy and
living standards first. That won't

be achieved by empty slogans and
posturing. We cannot put at risk
our links with our largest trading
partner. Instead we need a jobs-first
Brexit that allows us to upgrade our
economy for the 21st century.

Labour will invest in the cutting-edge
jobs and industries of the future

that can improve everybody's lives.
Which is why this manifesto outlines
a fully costed programme to upgrade
our economy. From childcare

to transport, housing to lifelong
learning, Labour understands how

a successful economy depends on
services that support us all.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW.

So yes, this election is about what
sort of country we want to be after
Brexit. Is it one where the majority
are held back by the sheer struggle
of getting by? That isn’t the Britain
Labour is determined to create.

So let's build a fairer Britain where

no one is held back. A country where
everybody is able to get on in life, to
have security at work and at home, to
be decently paid for the work they do,
and to live their lives with the dignity
they deserve.

Let's build a country where we invest
our wealth to give everyone the
best chance. That means building

 

the homes we need to rent and
buy, keeping our communities safe
with more police officers, giving our
children’s schools the funding they
badly need, and restoring the NHS
to its place as the envy of the world.

Don't let the Conservatives hold
Britain back.

Let's build a Britain that works
for the many, not the few.

CREATING AN
ECONOMY THAT

CREATING AN
ECONOMY THAT
WORKS FOR ALL

Labour's economic strategy is
about delivering a fairer, more
prosperous society for the many,
not just the few.

We will measure our economic
success not by the number of
billionaires, but by the ability of our
people to live richer lives.

Labour understands that the creation
of wealth is a collective endeavour
between workers, entrepreneurs,
investors and government. Each
contributes and each must share
fairly in the rewards.

This manifesto sets out Labour's plan
to upgrade our economy and rewrite
the rules of a rigged system, so that
our economy really works for the
many, and not only the few. Britain is
the only major developed economy
where earnings have fallen even

as growth has returned after the
financial crisis. Most working people
in Britain today are earning less, after
inflation, than they did ten years ago.
Too many of us are in low-paid and
insecure work. Too many of us fear
our children will not enjoy the same
opportunities that we have.

Labour will turn this around.

We will upgrade our economy,
breaking down the barriers that hold
too many of us back, and tackling
the gender pay gap. Our National
Transformation Fund will deliver
the investment that every part of
Britain needs to meet its potential,
overcoming years of neglect. Our
industrial strategy will support
businesses to create new, high-
skilled, high-paid and secure work
across the country, in the sectors

of the future such as renewables.
We will stop our financial system
being rigged for the few, turning the
power of finance to work for the
public good. And we will put small
businesses at the centre of our
economic strategy.

The growth created by our national
investment plan, underpinned by the
responsible economic management
embodied in our Fiscal Credibility
Rule, will create good jobs, drive up
living standards and improve the
public finances.

It is a plan that will deliver Labour's
vision of an economy that works for
the many, not just the few - a Britain
in which no one is held back.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

 

 

 

A FAIR TAXATION
SYSTEM

Taxation is what underpins our
shared prosperity. All of us,
including business, benefit from
a healthy, educated and skilled
population, with access to basic
services and secure housing.

We believe in the social obligation

to contribute to a fair taxation scheme
for the common good. We will take

on the social scourge of tax avoidance
through our Tax Transparency and
Enforcement Programme, and close
down tax loopholes.

But we will not ask ordinary
households to pay more. A Labour
government will guarantee no rises

in income tax for those earning below
£80,000 a year, and no increases

in personal National Insurance
Contributions or the rate of VAT.

CHAPTER 01 CREATING AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL

Under Labour's plans, 95 per cent
of taxpayers will be guaranteed
no increase in their income tax
contributions, and everyone will
be protected from any increase

in personal National Insurance
contributions and VAT. Only the
op 5 per cent of earners will be
asked to contribute more in tax to
help fund our public services. We
renew our pledge not to extend VAT
0 food, children’s clothes, books
and newspapers, and public
ransport fares.

Corporation tax in the UK is the
owest of any major developed
economy. Our new settlement with
business will ask large corporations

‘0 pay a little more while still keeping
UK corporation tax among the lowest
of the major developed economies. In
urn, we will meet the business need
for a more skilled workforce with
extra corporate tax revenues while
contributing to education and

skills budgets.

 

We will protect small businesses by
reintroducing the lower small profits
rate of corporation tax. We will also
exclude small businesses from costly
plans to introduce quarterly reporting
and take action on late payments.

Labour will give HM Revenue &
Customs the resources and skills
necessary to clamp down hard on
those unscrupulous few individuals
and companies who seek to avoid the
responsibilities that the rest of us meet.

BALANCING
THE BOOKS

Our manifesto is fully costed, with
all current spending paid for out
of taxation or redirected revenue
streams. Our public services must
rest on the foundation of sound
finances. Labour will therefore

set the target of eliminating the
government's deficit on day-to-day
spending within five years.

But government must have a laser-
like focus on how we earn, as well as
how we spend. At the same time as
eliminating the current deficit, Labour
will invest in our future, to ensure
faster growth and help us to earn

our way as a country again.

To maintain good fiscal health, we will
have a firm rule in place to guide all
our taxation and spending decisions.
Our Fiscal Credibility Rule is based on
the simple principle that government
should not be borrowing for day-to-
day spending, but that future growth
depends on investment. It was
designed in conjunction with world-
leading economists. It also means we
are committed to ensuring that the
national debt is lower at the end of
the next Parliament than it is today.

Compliance with the rule will be
overseen by a strengthened and
truly independent Office for Budget

10

Responsibility, which we will make
accountable to Parliament. We will
also consult on implementing the

recommendations of the Kerslake
Review of the Treasury.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

INFRASTRUCTURE

INVESTMENT

Our country and its people
have been held back by a lack
of investment in the backbone
of a modern economy - the
infrastructure of transport,
communications and energy
systems. And when investment
has happened, it has been too
concentrated in too few places.

Labour will make different choices.
We will take advantage of near-
record low interest rates to create

a National Transformation Fund

that will invest £250 billion over ten
years in upgrading our economy.

We will ensure that the huge
potential of every part of our country
is met. The next Labour government
will rebuild communities ripped apart
by globalisation and neglected for
years by government. We will rebuild
and transform our economy so that
it works for the many, not the few.
So we will put in place tight rules

to ensure that investment is fairly
shared around every region and
nation of the UK. We will tear

down the barriers that have held

too many people back.

A Labour government will complete
the HS2 high-speed rail line from
London through Birmingham to
Leeds and Manchester, and then

CHAPTER 01 CREATING AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL

 

into Scotland, consulting with (and,
where necessary, compensating)
communities. We will link HS2 with
other rail investments, such as
Crossrail of the North (tying together
our great northern cities) and on to
the Durham Freight Centre. We will
build a new Brighton Main Line for
the South East.

In London, to ensure our capital
continues to prosper, we will build
Crossrail 2.

To harness the economic potential
of new technologies and science,
we will complete the Science Vale
transport arc, from Oxford to
Cambridge through Milton Keynes.

And we will deliver rail electrification
and expansion across the whole
country, including Wales and the
South West.

1

We will transform our energy
systems, investing in new, state-
of-the-art low-carbon gas and
renewable electricity production.

We will deliver universal superfast
broadband availability by 2022.
Labour will improve mobile internet
coverage and expand provision of
free public wi-fi in city centres and
on public transport. We will improve
4G coverage and invest to ensure all
urban areas, as well as major roads
and railways, have uninterrupted
5G coverage. On day one we will
instruct the National Infrastructure
Commission to report on how to roll
out ‘ultrafast’ (300Mbps) across the
UK within the next decade.

UPGRADING

OUR ECONOMY:

LABOUR'S
INDUSTRIAL
STRATEGY

Our economy is suffering from
years of neglect by governments
that have refused to support
our industries, businesses and
workers. This wasted potential
is holding us all back. Inequality
has ballooned as the economy
has shifted towards low-paid,
insecure jobs.

Britain's manufacturing base has
declined and we have relied too
heavily on the financial sector,
centred on London and the South

CHAPTER 01 CREATING AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL

East. And while the South East
struggles with a rising cost of living
crisis, many northern and coastal
towns have watched as their
economies and communities are left
behind. Britain's failure to get all its
regional and local economies working
can be seen in the deterioration

of the country’s current account,
weak productivity growth and
underinvestment in infrastructure.

Britain can only be stronger if every
nation and region is given the
resources and support to succeed.
Only a Labour government with

a credible industrial strategy can
reach this untapped potential and
deliver prosperity to every corner
of our country, working with
devolved administrations.

Our industrial strategy will be built
on objective, measurable missions
designed to address the great

13

challenges of our times. In meeting
these challenges, we will move
beyond the narrow approaches of
the past, and mobilise the talents and
resources of our whole country to
deliver an economy fit for the future.

The first missions set by a Labour
government will be to:

1. ensure that 60 per cent of the UK’s
energy comes from zero-carbon
or renewable sources by 2030

2. create an innovation nation with
the highest proportion of high-
skilled jobs in the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and
Development by 2030. We will
meet the OECD target of 3 per cent
of GDP spent on research
and development by 2030.

In order to create a fertile ground for
businesses to achieve these missions
Labour will take action across the
areas we know are necessary for
business and industry to grow:

+ Skills - by creating a National
Education Service for England.

+ Infrastructure - by investing £250
billion over the next ten years.

+ UK supply chains - by targeting
government support where there
are gaps.

+ Trade - by negotiating a new deal
with Europe that puts jobs and the
economy first.

14

+ Procurement - by requiring the
best standards on government
contracts.

+ Research and development -
by committing extra research
investment.

+ Energy costs and security - by
capping costs and investing in new
publicly owned energy provision.

While our industrial strategy is one
for growth across all sectors, Labour
recognises that certain sectors are

of strategic significance to the UK
economy. For each strategic industry,
the next Labour government will
establish a council (modelled on

the highly successful Automotive
Council) to oversee its future security
and growth. We will also encourage
private investment by removing new
plant and machinery from business
rate calculations.

National and local government spends
£200 billion a year in the private-

sector procurement. Labour will put
that spending power to good use to
upgrade our economy, create good
local jobs and reduce inequality. We will
require firms supplying national or local
government to meet the high standards
we should expect of all businesses:
paying their taxes, recognising trade
unions, respecting workers’ rights and
equal opportunities, protecting the
environment, providing training, and
paying suppliers on time. We will expect

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

suppliers to reduce boardroom pay
excesses by moving towards a 20:1 gap
between the highest and lowest paid.

We will appoint a Digital Ambassador
to liaise with technology companies
to promote Britain as an attractive
place for investment and provide
support for start-ups to scale up

to become world-class digital
businesses. Our Digital Ambassador
will help to ensure businesses are
ready to grow and prosper in the
digital age.

CHAPTER 01 CREATING AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL 15

TRANSFORMING
OUR FINANCIAL
SYSTEM

A decade after the devastating
international financial crisis, our
financial system is still holding
back too many of our small
businesses and local economies.

Labour will transform how our
financial system operates. Following
the successful example of Germany
and the Nordic countries, we will
establish a National Investment
Bank that will bring in private capital
finance to deliver £250 billion of
lending power.

This new public institution will
support a network of regional
development banks that, unlike giant
City of London firms, will be dedicated
to supporting inclusive growth in their
communities. The banks will deliver
the finance that our small businesses,
co-operatives and innovative projects
need across the whole country.

The National Investment Bank

will fill existing gaps in lending by
private banks, particularly to small
businesses, and by providing patient,
long-term finance to R&D-intensive
investments. It will also be given

the task of helping to deliver our
industrial strategy, by prioritising
spending in line with its objectives.

16

Labour will overhaul the regulation
of our financial system, putting in
place a firm ring-fence between
investment and retail banking that
will protect consumers. We will

take a new approach to the
publicly-owned RBS, and launch

a consultation on breaking up the
bank to create new local public
banks that are better matched

to their customers’ needs. And we will
extend existing Stamp Duty Reserve
Tax to cover a wider range of assets,
ensuring that the public gets a fairer
share of financial system profits.

Labour will change the law so that
banks can't close a branch where
there is a clear local need, putting
their customers first. Britain has

a successful international finance
industry, but we also need a strong,
safe and socially useful banking
system to meet the needs of our
own regional economies and
communities. We will commit to
creating a more diverse banking
system, backed up by legislation.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

A NEW DEAL FOR
BUSINESS

The majority of businesses play

by the rules: they pay their taxes
and their workers reasonably and
on time, and they operate with
respect for the environment and
local communities. That is why it is
vital that government ensures that
businesses doing the right thing
are rewarded rather than undercut
or outbid by those unscrupulous
few that cut corners, whether

on taxes, workers’ conditions,
environmental standards, or
consumer safety and protection.

But our business culture doesn't
always work like this. Scandals such as
the failure of BHS show how the long-
term growth of a company can be
sacrificed for the sake of a quick buck.

When shareholders are looking

for quick short-term returns, they
encourage companies to cut corners.
That means they look to cut wages,
instead of investing for the long term,
or they spend longer inventing new
tax avoidance schemes than they

do inventing new products.

By reforming the rules our companies
operate under, we can make sure
they stay focused on delivering
shared wealth. Labour will amend
company law so that directors owe a

CHAPTER 01 CREATING AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL

 

duty directly not only shareholders,
but to employees, customers, the
environment and the wider public,
and we will consult on bringing
forward appropriate legislation
within this Parliament.

Labour will amend the takeover
regime to ensure that businesses
identified as being ‘systemically
important’ have a clear plan in place
to protect workers and pensioners
when a company is taken over.
Labour will also legislate to reduce
pay inequality by introducing an
Excessive Pay Levy on companies
with staff on very high pay.

Our small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone
of our economy, providing 60

per cent of private-sector jobs.
Technological changes, like the
spread of digital manufacturing and

17

rapid communication, mean smaller,
faster businesses will be the future of
our economy.

Yet this Conservative Government
has taken small businesses for
granted. Labour is the party of small
businesses. We understand the
challenges our smaller businesses
face. In order to provide the support
many small businesses need,

a Labour government will:

+ Mandate the new National
Investment Bank, and regional
development banks in every
region, to identify where other
lenders fail to meet the needs
of SMEs and prioritise lending to
improve the funding gap.

Reinstate the lower small-business
corporation tax rate.

Introduce a package of reforms

to business rates - including
switching from RPI to CPI
indexation, exempting new
investment in plant and machinery
from valuations, and ensuring that
businesses have access to a proper
appeals process - while reviewing
the entire business rates system

in the longer run.

Scrap quarterly reporting for
businesses with a turnover
of under £85,000.

18

+ Declare war on late payments by:

+ Using government procurement
to ensure that anyone bidding
for a government contract pays
its own suppliers within 30 days.

+ Developing a version of the
Australian system of binding
arbitration and fines for
persistent late-payers for the
private and public sectors.

We will also bring forward legislation
to create a proper legal definition for
co-operative ownership. The National
Investment Bank and regional
development banks will be charged
with helping support our co-operative
sector. Labour will aim to double the
size of the co-operative sector in the
UK, putting it on a par with those in
leading economies like Germany or
the US.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

WIDENING
OWNERSHIP OF
OUR ECONOMY

Britain is a long-established
democracy. But the distribution
of ownership of the country’s
economy means that decisions
about our economy are often
made by a narrow elite. More
democratic ownership structures
would help our economy deliver
for the many and lead to a fairer
distribution of wealth.

In government, Labour would give
more people a stake - and a say

- in our economy by doubling the
size of the co-operative sector and
introducing a “right to own,” making
employees the buyer of first refusal
when the company they work for is
up for sale. We will act to ‘insource’
our public and local council services
as preferred providers.

Many basic goods and services have
been taken out of democratic control
through privatisation. This has often
led to higher prices and poorer
quality, as prices are raised to pay
out dividends. For example, water
bills have increased 40 per cent since
privatisation, and our private energy
providers overcharged customers by
£2 billion in 2015. In private hands,
Royal Mail has increased stamp and

CHAPTER 01 CREATING AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL

parcel charges, and failed to meet

its customer service obligations,
while its owners trade shares at
significant profit. The Conservative
Government's privatisation of Royal
Mail was a historic mistake, selling off
another national asset on the cheap.

Across the world, countries are
taking public utilities back into
public ownership. Labour will
learn from these experiences and
bring key utilities back into public
ownership to deliver lower prices,
more accountability and a more
sustainable economy. We will:

+ Bring private rail companies
back into public ownership
as their franchises expire.

+ Regain control of energy supply
networks through the alteration
of operator license conditions,
and transition to a publicly owned,
decentralised energy system.

+ Replace our dysfunctional water
system with a network of regional
publicly-owned water companies.

+ Reverse the privatisation of Royal
Mail at the earliest opportunity.

Public ownership will benefit
consumers, ensuring that their
interests are put first and that
there is democratic accountability
for the service.

19

SUSTAINABLE
ENERGY

Labour's energy policy is built
on three simple principles:

+ To ensure security of energy
supply and ‘keep the lights on’.

+ To ensure energy costs are
affordable for consumers and
businesses.

+ To ensure we meet our climate
change targets and transition
to a low-carbon economy.

The UK energy system is
outdated, expensive and polluting.
Privatisation has failed to

deliver an energy system that
delivers for people, businesses or
our environment.

One in ten households are in

fuel poverty, yet the Competition
Markets Authority found customers
are overcharged an enormous

£2 billion every year.

Labour understands that many
people don't have time to shop
around, they just want reliable
and affordable energy. So the next
Labour Government will:

+ Introduce an immediate
emergency price cap to ensure
that the average dual-fuel

20

household energy bill remains
below £1,000 per year, while we
transition to a fairer system

for bill payers.

* Take energy back into public
ownership to deliver renewable
energy, affordability for
consumers, and democratic
control. We will do this in the
following stages:

+ Regaining control of energy
supply networks through the
alteration of the National and
Regional Network Operator
license conditions.

Supporting the creation

of publicly owned, locally
accountable energy companies
and co-operatives to rival
existing private energy suppliers,
with at least one if every region.

Legislating to permit publicly
owned local companies to
purchase the regional grid
infrastructure, and to ensure
that national and regional grid
infrastructure is brought into
public ownership over time.

Labour will insulate four million
homes as an infrastructure priority to
help those who suffer in cold homes
each winter. This will cut emissions,
improve health, save on bills, and
reduce fuel poverty and winter deaths.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

Homeowners will be offered interest-
free loans to improve their property.
For renters, Labour will improve on
existing Landlord Energy Efficiency
regulations and re-establish the
Landlord Energy Saving Allowance

to encourage the uptake of
efficiency measures.

Labour will ban fracking because

it would lock us into an energy
infrastructure based on fossil fuels,
long after the point in 2030 when the
Committee on Climate Change says
gas in the UK must sharply decline.

Emerging technologies such as
carbon capture and storage will help
to smooth the transition to cleaner
fuels and to protect existing jobs

as part of the future energy mix. To
safeguard the offshore oil and gas
industry, we will provide a strategy

CHAPTER 01 CREATING AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL

focused on protecting vital North
Sea assets, and the jobs and skills
that depend on them.

We are committed to renewable
energy projects, including tidal
lagoons, which can help create
manufacturing and energy jobs
as well as contributing to climate-
change commitments.

The UK has the world’s oldest nuclear
industry, and nuclear will continue to
be part of the UK energy supply. We
will support further nuclear projects
and protect nuclear workers’ jobs

and pensions. There are considerable
opportunities for nuclear power and
decommissioning both internationally
and domestically.

Building a clean economy of the
future is the most important thing
we must do for our children,

21

our grandchildren and future
generations. Yet recent years have
seen a failure to progress towards
our targets. A Labour government
will put us back on track to meet the
targets in the Climate Change Act
and the Paris Agreement.

The low-carbon economy is one
of the UK's fastest-growing sectors,
creating jobs and providing
investment across each region.

It employed an estimated 447,000
employees in the UK in 2015 and
saw over £77 billion in turnover.
With backing from a Labour
government, these sectors can
secure crucial shares of global
export markets.

Currently, the UK buys and sells
energy tariff free from Europe, an
arrangement which saves families
and businesses money, and helps
balance the power grid. As part
of the Brexit negotiations, Labour
will prioritise maintaining access
to the internal energy market.
Labour will also retain access to
Euratom, to allow continued trade
of fissile material, with access and
collaboration over research vital
to our nuclear industry.

CHAPTER 02

NEGOTIATING BREXIT

 

 

NEGOTIATING
BREXIT

Labour accepts the referendum
result and a Labour government
will put the national interest first.
We will prioritise jobs and living
standards, build a close new
relationship with the EU, protect
workers’ rights and environmental
standards, provide certainty

to EU nationals and give

a meaningful role to Parliament
throughout negotiations.

We will end Theresa May's reckless
approach to Brexit, and seek to unite
the country around a Brexit deal that

works for every community in Britain.

We will scrap the Conservatives’
Brexit White Paper and replace it
with fresh negotiating priorities that
have a strong emphasis on retaining
the benefits of the Single Market
and the Customs Union - which

are essential for maintaining
industries, jobs and businesses in
Britain. Labour will always put jobs
and the economy first.

A Labour government will
immediately guarantee existing
rights for all EU nationals living in
Britain and secure reciprocal rights
for UK citizens who have chosen
to make their lives in EU countries.
EU nationals do not just contribute

24

to our society: they are part of our
society. And they should not be used
as bargaining chips.

It is shameful that the Prime

Minister rejected repeated attempts
by Labour to resolve this issue before
Article 50 was triggered. As a result
three million EU nationals have
suffered unnecessary uncertainty,

as have the 1.2 million UK citizens
living in the EU.

A Conservative Brexit will weaken
workers’ rights, deregulate the
economy, slash corporate taxes,
sideline Parliament and democratic
accountability, and cut Britain off
from our closest allies and most
important trading partners.

Labour recognises that leaving the
EU with ‘no deal’ is the worst possible
deal for Britain and that it would do
damage to our economy and trade.
We will reject ‘no deal’ as a viable
option and if needs be negotiate
transitional arrangements to avoid

a ‘cliff-edge’ for the UK economy.

The issues that affect our continent
now will continue to do so in the
future - and Labour will continue

to work constructively with the

EU and other European nations

on issues such as climate change,
refugee crises and counter-terrorism.
We will build a close co-operative
future relationship with the EU,

not as members but as partners.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

A Labour government will ensure
that the UK maintains our leading
research role by seeking to stay part
of Horizon 2020 and its successor
programmes and by welcoming
research staff to the UK. We will
seek to maintain membership of

(or equivalent relationships with)
European organisations which offer
benefits to the UK such as Euratom
and the European Medicines Agency.
We will seek to ensure that Britain
remains part of the Erasmus scheme
so that British students have the
same educational opportunities after
we leave the EU.

The EU is the UK's single largest
trading partner in agricultural
produce, with the vast majority

of British exports being sold to
European markets. A Labour
government will end the uncertainty
for our farmers and food producers
by securing continued EU market

CHAPTER 02 NEGOTIATING BREXIT

access allowing British farmers and
food producers to continue to sell
their products on the Continent.

Labour will also protect our farmers
and rural economy by ensuring
Britain continues to set the highest
standards in food quality and welfare.
We will not allow Brexit to be used as
an excuse to undercut our farmers
and flood Britain's food chain with
cheap and inferior produce.

We will drop the Conservatives’
Great Repeal Bill, replacing it

with an EU Rights and Protections
Bill that will ensure there is no
detrimental change to workers’
rights, equality law, consumer
rights or environmental protections
as a result of Brexit.

Throughout the Brexit process,

we will make sure that all EU-derived
laws that are of benefit - including
workplace laws, consumer rights
and environmental protections - are

25

 

fully protected without qualifications,
limitations or sunset clauses. We will
work with trade unions, businesses
and stakeholders to ensure there

is a consensus on this vital issue.

A Labour approach to Brexit will
ensure there can be no rolling back
of key rights and protections and
that the UK does not lag behind
Europe in workplace protections and
environmental standards in future.

The EU has had a huge impact in
securing workplace protections and
environmental safeguards. But we
all know that for many Brexiteers

in the Tory Party, this was why

they wanted to Leave - to tear up
regulations and weaken hard-fought
rights and protections.

A Labour government will never
consider these rights a burden
or accept the weakening of
workers’ rights, consumer rights
or environmental protections.

We will introduce legislation to
ensure there are no gaps in national
security and criminal justice
arrangements as a result of Brexit.

Labour recognises the vital role

that cross-border agencies such as
Eurojust and Europol have played

in making Britain safer and that
European Arrest Warrants have been
invaluable. A Labour government will
seek to retain membership of these
agencies and continue European
Arrest Warrant arrangements.

Labour will seek a Brexit deal that
delivers for all regions and nations
of the UK. We will introduce a
‘presumption of devolution’ where
devolved powers transferred

from the EU will go straight to the
relevant region or nation. For many
people and for much of our country,
power can feel just as remote and
unaccountable in Westminster as

it does in Brussels. So a Labour
government will seek to put powers
as close to communities as possible.

We will ensure there is no drop
in EU Structural Funding as a result
of Brexit until the end of the current

EU funding round in 2019/20. As part

of Labour's plans to rebalance and
rebuild the economy, we will ensure
that no region or nation of the UK
is affected by the withdrawal of EU
funding for the remainder of this

Parliament. This will also apply to the

funding of peace and reconciliation
projects in Northern Ireland.

We will also improve engagement
and dialogue with the devolved
administrations and seek to ensure
the final Brexit deal addresses
specific concerns. In particular

Labour will ensure there is no return

to a hard border between Northern
Ireland and the Republic of Ireland
and that there is no change in the
status or sovereignty of Gibraltar.
We will also protect Gibraltar’s
economy and ensure that its

CHAPTER 02 NEGOTIATING BREXIT

government can continue to
create jobs and prosperity in
the years to come.

Where Theresa May wants to shut
down scrutiny and challenge, Labour
will welcome it. We will work with
Parliament, not against it.

On an issue of this importance

the Government can't hide from

the public or Parliament.

A Labour approach to Brexit also
means legislating to guarantee that
Parliament has a truly meaningful
vote on the final Brexit deal.

27

IMMIGRATION

Labour offers fair rules and
reasonable management of
migration. In trade negotiations
our priorities favour growth,
jobs and prosperity. We make no
apologies for putting these aims

before bogus immigration targets.

Freedom of movement will

end when we leave the European
Union. Britain’s immigration system
will change, but Labour will not
scapegoat migrants nor blame
them for economic failures.

Labour will develop and implement
fair immigration rules. We will not
discriminate between people of
different races or creeds. We will
end indefinite detentions and
distinguish between migrant labour
and family attachment and will
continue to support the work of
the Forced Marriage Unit. We will
replace income thresholds with a
prohibition on recourse to public
funds. New rules will be equally
informed by negotiations with the
EU and other partners, including
the Commonwealth.

Whatever our trade arrangements,
we will need new migration
management systems, transparent
and fair to everybody. Working with
businesses, trade unions, devolved
governments and others to identify
specific labour and skill shortages.

28

Working together we will institute a
new system which is based on our
economic needs, balancing controls
and existing entitlements. This may
include employer sponsorship, work
permits, visa regulations or a tailored
mix of all these which works for the
many, not the few.

Labour will protect those already
working here, whatever their
ethnicity. Our National Education
Service will raise the level of skills
and training. We will take decisive
actions to end the exploitation of
migrant labour undercutting
workers’ pay and conditions.

Labour will crack down on
unscrupulous employers. We will
stop overseas-only recruitment
practices, strengthen safety-at-
work inspections and increase
prosecutions of employers evading
the minimum wage.

Working with trade unions, we
will end workplace exploitation.

Labour values the economic and
social contributions of immigrants.
Both public and private sector
employers depend on immigrants.
We will not denigrate those workers.
We value their contributions,
including their tax contributions.

For areas where immigration

has placed a strain on public services
we will reinstate the Migrant Impact
Fund and boost

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

it with a contributory element from
the investments required for High
Net Worth Individual Visas. Labour
will restore the rights of migrant
domestic workers, and end this form
of modern slavery.

Labour will ease the underlying
pressures in any areas struggling to
cope with seven years of austerity
by our programme of investments.
We will not cut public services and
pretend the cuts are a consequence
of immigration.

Refugees are not migrants. They

have been forced from their homes,
by war, famine or other disasters.
Unlike the Tories, we will uphold the
proud British tradition of honouring
the spirit of international law and

our moral obligations by taking our
fair share of refugees. The current
arrangements for housing and
dispersing refugees are not fit for
purpose. They are not fair to refugees
or to our communities. We will review
these arrangements.

Labour welcomes international
students who benefit and strengthen
our education sector, generating
more than £25 billion for the British
economy and significantly boosting
regional jobs and local businesses.
They are not permanent residents
and we will not include them in
immigration numbers, but we will
crack down on fake colleges.

CHAPTER 02 NEGOTIATING BREXIT 29

INTERNATIONAL
TRADE

Labour is pro-trade and
pro-investment. The UK’s future
prosperity depends on minimising
tariff and non-tariff barriers that
prevent us from exporting and
creating the jobs and economic
growth we need.

A Labour government will work

with devolved administrations to
bring forward an integrated trade
and industrial strategy that boosts
exports, investment and decent jobs
in Britain.

Labour will set out our priorities in
an International Trade White Paper
to lead a national debate on the
future of Britain's trade policy. We
will ensure proper transparency and
parliamentary scrutiny of all future
trade and investment deals.

The EU accounts for 44 per cent

of our current exports and will
continue to be a priority trading
partner. As our trading relationship
with the EU changes it is vital that
we retain unrestricted access for
our goods and services.

Through our Just Trading initiative
launched in 2016, Labour will work
with global trading partners to
develop ‘best-in-class’ free trade and
investment agreements that remove
trade barriers and promote skilled

30

jobs and high standards.

We will ensure all future trade
deals safeguard the right to
regulate in the public interest
and to protect public services.

Labour is committed to the
rules-based international

trading system of the World Trade
Organisation (WTO). We will rejoin
the Government Procurement
Agreement, whilst safeguarding

the capacity for public bodies to
make procurement decisions in
keeping with public policy objectives.

Labour will build human rights

and social justice into trade policy.
We will ensure that trade agreements
cannot undermine human rights and
labour standards, and that UK Export
Finance support is not available to
companies engaged in bribery or
corrupt practices.

We will work with other WTO
members to end the dumping

of state-subsidised goods on

our markets. The Conservatives
consistently blocked EU efforts to
respond to such dumping with the
duties needed to defend the British
steel industry. Labour will develop
the full range of trade remedies
necessary to support key sectors
affected by these unfair practices.

Labour will champion the export
interests of SMEs, ensuring all

new trade agreements include a
commitment to support their market
access needs. We will develop an

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

export incentive scheme for SMEs
based on international best practice,
and we will ring-fence Tradeshow
Access Programme grants to help
SMEs reach new customers around
the world.

Labour will use the full range of
export credit, finance, insurance
and trade promotion tools to boost
British exports and support priority
industrial sectors.

We will create a network of regional
trade and investment champions
to promote the export and
investment interests of businesses
across the country, and we will
include regional representation on
overseas trade missions.

Labour is committed to growing
the digital economy and ensuring

that trade agreements do not impede

cross-border data flows, whilst
maintaining strong data protection
rules to protect personal privacy.

CHAPTER 02 NEGOTIATING BREXIT

As part of our commitment to a
low-carbon future, we will actively
support international negotiations
towards an Environmental Goods
Agreement at the WTO. Labour
will use trade negotiations to
boost market access for British
environmental goods and services,
alongside support for investment
into new green technologies and
innovative low-carbon products.

Labour will develop capital
investment schemes and other
incentives to encourage investment
into the UK, especially into target
areas identified by the industrial
strategy. We will champion the UK
as a safe investment environment.

Labour will review our historic
investment treaties with other
countries, ensuring they are fit for
purpose for the 21st century. Labour
opposes parallel investor-state
dispute systems for multinational
corporations and we will open a
dialogue with trading partners

on alternative options that

provide investor protection whilst
guaranteeing equality before the law.

TOWARDS
A NATIONAL
EDUCATION SERVICE

 

TOWARDS When the 1945 Labour government

established the NHS, it created one

A NATI Oo NAL of the central institutions of fairness

of the 20th century. The NES will do

EDUCATION the same for the 21st, giving people

confidence and hope by making
SE RVI CE education a right, not a privilege,
—_ and building bridges where the

wo. Conservatives build barriers.
Education is what empowers us

all to realise our full potential.
When it fails, it isn’t just the
individual that is held back,

but all of us. When we invest in
people to develop their skills and
capabilities, we all benefit from a
stronger economy and society.

At a time when working lives and
the skills our economy needs are
changing rapidly, governments have
the responsibility to make lifelong
learning a reality by giving everyone
the opportunity to access education
throughout their lives.

To meet this responsibility, Labour
will create a unified National
Education Service (NES) for England
to move towards cradle-to-grave
learning that is free at the point

of use. The NES will be built on the
principle that ‘Every Child - and Adult
- Matters’ and will incorporate all
forms of education, from early

years through to adult education.

34 FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

EARLY YEARS

Currently, there is a gap between
the end of maternity leave and the
beginning of full-time schooling.
This gap can make it difficult for
parents, particularly women,

to return to work, unless they
have access to informal childcare
support. There is also extensive
evidence that early years
education has a major impact

on child development, and that
time in a formal education setting
for young children can improve
performance at GCSE and beyond.

Labour would seek to roll out
educational provision for early
years children as part of a National
Education Service that is truly
cradle-to-grave.

Labour introduced free childcare
hours for parents, which were fully
funded and resourced.

CHAPTER 03 TOWARDS A NATIONAL EDUCATION SERVICE

Under the Conservatives, the free
hours entitlement is chronically
under-funded, with provision patchy
and hard to navigate. Many providers
now simply refuse to participate in
the scheme. The result is that many
parents aren't even getting the

hours they're entitled to.

Labour would:

1. Overhaul the existing childcare
system in which subsidies are
given directly to parents who often
struggle to use them, and transition
to a system of high-quality childcare
places in mixed environments with
direct government subsidy.

2. Maintain current commitments
on free hours and make significant
capital investment during our
first two years of government,
to ensure that the places exist
to meet demand.

3. Phase in subsidised provision
on top of free-hour entitlements,
to ensure that everyone has access
to affordable childcare, no matter
their working pattern.

4. Transition to a qualified,
graduate-led workforce, by
increasing staff wages and enhancing
training opportunities. This will
benefit staff, who are among our
worst-paid workers,
and improve child development.

35

5. Extend the 30 free hours to all two-
year-olds, and move towards making
some childcare available for one-
year-olds and extending maternity
pay to 12 months.

Sure Start, and the support it gives
to vulnerable and hard-to-reach
parents, was one of the great
achievements of the previous
Labour government, but under
the Conservatives 1,200 Sure Start
centres have been lost. Labour will
halt the closures and increase the
amount of money available for
Sure Start.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

SCHOOLS

Conservative cuts are starving
schools of the funding they

need to deliver a first class
education. Crippling underfunding
is driving up class sizes and
forcing schools to cut corners.

A narrow curriculum and a culture
of assessment is driving away
teachers, creating a recruitment
and retention crisis.

Labour will not waste money on
inefficient free schools and the
Conservatives’ grammar schools
vanity project. Labour does not want
a return to secondary moderns. We
will also oppose any attempt to force
schools to become academies.

Labour's schools policy will be built
on the following four foundations:

CHAPTER 03 TOWARDS A NATIONAL EDUCATION SERVICE

1. Investment - we will make sure
schools are properly resourced
by reversing the Conservatives’ cuts
and ensuring that all schools have
the resources they need. We will
introduce a fairer funding formula
that leaves no school worse off,
while redressing the historical
underfunding of certain schools.
Labour will also invest in new school
buildings, including the phased
removal of asbestos from existing
schools.

2. Quality - we will drive up standards
across the board, learning from
examples of best practice, such as
Labour's London Challenge,
to encourage co-operation and
strong leadership across schools. We
and trust in teachers and support
staff professionalism to refocus their
workload on what happens in the
classroom.

37

3. Accountability - Labour will ensure
that all schools are democratically
accountable, including appropriate
controls to see that they serve
the public interest and their local
communities. We will require
joined-up admissions policies across
local schools to enable councils to
fulfil their responsibilities on child
places,
to simplify the admissions process
for parents and to ensure that no
child slips through the net.

4. Inclusion - Every child is unique, and
a Labour-led education
system will enable each to find
their learning path through
a wide choice of courses and
qualifications. We will invest in
measures to close the attainment
gap between children from different
backgrounds.

To give all children the best start in
life, we will reduce class sizes to less
than 30 for all five-, six-, and seven-
year-olds, and seek to extend that
as resources allow.

To aid attainment, we will introduce
free school meals for all primary
school children, paid for by removing
the VAT exemption on private

school fees.

We will abandon plans to reintroduce
baseline assessments and launch

a commission to look into curriculum
and assessment, starting by
reviewing Key Stage 1 and 2 SATs.
The world’s most successful

38

education systems use more
continuous assessment, which
avoids ‘teaching for the test’.

We will tackle the teacher recruitment
and retention crisis by ending

the public-sector pay cap, giving
teachers more direct involvement in
the curriculum, and tackling rising
workloads by reducing monitoring
and bureaucracy.

We will also consult on introducing
teacher sabbaticals and placements
with industry to encourage
interaction between education

and industry and introduce broad
experiences into the classroom.

We will reintroduce the Schools
Support Staff Negotiating Body and
national pay settlements for teachers.

We will put £150 million back into
supporting our children in schools
by scrapping the Conservatives’
nonsensical plans for schools

to pay the apprenticeship levy.

We will extend schools-based
counselling to all schools to improve
children’s mental health, at a cost
of £90 million per year.

And we will deliver a strategy for
children with special educational
needs and disabilities (SEND) based
on inclusivity, and embed SEND
more substantially into training for
teachers and non-teaching staff, so
that staff, children and their parents
are properly supported.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

SKILLS

At a time when technology is
changing demand for different kinds
of skills, and evolving patterns of
work mean that people are more
likely to pursue several careers
during their working lives, it is
crucial that our education system
enables people to upskill and retrain
over their lifetimes. As part of our
dynamic industrial strategy, lifelong
training will deliver productivity and
growth to the whole economy while
transforming the lives of individuals
and communities.

To ensure that we deliver for every
part of the UK, we will devolve
responsibility for skills, wherever there
is an appetite, to city regions

or devolved administrations.

Further and Adult Education

Despite claiming to be committed to
delivering high-quality training, the
Conservatives have ruthlessly cut
funding for FE colleges - our main
provider of adult and vocational
education - and reduced entitlements
for adult learners. This has led to
diminishing numbers of courses and
students, and plunged the sector

into crisis.

Labour would introduce free, lifelong
education in Further Education (FE)
colleges, enabling everyone to upskill
or retrain at any point in life.

CHAPTER 03 TOWARDS A NATIONAL EDUCATION SERVICE

 

Our skills and training sector

has been held back by repeated
reorganisation, which deprives
providers, learners and employers
of the consistency they need to
assess quality. Labour would
abandon Conservative plans to once
again reinvent the wheel by building
new technical colleges, redirecting
the money to increase teacher
numbers in the FE sector.

We share the broad aims of the
Sainsbury Review but would ensure
vocational routes incorporate the
service sector as well as traditional
manufacturing, working in tandem
with our broad industrial strategy
to deliver for the whole economy.

We will improve careers advice

and open up a range of routes
through, and back into, education,
striking a balance between classroom
and on-the-job training, to ensure
students gain both technical and

soft skills.

To implement the Sainsbury
recommendations, we would correct
historic neglect of the FE sector by

39

giving the sector the investment - in
teachers and facilities - it deserves to
become a world-leading provider of
adult and vocational education.

More specifically, we would:

+ Bring funding for 16 to18-year-olds
in line with Key Stage 4 baselines,
while ensuring that the budget is
distributed fairly between colleges
and school sixth forms

+ Restore the Education
Maintenance Allowance for
16 to 18-year-olds from lower
and middle income backgrounds

+ Replace Advanced Learner Loans
and upfront course fees with direct
funding, making FE courses free at
the point of use, including English
for Speakers of Other Languages
(ESOL) courses.

+ Drive up quality and consistency in
the FE sector by:

+ Encouraging co-operation and
leadership across colleges
and sixth forms, improving
curriculum breadth and quality

+ Setting a target, backed up by
funding, for all FE teaching staff
to have a teaching qualification
within five years.

+ In recognition of the role played by
private-sector providers, we would
extend support for training to
teachers in the private sector

40

+ Increase capital investment to
equip colleges to deliver T-levels
and an official pre-apprenticeship
trainee programme.

Apprenticeships

Employer-led training is the most
effective way of meeting our
growing skills gap. Labour supports
the apprenticeship levy, but will
take steps to ensure that every
apprenticeship is of a high quality.

Labour will:

+ Maintain the apprenticeship levy
while taking measures to ensure
high quality by requiring the
Institute for Apprenticeships and
Technical Education to report on
an annual basis to the Secretary
of State on quality outcomes of
completed apprenticeships to
ensure they deliver skilled workers
for employers and real jobs for
apprentices at the end of their
training. And we will work with
the devolved administrations to
improve the operation of the levy

+ Set a target to double the number
of completed apprenticeships at
NVQ level 3 by 2022

* Give employers more flexibility in
how the levy is deployed, including
allowing the levy to be used for
pre-apprenticeship programmes

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

* Guarantee trade union
representation in the governance
structures of the Institute of
Apprenticeships

Protect the £440 million funding
for apprenticeships for small-and
medium-sized employers who
don't pay the levy

Set targets to increase
apprenticeships for people with
disabilities, care leavers and
veterans, and ensure broad
representation of women, BAME,
LGBT and people with disabilities
in all kinds of apprenticeships

Consult on introducing incentives
for large employers to over-train
numbers of apprentices to fill skills
gaps in the supply chain and the
wider sector

Reverse cuts to Unionlearn

Set up a commission on Lifelong
Learning tasked with integrating
further and higher education.

42

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

Labour believes education should
be free, and we will restore this
principle. No one should be put off
educating themselves for lack of
money or through fear of debt.

There is a real fear that students

are being priced out of university
education. Last year saw the steepest
fall in university applications for

30 years.

Since the Conservatives came to
power, university tuition fees have
been trebled to over £9,000 a year,
and maintenance grants have been
abolished and replaced with loans.

The average student now graduates
from university, and starts their
working life, with debts of £44,000.

Labour will reintroduce maintenance
grants for university students, and we
will abolish university tuition fees.

University tuition is free in many
northern European countries, and
under a Labour government it will
be free here too.

CHAPTER 04

A FAIR DEAL
AT WORK

 

 

 

A FAIR DEAL
AT WORK

Work should provide people
with security and fulfilment.
But for too many people work
is insecure and does not make
ends meet.

The Conservatives boast about the
recovery of employment, but our
labour market is failing. Real-terms
pay is still lower than before the
crash, and jobs are increasingly low
skilled and insecure.

A Labour government will invest in

enforcement through a new Ministry
of Labour, and empower workers and

their trade unions - because we are
stronger when we stand together.

46

So we will review the rules on union
recognition so that more workers
have the security of a union.

At the same time as strengthening
workers’ rights, we will make work
more fulfilling by using public
investment to upgrade our economy
and create high-quality jobs. While
the Conservatives stand back and
allow insecure work to spread,
Labour will act to guarantee good
jobs and businesses.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

RIGHTS AT WORK

The next Labour government will
bring in a 20-point plan for security
and equality at work:

1. Give all workers equal rights from
day one, whether part-time or
full-time, temporary or permanent
- so that working conditions are
not driven down.

2. Ban zero hours contracts - so that
every worker gets a guaranteed
number of hours each week.

3. Legislate to ensure that any
employer wishing to recruit labour
from abroad does not undercut
workers at home - because
it causes divisions when one
workforce is used against another.

4. Repeal the Trade Union Act
and roll out sectoral collective
bargaining - because the most
effective way to maintain good
rights at work is collectively
through a union.

5. Guarantee trade unions a right
to access workplaces - so that
unions can speak to members and
potential members.

6. Propose four new public holidays
- bringing our country together
to mark our four national patron
saints’ days. These will be
additional to statutory holiday

entitlement so that workers
in Britain get the same proper
breaks as in other countries.

Raise the Minimum Wage to the
level of the Living Wage (expected
to be at least £10 per hour by
2020) - for all workers aged 18

or over, so that work pays.

End the Public Sector Pay Cap -
because public sector workers
deserve a pay rise after years of
falling wages.

Amend the takeover code to
ensure every takeover proposal
has a clear plan in place to
protect workers and pensioners -
because workers shouldn't suffer
when a company is sold.

Roll out maximum pay ratios
of 20:1 in the public sector and
in companies bidding for public
contracts - because it cannot
be right that wages at the top
keep rising while everyone
else's stagnates.

 

47

11. Ban unpaid internships - because
it’s not fair for some to get a leg
up when others can't afford to.

12. Enforce all workers’ rights to trade
union representation at work -
so that all workers can be
supported when negotiating
with their employer.

13. Abolish employment tribunal
fees - so that people have
access to justice.

14. Double paid paternity leave to
four weeks and increase paternity
pay - because fathers are parents
too and deserve to spend more
time with their new babies.

15. Strengthen protections for
women against unfair redundancy
- because no one should be
penalised for having children.

16. Hold a public inquiry into
blacklisting - to ensure that
blacklisting truly becomes and
remains a thing of the past.

17. Give equalities reps statutory
rights - so they have time
to protect workers from
discrimination.

18. Reinstate protection against
third party harassment - because
everyone deserves to be safe
at work.

19. Use public spending power to
drive up standards, including

48

only awarding public contracts to
companies which recognise trade
unions.

20. Introduce a civil enforcement
system to ensure compliance
with gender pay auditing - so
that all workers have fair access
to employment and promotion
opportunities and are treated
fairly at work.

A Labour government will ensure
Britain abides by the global Labour
standards of the ILO conventions.

All workers should be able to work
in a safe environment and return to
their families at the end of the day.
Labour will enforce regulations that
save lives.

As well as legislating against zero
hours contracts, there are many
more workers on short hours
contracts (some only guaranteed

a few hours per week), but who
regularly work far more. We will
strengthen the law so that those who
work regular hours for more than 12
weeks will have a right to a regular
contract, reflecting those hours.

We will also scrap the changes
brought in by the Conservatives in
2014 to TUPE, which weakened the
protections for workers transferring
between contractors, and we will
abolish the loophole to the agency
workers regulations known as the
Swedish derogation.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

 

We will consult with employers

and trade unions on legislating for
statutory bereavement leave, for time
off work after the loss of close family
members. We will also consult on
toughening the law against assaulting
workers who have to enforce laws
such as age-related sales or ticketing
arrangements, and who face regular
abuse.

Labour will maintain the ACAS Early
Conciliation System to try to solve
workplace issues efficiently, and we
will protect the current compromise
on Sunday trading hours.

Labour will also legislate to permit
secure online and workplace balloting
for industrial action votes and
internal union elections.

Workers in Britain are among

the easiest and cheapest to

make redundant, meaning when
multinational companies are taking
decisions to downsize that British
workers are at a disadvantage. We
will consult with trade unions and
industry on reviewing redundancy
arrangements to bring workers in
Britain more into line with their
European counterparts.

Stagnating incomes have forced
many to take on more debt. Labour
will introduce a version of Scotland's
Debt Arrangement Scheme to give
breathing space to households
struggling with high debts.

50 FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

SELF-EMPLOYED
WORKERS

Self-employment can bring many
benefits, freedoms and flexibilities
to people - and is a vital and often
entrepreneurial sector of our
economy.

But there is also mounting evidence
that workers are being forced into
self-employment by unscrupulous
employers to avoid costs and their
duties to workers. Labour will clamp
down on bogus self-employment by:

+ Shifting the burden of proof, so
that the law assumes a worker is
an employee unless the employer
can prove otherwise.

Imposing punitive fines on
employers not meeting their
responsibilities, helping to deter
others from doing the same.

Involving trade unions in
enforcement, e.g. by giving them
a seat on the executive board of
the new Ministry of Labour.

Giving the Ministry of Labour
the resources to enforce all
workers’ rights.

Banning payroll companies,
sometimes known as umbrella
companies, which create a false
structure to limit employers’ tax
liabilities and limit workers’ rights.

(CHAPTER 04 A FAIR DEAL AT WORK

* Giving employment agencies and
end-users joint responsibility for
ensuring that the rights of agency
workers are enforced.

+ Rolling out sectoral collective
bargaining and strengthening
trade union rights, because
empowering people to claim
their own rights in the workplace
is the most effective means of
enforcement.

We would also extend the rights of
employees to all workers, including
shared parental pay, making a
substantial and immediate difference
to the quality of life of people in
insecure work. But there are real
concerns that rapid changes to the
world of work are rendering existing
employment categories outdated.

Labour recognises that the law
often struggles to keep up with

the ever-changing new forms of
employment and work, so we will
set up a dedicated commission

to modernise the law around
employment status. New statutory
definitions of employment status
would reduce the need for litigation
and improve compliance.

The commission will be led by
legal and academic experts with
representation from industry and
trade unions.

CHAPTER 05

SOCIAL SECURITY

 

 

SOCIAL SECURITY

After seven years of rising poverty
and inequality, Labour will rebuild
and transform our social security
system. Like the NHS, our social
security system is there for all of
us in our time of need, providing
security and dignity in retirement
and the basics in life should we
become sick or disabled, or fall

on hard times.

DIGNITY FOR
PENSIONERS

Labour will always be on the side
of pensioners and help ensure
security and dignity for older
people in retirement.

As the Conservatives abandon

their commitments to older people,
Labour will guarantee the state
pension ‘triple lock’ throughout the
next Parliament. It will rise by at least
2.5 per cent a year or be increased to
keep pace with inflation or earnings,
whichever is higher.

The Winter Fuel Allowance and free
bus passes will also be guaranteed as
universal benefits.

We will protect the pensions of UK
citizens living overseas in the EU or
further afield.

54

Over 2.5 million women born in
the 1950s have had their state
pension age changed without fair
notification. These women deserve
both recognition for the injustice
they have suffered and some kind
of compensation for their losses.

Alongside our commitment to
extend Pension Credit to hundreds
of thousands of the most vulnerable
women, Labour is exploring options
for further transitional protections,
to ensure that all these women have
security and dignity in older age.

This must never happen again.
Labour will legislate so that accrued
rights to the basic state pension
cannot be changed, but future
benefits can.

The pension age is due to rise to

66 by the end of 2020. Labour

rejects the Conservatives’ proposal to
increase the state pension age even
further. We will commission a new
review of the pension age, specifically
tasked with developing a flexible
retirement policy to reflect both

the contributions made by people,
the wide variations in life expectancy,
and the arduous conditions of

some work.

We'll restore confidence in the
workplace pension system and
put people rather than profit at
its centre. Labour will end rip-off

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

hidden fees and charges, and enable
the development of large efficient
pensions funds, which will mean
more cash for scheme members
and lower costs for employers.

A Labour government will commit
to an immediate review of the
mineworkers’ pension scheme and
British Coal superannuation scheme
surplus, sharing arrangements
between government and scheme
beneficiaries.

CHAPTER 05 SOCIAL SECURITY 55

DIGNITY FOR
THOSE WHO
CANNOT WORK

Poverty in Britain is rising due to
the Conservatives’ attempts to
balance the books on the backs
of the poorest. They have slashed
social security over the last seven
years, leaving more people in
poverty, subject to a punitive
sanctions regime, and reliant

on food banks.

Labour will act immediately to end the
worst excesses of the Conservative
government's changes. We will:

+ Scrap the punitive sanctions regime
* Scrap the Bedroom Tax

+ Reinstate Housing Benefit
for under-21s

* Scrap cuts to Bereavement Support
Payment.

The cuts to work allowances in
Universal Credit (UC), and the decision
to limit tax credit and UC payments

to the first two children in a family,
are an attack on low-income families
and will increase child poverty. Labour
will reform and redesign UC, ending
six-week delays in payment and the
‘rape clause’.

With nearly four million children
currently living in poverty, the majority

56

in working families, we will
commit to tackle child poverty
with a new Child Poverty Strategy.

The Tories have completely failed on
their promise of making work pay and
on tackling the barriers to work faced
by people with disabilities.

Labour supports a social model of
disability. People may have a condition
or an impairment but they are disabled
by society. We need to remove

the barriers in society that restrict
opportunities and choices

for people with disabilities.

We will build on the previous Labour
government's commitment to people
with disabilities in 2009 as signatories
to the UN Convention on the Rights
of Persons with Disabilities, and
incorporate it into UK law.

Labour will repeal the following cuts in
social security support to people with
disabilities through a new Social Security
Bill published in our first year in office.
We will:

+ Increase Employment and Support
Allowance (ESA) by £30 per week
for those in the work-related activity
group, and repeal cuts in the UC
limited capacity for work element.

+ Increase Carer’s Allowance by £11 to
the level of Jobseekers’ Allowance.

+ Implement the court decision on
Personal Independence Payment
(PIP) so that there is real parity of

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

esteem between those with physical
and mental-health conditions.

+ Scrap the Work Capability and
Personal Independence Payment
assessments and replace them with
a personalised, holistic assessment
process that provides each individual
with a tailored plan, building on their
strengths and addressing barriers.
Labour will end the privatisation of
assessments.

+ End the pointless stress of
reassessments for people with
severe long-term conditions.

* Commission a report into expanding
the Access to Work programme.

CHAPTER 05 SOCIAL SECURITY

 

We will change the culture of the
social security system, from one that
demonises people not in work to one
that is supportive and enabling.

As well as scrapping the Conservatives’
punitive sanctions regime, we will
change how Jobcentre Plus staff are
performance-managed.

Labour will strengthen access to justice
for people with disabilities by enhancing
the 2010 Equality Act, enabling
discrimination at work to be challenged.
We will ensure that under the Istanbul
Convention, disability hate crime and
violence against women with disabilities
is reported annually, with national
actions plans to address these issues.

CHAPTER 06

SECURE HOMES
FOR ALL

 

 

SECURE HOMES
FOR ALL

Home is at the heart of all of our
lives. It’s the foundation on which
we raise our families, the bedrock
for our dreams and aspirations.
But for too many people, the
housing pressures they face are
getting worse not better. Britain
has a housing crisis - a crisis of
supply and a crisis of affordability.

After seven years of failure, the
Conservatives have no plan to

fix the housing crisis. Since 2010,
housebuilding has fallen to its lowest
level since the 1920s, rough sleeping
has risen every year, rents have risen
faster than incomes, there are almost
200,000 fewer home-owners, and
new affordable housebuilding

is at a 24-year low.

It doesn't have to be like this. Labour
will invest to build over a million
new homes. By the end of the next
Parliament we will be building at
least 100,000 council and housing
association homes a year for
genuinely affordable rent or sale.

Labour will establish a new
Department for Housing to focus

on tackling the crisis and to ensure
housing is about homes for the many,
not investment opportunities for the
few. Labour's new housing ministry
will be tasked with improving the
number, standards and affordability

60

of homes. We will overhaul the
Homes and Communities Agency

to be Labour's housing delivery body,
and give councils new powers to build
the homes local communities need.

We will prioritise brownfield sites and
protect the green belt. We will start
work on a new generation of New
Towns to build the homes we need
and avoid urban sprawl.

We will make the building of new
homes, including council homes,
a priority through our National
Transformation Fund, as part of
a joined-up industrial and skills
strategy that ensures a vibrant
construction sector with a skilled
workforce and rights at work.

Labour will not only build more,

we will build better. We will insulate
more homes to help people manage
the cost of energy bills, to reduce
preventable winter deaths, and to
meet our climate change targets.
We will consult on new rules on
minimum space standards to prevent
‘rabbit hutch’ properties and on new
modern standards for building ‘zero
carbon homes’.

We will ensure that local plans
address the need for older people’s
housing, ensuring that choice and
downsizing options are readily
available.

We will keep the Land Registry in public
hands, where it belongs, and make
ownership of land more transparent.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

HOME
OWNERSHIP

The number of home-owning
households has fallen by 900,000
for the under-45s since 2010.

Labour will back first-time buyers

to buy that special first home. The
number of affordable homes to buy
has plummeted by two-thirds under
the Conservatives, so we will build
thousands more low-cost homes
reserved for first-time buyers. We
will guarantee Help to Buy funding
until 2027 to give long-term certainty
to both first-time buyers and the
housebuilding industry. We will also
give local people buying their first
home ‘first dibs’ on new homes built

CHAPTER 06 SECURE HOMES FOR ALL

in their area to give them confidence
that new homes will be available to
them and their families.

After seven years of failure under
the Conservatives, Labour will build
the new homes first-time buyers
need - just as Labour councils have
been doing right across the country,
building an average of nearly

1,000 more new homes than
Conservative councils.

We will back those who own their
homes, including home-owners who
own their home as leaseholders and
who are currently unprotected from
rises in ‘ground rent’ from developers
or management companies. A Labour
government will give leaseholders
security from rip-off ground rents
and end the routine use of leasehold
houses in new developments.

61

PRIVATE RENTERS

We will end insecurity for private
renters by introducing controls on
rent rises, more secure tenancies,
landlord licensing and new
consumer rights for renters.

Soaring rents are a real problem

- leading to more families living in
temporary accommodation, more
people sleeping rough, and many
not having enough money to save
up for a deposit or for a rainy day.

Labour will make new three-year
tenancies the norm, with an inflation
cap on rent rises. Given the particular
pressures in London we will look at
giving the Mayor the power to give
renters in London additional security.
We will legislate to ban letting agency
fees for tenants.

We will also empower tenants to

call time on bad landlords by giving
renters new consumer rights. Renters
are spending £9.6 billion a year on
homes that the government classes
as ‘non-decent’. Around a quarter

of this is paid by housing benefit.

A Labour government would
introduce new legal minimum
standards to ensure properties

are ‘fit for human habitation’ and
empower tenants to take action if
their rented homes are sub-standard.

62

We will reverse the cruel decision
to abolish housing benefit for

18 to 21- year-olds, which risks
putting even more vulnerable
young people on our streets.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

Under the Conservatives,
affordable housebuilding has
fallen to a 24-year low. Labour
will build the genuinely affordable
homes to rent and buy that the
country needs.

We will remove government
restrictions that stop councils
building homes and begin the
biggest council building programme
for at least 30 years. We will ditch
the Conservatives’ ban on long-term
council tenancies to give council
tenants security in their homes.

We want more people to have a
secure tenancy in a home built

to high standards.

Labour will scrap the punitive
bedroom tax, which has caused
many people to be evicted from
their home and their community.

More council homes have been

sold off under the Conservatives and
only one in five have been replaced,
despite long housing waiting lists.
Labour will suspend the right-to-buy
policy to protect affordable homes
for local people, with councils only
able to resume sales if they can prove
they have a plan to replace homes
sold like-for-like.

HOMELESSNESS

Homelessness is not inevitable in
a country as decent and well off
as ours. However, since 2010 the
number of people sleeping rough
in shop doorways and on park
benches has more than doubled.
This shames us all. There can be
no excuses - it must end. Full stop.

More families are living in temporary
accommodation, meaning 120,000
children spent last Christmas without
a home to call their own.

This growing homelessness shames
the Conservatives. The spiralling
rise in street homelessness results
directly from decisions made by
the Conservatives on pay, housing,
mental health and social security.

Labour will set out a new national
plan to end rough sleeping within
the next Parliament, starting by
making available 4,000 additional
homes reserved for people with a
history of rough sleeping. We will
also take action to tackle the root
causes of homelessness, including
safeguarding homeless hostels and
other supported housing from crude
Conservative cuts to housing benefit.

CHAPTER 07

HEALTHCARE
FOR ALL

 

NHS

In the aftermath of war and
national bankruptcy, it was a
Labour government that found
the resources to create a National
Health Service - our proudest
achievement, providing universal
healthcare for all on the basis of
need, free at the point of use.

Labour will invest in our NHS,

to give patients the modern,
well-resourced services they need
for the 21st century. Labour will
ensure that NHS patients get the
world-class quality of care they need
and that staff are able to deliver the
standards that patients expect.

We will guarantee and uphold

the standards of service to which
patients are legally entitled

under the NHS constitution.

By guaranteeing access to treatment
within 18 weeks, we will take one
million people off NHS waiting lists
by the end of the next Parliament.
We will guarantee that patients can
be seen in A&E within four hours.

By properly resourcing the NHS,
Labour will stop the routine breach
of safe levels of bed occupancy, and
we will end mixed-sex wards. We
will deliver the Cancer Strategy for
England in full by 2020, helping 2.5
million people living with cancer. And,
by properly resourcing ambulance
services, we will end the scandal of
slowing ambulance-response times.

66

Labour will focus resources

on services to provide care closer
to home and deliver a truly

21st century health system.

We will work towards a new model
of community care that takes into
account not only primary care but
also social care and mental health.
We will increase funding to GP
services to ensure patients can access
the care they need. And we will halt
pharmacy cuts and review provision
to ensure all patients have access
to pharmacy services, particularly in
deprived or remote communities.

Labour will tackle the growing
problem of rationing of services
and medicines across England,
taking action to address ‘postcode
lotteries’ and making sure that the
quality of care you receive does not
depend on which part of the country
you live in. We will ensure all NHS
patients get fast access to the most
effective new drugs and treatments,
and insist on value-for-money
agreements with pharmaceutical
companies.

To make sure that autistic people

are able to access the whole of

their community and to put an end
to social isolation, Labour will set

the ambition to make our country
autism-friendly. We will ensure that
everyone with a long-term condition,
such as those with diabetes, will have
the right to a specialised care plan,
and access to condition-management
education. We will ensure high-

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

quality, personalised care for people
approaching the end of their life,
wherever and whenever they need it.

Labour will ensure that NHS England
completes the trial programme

to provide PrEP (pre-exposure
prophylaxis) as quickly as possible,
and fully roll out the treatment to
high-risk groups to help reduce

HIV infection.

Labour will fund free parking in

NHS England - for patients, staff and
visitors - by increasing the tax on
private medical insurance premiums.

Public health

For our health and care services to be
sustainable in the long term, we need
a renewed commitment to keeping
people fit and well. Labour will focus
our efforts on children’s health,
protecting the wellbeing of the

nation for the decades to come.

(CHAPTER 07 HEALTHCARE FOR ALL

We will take action to significantly

reduce infant deaths and to ensure
all families who lose a baby receive
appropriate bereavement support.

Labour will invest in children’s

health, bringing in a new government
ambition for our children to be

the healthiest in the world. We will
fight health inequalities to break

the scandalous link between child
ill-health and poverty. We will
introduce a new Index of Child

Health to measure progress against
international standards, and report
annually against four key indicators:
obesity, dental health, under-fives and
mental health. We will set up a new
£250 million Children’s Health Fund
to support our ambitions. As part of a
preventative healthcare drive, Labour
will increase the number of health
visitors and school nurses.

We will publish a new childhood
obesity strategy within the first 100
days, with proposals on advertising

67

and food labelling. We will make a
concerted effort to address poor
childhood oral health in England.
Labour will implement the Soft Drinks
Industry Levy, commonly known as
the ‘sugar tax’.

We will implement a strategy for
the children of alcoholics based

on recommendations drawn up

by independent experts.

Labour will implement a Tobacco
Control Plan, focusing on issues of
mental health and young smokers.

Loneliness is an increasing problem
for our society, and as Jo Cox put

it, “young or old, loneliness doesn’t
discriminate”. A Labour government
will create a more equal society

for the many by working with
communities, civil society and
business to reduce loneliness.

Labour will address historic public-
health injustices. We will hold a public
enquiry into contaminated blood.

We will also hold a public inquiry

into medicines, including Valproate,
medical devices and medical
products licensing and regulation.

A Labour government would

maintain our commitment to improve
sexual-health services, especially HIV
services which will include reducing
the rates of undiagnosed and late-
diagnosed HIV, ending the stigma

of HIV in society, and promoting

the increased availability of testing
and treatment.

68

NHS staff

To guarantee the best possible
services for patients, Labour

will invest in our health and care
workforce. A Labour government

will step in with a long-term
workforce plan for our health service
that gives staff the support they need
to do the best for their patients.

Labour will scrap the NHS pay cap,
put pay decisions back into the hands
of the independent pay review body
and give our NHS workers the pay
they deserve. Labour will protect
patients and legislate to ensure

safe staffing levels in the NHS.

Labour's long-term ambition is for
our health system to have the best
trained staff in the world, ready to
deal with whatever they have to face
in the years to come. Labour will
re-introduce bursaries and funding
for health-related degrees. Labour
will support doctors to deliver the
best care possible by investing in the
training, education and development
of doctors throughout their careers.

Labour will immediately guarantee
the rights of EU staff working in our
health and care services. Labour
will support NHS whistleblowers to
make sure health service staff are
able to speak up in support of the
best possible standards for patients.
Labour will make it an aggravated
criminal offence to attack NHS staff.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

NHS funding

Labour will commit to over

£30 billion in extra funding over the
next Parliament through increasing
income tax for the highest 5 per cent
of earners and by increasing tax on
private medical insurance, and we will
free up resources by halving the fees
paid to management consultants.

Labour will boost capital funding

for the NHS, to ensure that patients
are cared for in buildings and using
equipment that are fit for the 21st
century. And we will introduce a new
Office for Budget Responsibility for
Health to oversee health spending
and scrutinise how it is spent.

Labour will halt and review the NHS
‘Sustainability and Transformation
Plans’, which are looking at closing
health services across England, and
ask local people to participate in the
redrawing of plans with a focus on
patient need rather than available
finances. We will create a new quality,
safety and excellence regulator -

to be called ‘NHS Excellence’.

The next Labour government will
reverse privatisation of our NHS and
return our health service into expert
public control. Labour will repeal the
Health and Social Care Act that puts
profits before patients, and make
the NHS the preferred provider.

We will reinstate the powers of the
Secretary of State for Health to have
overall responsibility for the NHS.

(CHAPTER 07 HEALTHCARE FOR ALL

We will introduce a new legal duty

on the Secretary of State and on NHS
England to ensure that excess private
profits are not made out of the NHS
at the expense of patient care.

69

 

 

TOWARDS
A NATIONAL
CARE SERVICE

Our social care sector is in crisis,
with severe consequences for the
quality of care, public finances,
personal assets, pressures on
unpaid carers of family and
friends, and delays to discharging
patients from hospitals.

Care services have been slowly but
relentlessly privatised. In recent
years, one in ten people reaching
the age of 65 have faced lifetime care
costs of over £100,000, with some
homeowners paying the entire value
of their homes.

The Conservatives’ cuts have led

to £4.6 billion lost from social care
budgets, despite rising demand.
Around 1.2 million older people
have care needs that are going
unmet. Care in the community has
become a cover for unseen neglect.

In our first term, Labour will lay
the foundations of a National Care
Service for England.

Our first urgent task will be to
address the immediate funding
crisis. We will increase the social care
budgets by a further £8 billion over
the lifetime of the next Parliament,
including an additional £1 billion for

(CHAPTER 07 HEALTHCARE FOR ALL

the first year. This will be enough
for providers to pay a real living
wage without cutting the quality

of care they provide. It will allow
implementation of the principles
of the Ethical Care Charter, already
adopted in 28 council areas, ending
15-minute care visits and providing
care workers with paid travel time,
access to training and an option to
choose regular hours.

Labour will also increase the Carer’s
Allowance for unpaid full-time carers
to align the benefit with rates of the
Jobseeker’s Allowance.

Short-term funding solutions

will not address the fundamental
long-term challenges of our
ageing demographics, nor meet
the growing demands arising from
late-life illnesses.

The National Care Service will be
built alongside the NHS, with a
shared requirement for single
commissioning, partnership
arrangements, pooled budgets
and joint working arrangements.
We will build capacity to move
quickly towards a joined-up service
that will signpost users to all the
appropriate services at the gateway
through which they arrive.

In its first years, our service will
require an additional £3 billion of
public funds every year, enough to
place a maximum limit on lifetime

71

personal contributions to care costs,
raise the asset threshold below
which people are entitled to state
support, and provide free end of life
care. There are different ways the
necessary monies can be raised. We
will seek consensus on a cross-party
basis about how it should be funded,
with options including wealth taxes,
an employer care contribution or a
new social care levy.

Improving the quality of social care
is a vital part of providing dignity
in older age and independence
and support for people who are
vulnerable or have a disability

or a mental health condition.

Labour will build a new National
Care Service. We will also set out
the funding alternatives clearly and
honestly, seeking to implement
change through consensus.
Providing dignity and care in

old age should transcend party
politics and campaign slogans.

72

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

MENTAL HEALTH

Mental ill-health is the biggest
unaddressed health challenge of
our age. Around one in four people
in the UK will experience a mental
health problem each year.

Yet, since 2010 mental health funding
has been cut, the number of mental
health nurses has fallen by 6,600 and
remaining mental health budgets
have been raided to plug holes
elsewhere in the NHS.

Labour will work to reverse the
damage done to mental health
services under this Tory government,
which is particularly hitting services
for LGBT and BAME communities.

In order to protect services, we will
ring-fence mental health budgets and
ensure funding reaches the frontline.

We will end the scandal of children
being treated on adult mental health
wards and stop people being sent
across the country, away from their
support networks, to secure the
treatment they need by bringing
forward the ending of out-of-area
placements to 2019.

Labour will also bring an end to
the neglect of children’s mental
health. Half of people with mental
health problems as adults present
with symptoms by the age of 14.
Yet, across England only 8 per cent

(CHAPTER 07 HEALTHCARE FOR ALL

of mental health funding goes to
services for children and young
people. In recent years, referrals

to Child and Adolescent Mental
Health Services have increased by
two-thirds, and the number of young
people presenting to A&E units with
psychiatric conditions has doubled.
Suicide is now the most common
cause of death for boys aged
between five and 19.

Labour will invest in early
intervention by increasing the
proportion of mental health
budgets spent on support for
children and young people.

We will ensure that access to a
counselling service is available for
all children in secondary schools.

Giving mental health the same
priority as physical health means
not only ensuring access to services,
but also making improvements,

to those services. Choice is important
in a modern NHS, and patients

who receive their therapy of choice
have better outcomes. Labour will
therefore ask the National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE) to evaluate the potential

for increasing the range of evidence-
based psychological therapies

on offer.

POLICE
AND CRIME

Last year, there were an estimated
6.1 million incidents of crime
experienced by adults in England
and Wales. Almost every police
force in the country recorded an
increase in crime, with worrying
rises in some of the most violent
offences, including gun and knife
crime and homicide.

On Theresa May's watch, police
numbers have been cut by 20,000.
Cuts to the police force endanger
communities and endanger police
officers too. Labour's approach to
policing crime will be different.

76

We will support the police in the
performance of their duties. We will
provide officers, police community
support officers and civilian staff with
the equipment and people they need
to provide effective policing services,
including from the growing threat of
cybercrime. We will work with them
to ensure that our communities are
safer, for all of us.

We will champion community policing
policies and incentivise good policing
practice, working with Police and
Crime Commissioners throughout
the country on strategies to prevent
crime. We will also work to eliminate
institutional biases against BAME
communities, that mean you are still
far more likely to be stopped and
searched as a black or Asian man.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

Labour will recruit 10,000 more police
officers to work on community beats,
equivalent to at least one more for
every neighbourhood in the country.

We will ensure appropriate support
is provided to victims of crime and
introduce legislation for minimum
standard entitlements to service from
criminal justice agencies.

The level of violence against

women and girls is not acceptable.
Labour will emphasise the safety

of women and girls by appointing

a commissioner to set new standards
for tackling domestic and sexual
violence. We will establish a National
Refuge Fund and ensure stability

for rape crisis centres. We will make
age-appropriate sex and relationship
education a compulsory part of the
curriculum so young people can learn
about respectful relationships.

We will strengthen the law, banning
the use of community resolutions as
a response to domestic violence.

Labour will continue to enforce
effective measures to prevent all
forms of abuse, including female
genital mutilation.

Security and counter-terrorism

Labour will maintain the cross-border
security co-operation agreements
with our intelligence partners in
Europe and beyond. We will always
provide our security agencies with

CHAPTER 08 SAFER COMMUNITIES

the resources and the powers they
need to protect our country and
keep us all safe. We will also ensure
that such powers do not weaken our
individual rights or civil liberties.

When - as they sometimes will -
these aims collide, the exercise of
investigatory powers must always

be both proportionate and necessary.
We will reintroduce effective judicial
oversight over how and when they
are used, when the circumstances
demand that our collective security
outweighs an individual freedom.

Labour will review the Prevent
programme with a view to assessing
both its effectiveness and its potential
to alienate minority communities.

In doing so, we will address the
government's failure to take any
effective new measures against

a growing problem of extreme

or violent radicalisation.

FIRE AND
RESCUE SERVICES

Labour will halt cuts to the

Fire Service. The Conservatives
have cut 10,000 firefighter jobs
and closed dozens of fire stations.
As a result, response times have
got slower and lives have been put
at risk.

Labour will recruit 3,000 new
firefighters, review staffing levels,
and consult on national minimum
standards for the service. We will
reinstate separate governance
arrangements for Fire and

Police Services.

We will give the Fire and Rescue
Services a statutory duty to co-
ordinate and respond to floods.

JUSTICE

We all need access to the justice
system to protect us from those
who would deny us our rights.
Labour will set out to make Britain
a fair society with liberties for all,
governed by the rule of law, and in
which the law is enforced equally.

The Conservatives threaten our
Human Rights Act and may withdraw
us from the European Convention of
Human Rights. Labour will retain the
Human Rights Act.

Justice is all too often denied.

Too many ordinary people know
this. There are football fans, trade
unionists, environmental activists
and people living with disabilities
whose personal experiences
provide first-hand testimony.

Labour will hold public inquiries
into historic injustices. We will
open inquiries into Orgreave and
blacklisting. We will release all
papers relating to the Shrewsbury
24 trials and the 37 Cammell Laird
shipyard workers.

Justice today has become the
preserve of the rich. Budget cuts
mean that thousands are deprived
of fair resolutions. Justice is eroded
by the poor decisions of privatised
assessments, by the withdrawal of
legal aid, by the removal of appeal

80

rights, by the delays arising from
overcrowded courts and by the
costs of fees.

Eligibility for legal aid has been
withdrawn across a whole range
of areas. This has had disturbing
consequences for the delivery
of justice.

Democracy is founded upon the

rule of law and judicial independence.
We will also review the judicial
appointments process, to ensure a
judiciary that is more representative
of our society.

Labour will immediately

re-establish early advice entitlements
in the Family Courts. The shameful
consequences of withdrawal have
included a requirement for victims

of domestic abuse to pay doctors for
certification of their injuries. Labour's
plans will remove that requirement.
At the same time, we will legislate

to prohibit the cross examination of
victims of domestic violence by their
abuser in certain circumstances.

We will reintroduce funding for the
preparation of judicial review cases.
Judicial review is an important way
of holding government to account.
There are sufficient safeguards to
discourage unmeritorious cases.

We will review the legal aid means
tests, including the capital test for
those on income-related benefits.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

Labour will consider the
reinstatement of other legal aid
entitlements after receiving the final
recommendations of the Access to
Justice Commission led by Lord Bach.

The justice system can be bewildering
and intimidating. There are many

improvements that can be made both
to the law and to the court processes.

Labour will introduce a no-fault
divorce procedure.

A Labour government will consult
on establishing an environmental
tribunal with simplified procedures
to hear challenges to unlawful
government decisions, like those
made on the air quality strategy,
without engaging in prohibitively
expensive processes.

Labour will not prohibit the courts
from raising monies to provide
services, but we will introduce a
ratio to establish the maximum
difference between actual costs
and charges levied.

Labour will continue to extend

the use of technology in our court
service where it enhances access to
justice, timely dispute resolution and
efficient administration.

PRISONS AND
PROBATION
SERVICE

Labour is tough on crime and
tough on the causes of crime, but
we won't make the lives of workers
in the criminal justice system
tougher. Prison officers, probation
officers and other workers need
the resources to do their jobs
safely, effectively and successfully.

Our prisons are overcrowded.
Staffing levels are too low. The
situation is dangerous and violence
against prison officers is rising. Riots
and disturbances in our prisons are
increasing. Prison escapes cause
distress to people living near prisons.

A Labour government will publish
annual reports on prisoner-staff
ratios, with a view to maintaining
safety and ending overcrowding.

We will recruit 3,000 more prison
officers and review the training and
professional development available.
We will publish prison officer to
prisoner ratios for all prisons. Our
proposal to lift the public sector

pay cap will help to increase the
recruitment and retention of both
prison officers and probation officers.

Re-offending rates are too high.
The Conservatives talked of a

82

rehabilitation revolution, and

then just gave up. Their proposal
now is to lock up more and more
individuals, ignoring the evidence
that our prisons are too often
dumping grounds for people who
need treatment more than they need
punishment. Labour will insist on
personal rehabilitation plans for

all prisoners.

Prison should always be a last resort
- the state’s most severe sanction for
serious offences. It should never be

a substitute for failing mental health
services, or the withdrawal of funding
from drug treatment centres. We will
review the provision of mental health
services in prisons.

Under a Labour government,

there will be no new private prisons
and no public sector prisons will

be privatised.

Labour's innovative models of youth
justice successfully turned round
the lives of many young people,
steering them away from crime

and towards more constructive
ways. In government, we will again
continue to innovate and incentivise
local authorities, police forces

and probation services to engage
effectively with young people at

risk of drifting into anti-social or
criminal behaviours. We will embed
restorative justice practices across
all youth offending institutions.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

The part-privatisation of probation
services has already failed.

Labour will review the role
of Community Rehabilitation
Companies.

The Conservatives bulldozed changes
to the probation service through
despite warnings that they had not
been tested and were founded on

a weak evidence base.

LOCAL
COMMUNITIES

Councils deliver vital local
services to our communities,

but their budgets have been
slashed by Conservative cuts.
This has led to a deterioration of
local services, from bin collection
to road repair, and the loss of
important community assets
such as libraries, youth centres
and women’s refuges.

Labour believes in devolving power

to local communities but that requires
the necessary funding follows.

You cannot empower local
government if you impoverish it.

A Labour government will give local
government extra funding next year.
We will initiate a review into
reforming council tax and business
rates and consider new options
such as a land value tax, to ensure
local government has sustainable
funding for the long term.

Labour is the party of devolution

and we believe in handing back power
to communities. We will devolve
powers over economic development,
complete with the necessary funding.

It is through the planning system
that communities can shape the
kinds of high streets, homes and
amenities that they want. But under
the Conservatives, planning has been

86

under-resourced and disempowered,
with democratic planning authorities
unable to stand up to big developers.
As a result, planning decisions have
become too influenced by narrow
economic considerations, with
developers’ profit taking precedence
over community priorities.

A Labour government will properly
resource and bolster planning
authorities with fuller powers to
put people and communities at the
heart of planning. We will update
compulsory purchase powers to
make them more effective as a tool
to drive regeneration and unlock
planned development.

Under the Conservatives, nearly
£400 million has been cut from youth
services and over 600 youth centres
have closed. Labour will end the cuts
to youth services.

We will continue to support all
training routes for social workers,
including initial social work training
provided within or accredited by a
higher education institution. We will
also prevent the private sector and
subsidiaries of private companies
from running child protection
services. We will deliver earlier
protection to victims of abuse by
strengthening mandatory reporting,
and guaranteeing allegations will be
reported and action taken to make
children safe.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

And we will refocus social care to work
with families in local communities to
prevent children becoming at risk of
going into care.

The government is currently

failing to develop a strategy for

the wholesale improvement of

the care system that delivers for

all, not just those children being
considered for adoption. We will
promote the care and educational
achievement of our most vulnerable
children and increase support for
children in kinship and foster care,
and their families. It is important

that other forms of care, such as
kinship care and fostering, are not
marginalised, as this will not result

in the step-change we need to see

in outcomes for looked after children.
Labour will support further regulation

CHAPTER 09 LEADING RICHER LIVES

of commercial fostering agencies,
as well as commissioning a review
on establishing a national
fostering service.

We will extend Staying Put
arrangements to support all
children and young people in
residential and other forms of
care until they are 21.

We will enshrine the European
Convention on the Rights of
the Child into domestic law.

Labour will fund child burial fees for
bereaved parents, ensuring that they
are scrapped in all council areas. We
recognise that some councils have
already made this humane move.

Libraries are vital social assets, valued
by communities across the country.

87

We will ensure libraries are preserved
for future generations and updated
with wi-fi and computers to meet
modern needs. We will reintroduce
library standards so that government
can assess and guide councils in
delivering the best possible service.

Labour will end the closure of
Crown Post Office branches, which
play a major role in serving their
communities. We will also set up

a commission to establish a Post
Bank, owned by the Post Office and
providing a full range of banking
services in every community.

Labour will give communities more
power to shape their town centres,
by strengthening powers to protect
post offices, community pharmacies,
high street banks, sports clubs,

pubs and independent shops,

and promote measures to decrease
high-street vacancies.

We will set up a national review of
local pubs to examine the causes for
their large-scale demise, as well as
establishing a joint taskforce that
will consider future sustainability.

We will reduce the maximum stake
on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals
from £100 to £2. Labour will also
legislate to increase the delay
between spins to reduce the
addictive nature of the games.

We will give members of the

Local Government Pension Scheme
full trustee status to help control
investments, and reduce fees

and charges.

This Conservative government has
taken rural communities for granted,
with chronic underinvestment in
transport, broadband and public
services, including the closure of local
schools, post offices and libraries.

Rural infrastructure and industry has
been neglected. Labour will invest in
broadband, housing and transport
to create jobs and ensure that the
nation’s prosperity is felt beyond

our large towns and cities.

 

Labour's national investment
plans include coastal protections,
better flood management and the
broadband and 4G extensions that
will underpin the future success

of rural small businesses.

Rural councils deliver public services
differently, and this needs to be
reflected in funding allocation
mechanisms. We will consider

these differences in our re-evaluation
of the business rate schemes.

We will introduce a ‘rural-proofing’
process so that all our laws, policies
and programmes consider their
impact on rural communities.

heart of government. The tourism
industry represents 9.6 per cent

of UK employment, 4.9 per cent of
export and 9 per cent of GDP, but its
importance is too often forgotten.
Labour will ensure that tourism
becomes a national priority again.
We will reinstate the cross-Whitehall
ministerial group on tourism, and
ensure that government ministers
across departments understand
how their roles fit into the national
tourism agenda.

We will make utility companies return
roads to a condition no worse than
when they started digging.

The Conservatives have failed

to provide a clear, ambitious or
sustainable vision for the future of the
farming, food and fishing industries.

We will expand the role of the
Groceries Code Adjudicator to
ensure suppliers and consumers
get a fair deal.

We will reconfigure funds for farming
and fishing to support smaller traders,
local economies, community benefits
and sustainable practices.

We will allow EU workers employed
across farming, fishing and food
manufacturing to remain in the UK,
and reinstate the Seasonal Agricultural
Workers Scheme.

CHAPTER 09 LEADING RICHER LIVES 89

TRANSPORT

Labour will invest in a modern,
integrated, accessible and
sustainable transport system
that is reliable and affordable.

Our transport systems illustrate

the abject failure of Tory policies:
relentless deregulation, privatisation
and fragmentation.

They say we get choice and
efficiency but the reality of their
transport privatisations has been
that services are less reliable, safety
is compromised, fares have risen,
ticketing has become complicated
and air quality has worsened.

On our railways, we pay some
of the highest fares in Europe
for increasingly unreliable and
overcrowded services.

The beneficiaries of public funding
siphoned off through transport
privatisations have been the
earnings of directors, dividends
for shareholders and the coffers
of overseas governments.

Labour will prioritise public service
over private profit. And we will start
by bringing our railways back into
public ownership, as franchises
expire or, in other cases, with
franchise reviews or break clauses.
We will introduce a Public Ownership
of the Railways Bill to repeal the

90

Railways Act 1993 under which the
Conservatives privatised our railways.

In public ownership, we will deliver
real improvements for passengers
by capping fares, introducing free
wi-fi across the network, ensuring
safe staffing levels, ending the
expansion of driver only operations,
and introducing legal duties to
improve accessibility for people
with disabilities.

Across the country we will enable
councils to provide first-class bus
services by extending the powers to
re-regulate local bus services to all
areas that want them, and we will
support the creation of municipal bus
companies that are publicly run for
passengers not profit.

Under the Conservatives, bus fares
have risen and services have been
cut. Labour will introduce regulations
to designate and protect routes of
critical community value, including
those that serve local schools,
hospitals and isolated settlements in
rural areas.

A publicly owned railway system can
be the backbone of our plans for
integrated transport. It will be built
on the platform of Network Rail,
which we will retain whole, working
with the devolved administrations.
We will ensure new rolling stock is
publicly owned and will encourage
expansion of public freight services

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

in a publicly owned railway that will
leave our roads freer of traffic and
our air cleaner. We will facilitate
British procurements, including
steel, whenever possible.

A Labour government will invest to
regenerate the local and regional
economies across the whole country,
so that every area gets its fair share
of transport investment.

A Labour government will complete
the HS2 high-speed rail line from
London through Birmingham to
Leeds and Manchester and then
into Scotland, consulting with
communities affected about the
optimal route. We will link HS2

with other rail investments, such as
Crossrail of the North (tying together
our great Northern cities) and on to
the Durham Freight Centre. We will
build a new Brighton Main Line for
the South East.

In London, to ensure our capital
continues to prosper, we will build
Crossrail 2.

To harness the economic potential
of new technologies and science,
we will complete the Science Vale
transport arc that runs from Oxford

to Cambridge through Milton Keynes.

And we will deliver rail electrification
and expansion across the whole
country, including in Wales and the
South West. We will also consult
with local communities to re-open
branch lines.

CHAPTER 09 LEADING RICHER LIVES

 

To prepare for global new trade
arrangements, we will study the
feasibility of port development
across the UK.

We will invest in Scotland,

Wales and Northern Ireland

too, working with devolved
administrations through the UK
National Infrastructure Commission
and its devolved counterparts.

Our plans will encourage and
enable people to get out of their
cars, for better health and a cleaner
environment.

Labour will position the UK at the
forefront of the development,
manufacture and use of ultra low
emission vehicles, supporting the
creation of clean modes of transport
through investment in low emission
vehicles.

We will retrofit thousands of diesel
buses in areas with the most severe air
quality problems to Euro 6 standards.

91

We will reform the legislation
governing taxi and private hire
services, introducing national
standards to guarantee safety and
accessibility, updating regulations
to keep pace with technological
change and ensuring a level playing
field between operators.

We will invite the National
Infrastructure Commission to
recommend the next stages for
developing and upgrading the
National Cycle Network. We reaffirm
the commitments in the Cycling and
Walking Investment Strategy.

We will continue to upgrade our
highways and improve roadworks at
known bottlenecks. The A1 North, the
Severn Bridge and the A30 provide

essential connections and require our

urgent consideration. We will work
with the Welsh Government to scrap
the tolls on the Severn Bridge.

After seven years of stalled progress,
Labour will reset the UK's road
safety vision and ambitiously strive
for a transport network with zero
deaths, reintroducing road-safety
targets, setting out bold measures
that will continuously improve safety
standards.

We will refocus the roads building
and maintenance programmes,
connecting our communities, feeding
public transport hubs and realising
untapped economic potential.

92

Labour recognises the need for
additional airport capacity in the
South East. We welcome the work
done by the Airports Commission,
and we will guarantee that any
airport expansion adheres to our
tests that require noise issues to
be addressed, air quality to be
protected, the UK's climate change
obligations met and growth across
the country supported.

We will continue working with our
neighbours through the European
Union's Highways of the Sea
programme and by negotiating to
retain membership of the Common
Aviation Area and Open Skies
arrangements.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

Investing in our environment

is investing in our future. We

will defend and extend existing
environmental protections. We
will champion sustainable farming,
food and fishing by investing in
and promoting skills, technology,
market access and innovation.

The Conservatives broke their
promise to be the greenest
government ever. They have

allowed fracking in national parks,
evaded their responsibilities on air
quality and cut the funding for flood
defences. The future of our farming,
food and fishing industries hangs

in the balance, to be used as leverage
in Brexit negotiations.

Only a Labour government will

prioritise a sustainable, long-term
future for our farming, fishing and
food industries, fund robust flood

resilience, invest in rural and coastal
communities, and guarantee the
protection and advancement of
environmental quality standards.

The Conservatives’ threatened
‘bonfire of red tape’ is a threat to

our environmental protections and
to the quality of our lives. Their
record on combating climate change
and environmental damage has been
one of inaction and broken promises.

The balance needs resetting: our

air is killing us, our farms face an
uncertain future, our fish stocks

are collapsing, our oceans are used
as dumping grounds, and our forests,
green belt, national parks, Areas

of Outstanding Natural Beauty and
Sites of Special Scientific Interest

are all under threat.

Labour will introduce a new Clean
Air Act to deal with the Conservative
legacy of illegal air quality. We will
safeguard habitats and species in the

‘blue belts’ of the seas and oceans
surrounding our island. We will

set guiding targets for plastic bottle
deposit schemes, working with
food manufacturers and retailers
to reduce waste. We will protect our
bees by prohibiting neonicotinoids
as soon as our EU relationship
allows us to do so. We will work
with farmers and foresters to plant
a million trees of native species to
promote biodiversity and better
flood management. Unlike the
Conservatives who attempted to
privatise our forests, Labour will
keep them in public hands.

Our stewardship of the environment
needs to be founded on sound
principles and based on scientific
assessments. We will establish

a science innovation fund, working
with farmers and fisheries, that will
include support for our small scale
fishing fleet.

 

94

ANIMAL WELFARE

Animals in our food chain need
welfare standards. Domestic
animals require stronger protection
from cruelty. Wild animals

need a sustainable ecosystem.

Labour's vision is for the UK to lead
the world with high animal welfare
standards in the wild, in farming and
for domestic animals. Labour will
increase the maximum sentence

for those convicted of committing
animal cruelty.

We will promote cruelty-free
animal husbandry and consult on
ways to ensure better enforcement
of agreed standards.

We will prohibit the third-party sale
of puppies, introduce and enforce
a total ban on ivory trading, and
support the ban on wild animals

in circuses.

We will cease the badger cull,
which spreads bovine TB.

Labour ended fox hunting, deer
hunting and hare coursing.
Only a Labour government will
maintain the bans.

CULTURE
FOR ALL

Britain's creative industries are
the envy of the world, a source of
national pride, a driver of inward
investment and tourism, and a
symbol of the kind of country

we are now and aspire to be in
the future. As Britain leaves the
EU, we will put our world-class
creative sector at the heart of our
negotiations and future industrial
strategy. We need to do more to
open up the arts and creative
industries to everyone.

We will introduce a £1 billion Cultural
Capital Fund to upgrade our existing
cultural and creative infrastructure
to be ready for the digital age and
invest in creative clusters across the
country, based on a similar model
to enterprise zones. Administered
by the Arts Council, the fund

will be available over a five-year
period. It will be among the biggest
arts infrastructure funds ever,
transforming the country's cultural
landscape.

Labour will maintain free entry to
museums and invest in our museums
and heritage sector. Conservative
cuts to the Arts Council and local
authorities have created a very

tough financial climate for museums,
with some closing or reducing

CHAPTER 09 LEADING RICHER LIVES

their services, and others starting

to charge entry fees. The Cultural
Capital Fund will have a particular
focus on projects that could increase
museums’ and galleries’ income

and viability.

Labour will end cuts to local authority
budgets to support the provision of
libraries, museums and galleries.

We will take steps to widen the reach
of the Government Art Collection so
that more people can enjoy it.

We will continue to mark the ongoing
centenary of the First World War,

and the sacrifice of all those who died
during it. Labour remains committed
‘o honouring the role of all who

have served our country, including
he Sikh, Hindu, Muslim and Jewish
soldiers who fought for Britain.

Our thriving creative sector, from
he games industry to fashion,
needs a strong pipeline of skilled
‘alent to sustain its growth.

Labour will introduce an arts pupil
premium to every primary school

in England - a £160 million annual
per year boost for schools to invest
in projects that will support cultural
activities for schools over the longer
erm. We will put creativity back at
he heart of the curriculum, reviewing
he EBacc performance measure

‘o make sure arts are not sidelined
from secondary education.

 

Labour will launch a creative careers
advice campaign in schools to

95

demonstrate the range of careers
and opportunities available, and
the skills required in the creative
industries, from the tech sector to
theatre production.

Being a performer is a great career.
But too often the culture of low or
no pay means it isn’t an option for
those without well-off families to
support them. We will work with
trade unions and employers to agree
sector-specific advice and guidelines
on pay and employment standards
that will make the sector more
accessible to all.

We will improve diversity on and off-
screen, working with the film industry
and public service and commercial
broadcasters to find rapid solutions
to improve diversity.

We recognise the serious concern
about the ‘value gap’ between
producers of creative content and
the digital services that profit from its
use, and we will work with all sides to
review the way that innovators and
artists are rewarded for their work in
the digital age.

Music venues play a vital role in
supporting the music industry's
infrastructure and ensuring a healthy
music industry continues in Britain.
Labour will review extending the
£1,000 pub relief business rates
scheme to small music venues.

96

And we will introduce an ‘agent
of change’ principle in planning
law, to ensure that new housing
developments can coexist with
existing music venues.

We all need to work harder to keep
children safe online. Labour will
ensure that tech companies are
obliged to take measures that further
protect children and tackle online
abuse. We will ensure that young
people understand and are able

to easily remove any content they
shared on the internet before they
turned 18.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

MEDIA

The BBC is a national asset which
we should all be proud of. Unlike
the Conservatives, Labour will
always support it and uphold

its independence. We will ensure
the BBC and public service

broadcasting has a healthy future.

Labour is committed to keeping
Channel 4 in public ownership
and will guarantee the future of
Welsh-language broadcaster S4C.

Victims of phone hacking have
been let down by a Conservative
government that promised

them justice, but failed to follow
through. We will implement the
recommendations of part one of
the Leveson Inquiry and commence
part two which will look into the
corporate governance failures
that allowed the hacking scandal
to occur.

Local newspapers and broadcasting

in Britain are an important part

of our democracy and culture.

We are concerned about closures
of local media outlets and the
reductions in number of local
journalists. Labour will hold a
national review local media

and into the ownership of
national media to ensure plurality.

CHAPTER 09 LEADING RICHER LIVES

To protect democracy and media
freedom, we will take steps to

ensure that Ofcom is better able to
safeguard a healthy plurality of media
ownership and to put in place clearer
rules on who is fit and proper to own
or run TV and radio stations.

97

 

SPORT

Sport must be run in the interests
of those who participate in it and

love it, not just for a privileged few.

We will give football supporters
the opportunity to have a greater
say in how their clubs are run.

We will legislate for accredited
supporters trusts to be able to
appoint and remove at least two
club directors and to purchase
shares when clubs change hands.
We will review fan participation in
sports governance more widely.

Sporting events must be open

and accessible to all. We will push
sports authorities to make rapid
improvements on access provision
for fans with disabilities.

Labour will ensure the Premier
League delivers on its promise to
invest 5 per cent of its television
rights income into the grassroots
game to help the next generation of
players and coaches, and to improve
facilities and pitches. The Premier
League has so far failed to do so,
despite lucrative new domestic and
international TV deals.

CHAPTER 09 LEADING RICHER LIVES

The broken ticketing market in the
UK means tickets sell out instantly
and are put up at vastly inflated
prices on ticket-tout websites. Labour
will enforce anti-bot legislation and
implement the recommendations of
the Waterson Review to ensure fair
opportunities for fans to buy tickets.

EXTENDING
DEMOCRACY

As we change our
constitutional relationship with
Europe, we must also adjust
our own arrangements. Just as
many felt that power was too
centralised and unaccountable
in Brussels, so many feel that
about Westminster.

A Labour government will establish a
Constitutional Convention to examine
and advise on reforming of the way
Britain works at a fundamental level.

We will consult on its form
and terms of reference and
invite recommendations on
extending democracy.

102

 

This is about where power and
sovereignty lies - in politics, the
economy, the justice system, and in
our communities.

The Convention will look at extending
democracy locally, regionally and
nationally, considering the option

of a more federalised country.

Our fundamental belief is that

the Second Chamber should be
democratically elected. In the
interim period, we will seek to

end the hereditary principle and
reduce the size of the current House
of Lords as part of a wider package
of constitutional reform to address
the growing democratic deficit
across Britain.

We will extend the Freedom of
Information Act to private
companies that run public services.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

We will reduce the voting age to 16.
At 16, you are eligible to pay tax, get
married or even join the army.

You deserve a vote.

We will safeguard our democracy
by repealing the Lobbying Act,
which has gagged charities, and
introduce a tougher statutory
register of lobbyists.

ENGLAND

We need a relationship

of equals with devolved
administrations. Labour will
create a role for a Minister
for England, who will sit
under the Secretary of State
for Communities and Local
Government, and will work
with the Secretaries of State
for Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.

We will restore regional offices to
increase contact between central

and local government on the ground.

Labour will be guided by public

opinion when determining whether
to include directly elected mayors in
future devolution deals.

CHAPTER 10 EXTENDING DEMOCRACY 103

 

SCOTLAND We will set up an inquiry into

blacklisting and will urge the Scottish
Government to hold an inquiry into
the actions of Scottish police during
the miners’ strike.

Labour opposes a second
Scottish independence
referendum. It is unwanted
and unnecessary, and we

will campaign tirelessly to
ensure Scotland remains part
of the UK. Independence would
lead to turbo-charged austerity
for Scottish families.

The Scottish Parliament will receive
a huge funding increase from our
policies, and massive numbers of
Scots will benefit from our plans

in areas reserved to Westminster.

We will establish a Scottish
Investment Bank, with £20 billion of
funds available to local projects and
Scotland's small businesses, creating
work and stimulating the economy.

104 FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

WALES We will bring forward legislation to

make the devolution settlement more
sustainable as set out by the Welsh
Labour government in its Alternative
Wales Bill, including the devolution

of policing.

We are proud of the
achievements of the Welsh
Labour government and

its record of delivery. In
government, we will work in
partnership to stand up for the
people of Wales and protect
public services.

We need long-term reform of how
the UK allocates public expenditure
to ensure that it reflects the needs
of different parts of our country and
that no nation or region of the UK

is unfairly disadvantaged.

We will build on the Development
Bank of Wales using more than £10
billion from Labour's new National
Investment Bank.

CHAPTER 10 EXTENDING DEMOCRACY 105

 

NORTHERN
IRELAND

The peace we have today in
Northern Ireland is due to the
courageous endeavours of
those on all sides who have
been brave enough to build it.

The Good Friday Agreement, which
Labour helped to negotiate, is one
of the greatest achievements of
Labour in office.

We will continue to fully support the
principles and structures inherent
within the Good Friday Agreement
and we remain committed to
working with all sides to deliver

real peace and greater prosperity
to Northern Ireland.

A MORE EQUAL
SOCIETY

The Labour Party is the party
of equality and seeks to build a
society and world free from all
forms of racism, anti-Semitism
and Islamophobia. Labour has
a strong record on progressing
women’s rights and freedoms
that we can be proud of.

Labour brought in the Equal Pay
Act, the Sex Discrimination Act,
the Equality Act, the Minimum
Wage and introduced Sure Start.
Every progressive piece of equality
legislation has been delivered

by Labour.

Under the Conservatives, progress is
being rolled back for women, people
with disabilities, LGBT people and
BAME communities. Cuts to public
services and social security are

landing disproportionately on women

and ethnic minorities, with 86 per
cent of the money raised from the

Tories’ tax and social security changes

coming from women’s pockets.

It was a Labour government

that enshrined the rights and
freedoms contained in the European
Convention on Human Rights into
UK law, marking the birth of the
Human Rights Act.

108

Devastating cuts to the Equality

and Human Rights Commission by
the Conservatives reveal their real
attitude, beyond the rhetoric, to
issues of equality and discrimination.
These cuts have been made amid
the rise in hate crime recorded by
the police in the last year. A Labour
government will enhance the powers
and functions of this commission,
making it truly independent, to
ensure it can support ordinary
working people to effectively
challenge any discrimination they
may face. A Labour government will
reinstate the public sector equality
duties and seek to extend them to
the private sector, ensuring

all citizens benefit from this

Labour legislation.

 

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

WOMEN

The advances for women in
Britain and around the world
have been fought and won by
determined women working
together for real change, often
in the face of resistance and
even abuse.

Labour has a proud record on
progressing women’s rights and
freedoms. We brought in the Equal
Pay Act, the Sex Discrimination Act,
the Equality Act, the Minimum Wage
and introduced Sure Start. Ours will
be a government for women, with

a cabinet of at least 50 per cent
women, which fights inequality and
misogyny in every part of society.

A Labour government will gender
audit all policy and legislation

for its impact on women before
implementation.

CHAPTER 11 A MORE EQUAL SOCIETY,

Labour will continue to ensure

a woman's right to choose a safe,
legal abortion - and we will work
with the Assembly to extend that
right to women in Northern Ireland.

Violence against women and girls
continues to be a global epidemic,
affecting an estimated one in three
women worldwide. In the UK, on
average two women are killed by
their current or a former partner
every week. Under the Conservatives,
over a third of all local authority
funding to domestic and sexual
violence services was already cut
by 2012.

Labour will appoint a new
commissioner to enforce
minimum standards in tackling
domestic and sexual violence.

A Violence Against Women
Commissioner would also provide
stable central funding for women’s

109

refuges and rape crisis centres and
encourage sharing of best practice
between local authorities.

Maternity discrimination under
the Conservatives is out of control,

almost doubling in the past ten years.

Many mothers are reluctant to raise
complaints about discrimination and
unfair treatment. Unlawful maternity
and pregnancy discrimination is
now more common in Britain's
workplaces than ever before, with
54,000 pregnant women and new
mothers forced out of their jobs in
2015. Labour will reverse the unfair
employment tribunal fees which
literally price people out of justice.
Labour will also extend the time
period for applying for maternity
discrimination to the employment
tribunal from three to six months.

Labour will work with the Health
and Safety Executive to make
mandatory a workplace risk
assessment for pregnant women
so necessary adaptions can be
made, and review support for
women who have miscarriages.

110

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

LGBT EQUALITY

Labour has a proud record
of championing the fight for
LGBT equality. We abolished
Section 28, equalised the

age of consent, created civil
partnerships, and it was only
through Labour votes that
equal marriage became law.
However, there is still a long
way to go on issues such as
education, equal access to
public services, levels of LGBT
hate crime, and mental and
physical wellbeing.

A Labour government will reform

the Gender Recognition Act and the
Equality Act 2010 to ensure they
protect Trans people by changing the
protected characteristic of ‘gender
assignment to ‘gender identity’ and
remove other outdated language
such as ‘transsexual’.

CHAPTER 11 A MORE EQUAL SOCIETY,

Labour will bring the law on LGBT
hate crimes into line with hate crimes
based on race and faith, by making
them aggravated offences.

To tackle bullying of LGBT young
people, Labour will ensure that all
teachers receive initial and ongoing
training on the issues students face
and how to address them. And we
will ensure that the new guidance
for relationships and sex education
is LGBT inclusive.

Likewise, we will ensure all

frontline health and social care
professionals receive ongoing
training to understand and meet
the needs of LGBT patients and
service users. Labour will ensure
that NHS England completes the
trial programme to provide PrEP as
quickly as possible, and fully roll out
the treatment to high-risk groups to
help reduce HIV infection.

111

DIVERSE
COMMUNITIES

Now more than ever, we need
to celebrate the profound

and enriching transformation
brought by the diversity of
people in this country, with
all their different experiences,
talents and contributions.

Today Black and Asian-owned
businesses are an important and
growing feature of our economy
and society. These businesses are
important not just because of their
financial contribution; they have also
helped transform particular sectors
of the economy.

The Labour Party is the party of
equality. We seek to build a society
free from all forms of racism, anti-
Semitism and Islamophobia.

We should all be deeply troubled
by the rise in racially aggravated
attacks and race hate crime in the
past year. Anti-Semitic incidents are
also on the rise once more and we
are committed to combatting this
trend with adequate resources and
firm political will.

Commissioning a report on our own
party was an unprecedented step

in British politics, demonstrating a
commitment to tackling prejudice
wherever it is found. Labour is

112

already acting on recommendations,
including reform of internal
disciplinary procedures to make them
firmer and fairer, and expansion of
training to tackle anti-Semitism. On

a matter of such importance, Labour
urges all democratic political parties
to do the same.

We will end racism and discrimination
against Gypsy, Roma and Traveller
communities, and protect the right

to lead a nomadic way of life.

Black and Asian workers still suffer

a massive pay gap. By introducing
equal pay audit requirements on
large employers, Labour will close
this pay gap. By making the Minimum
Wage a real Living Wage, we will
benefit ethnic minority workers who
are more likely to be on low pay.

We will implement the Parker Review
recommendations to increase ethnic
diversity on the boards of Britain's
largest companies.

Last year the UN published a report
concluding that the Conservative
government had committed “grave,
systematic violations of the rights
of persons with disabilities”.

Currently 4.2 million People with
disabilities live in poverty in Britain,
and the disability employment gap
remains stubbornly high.

Labour believes in the social model
of disability - that it is society which
disables people, and it is our job to
remove those barriers. The previous
Labour government signed the UN
Convention on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities (UNCRPD). The next
Labour government will sign the
UNCRPD into UK law.

Labour will act to tackle
discrimination, remove barriers
and ensure social security delivers
dignity and empowerment, not
isolation and stigma. Labour will

A GLOBAL
BRITAIN

Labour will take all necessary
measures to protect the security
of our citizens and country. We will
put conflict resolution and human
rights at the heart of foreign
policy, commit to working through
the UN, end support for unilateral
aggressive wars of intervention
and back effective action to
alleviate the refugee crisis.

Unlike the Conservatives, Labour
believes Britain's foreign policy
should be guided by the values

of peace, universal rights and
international law. Today, these values
are being tested. As we leave the
European Union, keeping Britain
global is one of our country’s most
urgent tasks.

We face the most complex,
interwoven security and development
challenges of our time; ongoing

wars across the Middle East,
unprecedented numbers of refugees,
global terrorism, climate change,

the threat of nuclear conflict, a
devastating food crisis across East
Africa and beyond, an erratic US
administration and a more combative
government in Russia.

The lessons of the past, including
those from the Chilcot Inquiry, show

116

 

why our response to these challenges
must be different. We cannot seek

to solve the world’s problems on

our own, but instead must exhaust
diplomatic solutions alongside
international, regional and local
partners within the framework of
international law.

This will require a modern
and inclusive strategy, uniting
the interwoven foreign policy
instruments of diplomacy,
defence and development.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

DIPLOMACY

Labour recognises that, in leaving
the EU, Britain will face both
challenges and opportunities.
We are deeply ambitious for our
country’s future and will draw
on our international networks
to make Britain a champion of
multilateral engagement.

We will invest in the UK's
diplomatic services, rebuilding
some of the key capabilities

lost as a result of Tory cuts.

Since the Second World War,
Britain's most important diplomatic
relationship has been with the

US. But that special relationship

is based on shared values. When
the current Trump administration
chooses to ignore them, whether by
discriminating on the basis of religion
or breaking its climate change
commitments, we will not be afraid
to disagree.

From the Middle East to Africa, in
recent years millions of people have
been killed, injured or displaced
through wars, terrorism and military
intervention. In Syria alone, more
than 400,000 people have been killed.
Labour will work tirelessly to end

the conflict and get the diplomatic
process back on track, while fully
supporting international efforts to
investigate, prosecute and convict the
perpetrators of war crimes.

CHAPTER 12 A GLOBAL BRITAIN

 

Labour is strongly committed to
reducing human suffering caused

by war. We will publish a strategy for
protecting civilians in conflict, setting
out detailed plans for work on conflict
prevention and resolution, post-
conflict peacebuilding, and justice

for the victims of war crimes. Labour
has created a Minister for Peace and
Disarmament to lead this work.

Labour is committed to a
comprehensive peace in the Middle
East based on a two-state solution
-asecure Israel alongside a secure
and viable state of Palestine. There
can be no military solution to this
conflict and all sides must avoid
taking action that would make peace
harder to achieve. That means both
an end to the blockade, occupation
and settlements, and an end to
rocket and terror attacks. Labour will
continue to press for an immediate

117

return to meaningful negotiations
leading to a diplomatic resolution.
A Labour government will
immediately recognise the state
of Palestine.

We will also urge negotiations
towards a political resolution in all
other regions currently experiencing
conflict, including Kashmir, Libya,
Nigeria, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia
and Yemen, and give our strong
support to those countries already
working to end decades of division,
including Colombia, Cyprus and the
Democratic Republic of Congo.

In other regions, including the Korean
Peninsula and the South China Sea,
rising tensions threaten global peace.
Under a Labour government, Britain
will work to reduce those tensions
through an insistence on multilateral
political dialogue.

From Afghanistan and Iraq to

the streets of European cities,

Daesh continues to commit acts

of indiscriminate barbarism. We

will take all lawful action necessary
to counter and confront this evil,

and we will advocate a long-term
multinational political strategy, led by
regional actors, to tackle the spread
of extremism.

In our discussions with different
governments, including China,
Egypt, the Gulf States, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Russia and Turkey, we
will urge respect for human rights

118

and the rule of law. We will review
all training and equipment contracts
with repressive regimes, to ensure
that Britain never colludes in the
mistreatment of civilians.

We will always stand up for the rights,
interests and self-determination of
Britain's overseas territories and
their citizens, whether protecting the
sovereignty of the Falkland Islands
against anyone who would seek to
challenge it, or supporting the right
of the Chagos islanders to return to
their homelands.

We will reclaim Britain's leading role in
tackling climate change, working hard
to preserve the Paris Agreement and
deliver on international commitments
to reduce emissions while mitigating
the impacts of climate change on
developing countries.

While strengthening our commitment
to the UN, we also acknowledge its
shortcomings, particularly in light of
repeated abuses of the veto power by
some permanent members of the UN
Security Council. We will work with
our international partners to build
support for UN reform and make

its institutions more effective and
responsive. We will appoint dedicated
global ambassadors for women’s
rights, LGBT rights and religious
freedom to fight discrimination and
promote equality globally.

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

Exports, trade and investment play a
vital role in creating jobs and growth
in Britain, and Labour supports

the considerable contribution

that a responsible, world-leading
defence and security industry
makes to the UK economy. However,
we also believe that strong export
controls have a vital role to play in
sustaining a legitimate trade in arms,
while protecting UK jobs and R&D.
Labour will therefore implement the
Arms Trade Treaty to a consistently
high standard, including ceasing
arms exports to countries where
there is concern that they will be
used to violate international
humanitarian law (IHL).

In particular, Labour will demand a
comprehensive, independent, UN-led
investigation into alleged violations of
IHL in Yemen, including air strikes on
civilians by the Saudi-led coalition. We
will immediately suspend any further
arms sales for use in the conflict until
that investigation is concluded.

Labour remains committed to an
independent inquiry into Britain’s
military role in the 1984 raid on the
Golden Temple in Amritsar.

CHAPTER 12 A GLOBAL BRITAIN 119

DEFENCE

The primary duty of any
government is to protect and
defend its citizens. We live ina
period of growing international
tensions. A strong, viable and
sustainable defence and security
policy must be strategic and
evidence led.

As previous incoming governments
have done, a Labour government will
order a complete strategic defence
and security review when it comes
into office, to assess the emerging
threats facing Britain, including
hybrid and cyber warfare. Cyber
security will form an integral part of
our defence and security strategy
and we will introduce a cyber-security
charter for companies working with
the Ministry of Defence.

We will ensure that our armed
forces are properly equipped

and resourced to respond to
wide-ranging security challenges.
Labour will commit to effective UN
peacekeeping, including support for
a UN Emergency Peace Service.

As the security threats and challenges
we face are not bound by geographic
borders, it is vital that as Britain
leaves the EU, we maintain our close
relationship with our European
partners. Alongside our commitment
to NATO, we will continue to work

120

with the EU ona range of operational
missions to promote and support
global and regional security.

The last Labour government
consistently spent above the NATO
benchmark of 2 per cent of GDP.
Conservative spending cuts have put
Britain's security at risk, shrinking
the army to its smallest size since
the Napoleonic wars. The scrapping
of Nimrod, HMS Ark Royal and the
Harrier jump-jets have weakened
our defences and cost British
taxpayers millions.

Labour's commitment to spending at
least 2 per cent of GDP on defence
will guarantee that our Armed Forces
have the necessary capabilities to
fulfil the full range of obligations,
and ensure our conventional forces
are versatile and able to deploy ina
range of roles.

Labour supports the renewal of

the Trident nuclear deterrent. As a
nuclear-armed power, our country
has a responsibility to fulfil our
obligations under the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty. Labour will lead
multilateral efforts with international
partners and the UN to create a
nuclear-free world.

The UK defence industry is world-
leading, and Labour will continue to
support development and innovation
in this sector and to ensure that it can
continue to rely on a highly skilled

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

workforce. We are committed to a
procurement process that supports
the British steel industry and defence
manufacturing industry, which in
turn provide good jobs throughout
the supply chain. Labour will publish
a Defence Industrial Strategy

White Paper, including a National
Shipbuilding Strategy to secure a
long-term future for the industry,
workers and UK defence.

We have a duty to properly reward
and remunerate our Armed Forces.
Under the Conservatives, our Armed
Forces have been hit by rent rises,
pay restraint, and changes to tax
and benefits, putting real pressure
on service personnel and their
families. We will ensure they get the
pay and living conditions that their
service merits.

Dedicated service personnel are

at the heart of our defence policy.
Labour will immediately examine
recruitment and retention policies in
order to stem the exodus seen under
the Conservatives. We will publish
new strategic equality objectives to
ensure our personnel reflect our
diverse society.

We will drive up standards in Service
Accommodation, and take action
where private companies have failed
to deliver. We will consult with service
personnel, giving them greater

CHAPTER 12 A GLOBAL BRITAIN

autonomy over their housing choices,
and review and improve the Forces
Help to Buy scheme.

Personnel who are injured while
serving should have prompt access
to support and compensation. We
will resist any Conservative proposals
to abolish the right to seek legal
redress against the MoD where
compensation claims cannot be
otherwise settled.

We are fully committed to supporting
our veterans. We will promote
greater awareness of the Armed
Forces Covenant, seek greater
consistency in its implementation

by public authorities, and promote
increased participation in the
Corporate Covenant.

We will also roll out a Homes Fit for
Heroes programme that will insulate
the homes of disabled veterans

for free.

121

DEVELOPMENT

Labour has a proud record on
international development.

We will continue to spend

0.7 per cent of gross national
income on official development
assistance, and develop a targeted
development agenda based on
the principles of redistribution,
social justice, women’s rights and
poverty reduction.

Labour will take robust action to end
the self-regulation of Department
for International Development
private contractors, establishing and
enforcing new rules to ensure aid is
used to reduce poverty for the many,
not to increase profits for the few.

We fully support the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) agreed
globally to eradicate poverty and
protect the environment. Labour
will develop a cross-government
strategy for ensuring the SDGs are
implemented, and report annually to
Parliament on our performance.

In the wake of Brexit, to fulfil our
national obligations under the
SDGs, Labour will guarantee the
least developed countries continued
access to the UK market to protect
vital export revenues.

There are more refugees and displaced
people around the world than at any
time since the Second World War.

This is a failure of diplomacy, conflict

122

resolution and of human rights, which
is why they will be at the heart of
Labour's foreign policy.

The Conservatives have completely
failed to show any leadership on
this issue. In the first 100 days of
government, we will produce a
cross-departmental strategy to meet
our international obligations on the
refugee crisis.

The current global tax system is
deeply unjust. Africa’s economies
alone lose more than £46 billion
annually through corruption and tax
evasion - more than 10 times what
they receive in aid. Labour will act
decisively on tax havens, introducing
strict standards of transparency for
crown dependencies and overseas
territories, including a public
register of owners, directors, major
shareholders and beneficial owners
for all companies and trusts.

We will work in partnership with
communities in the Global South
to develop long-term strategies
for strengthening economies and
societies. We would reinstate the
Civil Society Challenge Fund to
support trade unions, women’s
associations and other civil society
organisations which are the most
effective forces in winning human
rights and workers’ rights.

Jobs in global supply chains can
be of enormous importance to
working people across the Global

FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW

 

South, but human rights abuses and
exploitation of lower environmental
standards and workers’ rights are
too common. Labour is committed to
ensuring respect for human rights,
workers’ rights and environmental
sustainability in the operations of
British businesses around the world,
and we will work to tighten the rules
governing corporate accountability
for abuses in global supply chains.

Labour will work with business to
ensure the provisions of the Modern
Slavery Act are fully respected,
including reporting on due diligence
in supply chains. We will extend

the remit of the Groceries Code
Adjudicator beyond direct suppliers
to ensure fair treatment for all those
producing goods for the UK’s largest
supermarkets.

CHAPTER 12 A GLOBAL BRITAIN

At least a billion people around
the world cannot currently obtain
the health services they need, and
another 100 million are pushed
below the poverty line as a result
of paying for their services. We will
establish a Centre for Universal
Health Coverage, providing

global partnerships, support and
encouragement to countries that
want UHC, helping them to generate
the funding and systems required
for its delivery.

We will invest in new public-health
driven research and development
to find effective and affordable
treatments for diseases in the
developing world, including fighting
TB, malaria, HIV/AIDS and neglected
tropical diseases.

FOREWORD

This election will shape our country for
a generation. It is your opportunity to
transform our country, so that it works
not just for a few, but for all of us. It

is a chance to deliver the real change
Britain needs. This manifesto sets out
how a Labour government will do that.

Some people say this is the Brexit
election. But it’s also the climate
election, the investment election, the
HS election, the living standards
election, the education election, the
poverty election, the fair taxes election.
Above all, it’s the change election.

it’s time to take on the vested interests
holding people back. The last decade
has seen a wealth grab by a privileged
few, supported by the Conservatives,
at the expense of the majority. The

big polluters, financial speculators and
corporate tax-dodgers have had a free
ride for too long.

Labour will build a fairer Britain that
cares for all, where wealth and power
are shared.

 

am not prepared to continue to see
more families without a proper home
and more people queuing at food banks
or sleeping rough on the streets.

| am not prepared to put up

with communities blighted by lack
of investment, endless cuts to vital
services and millions struggling to

make ends meet, while tax cuts are
handed to the richest.

We can do better than this. How can

it be right that in the fifth richest
country in the world, people’s living
standards are going backwards and life
expectancy is stalling?

The Conservative Government is failing.
It has failed on the economy, on the
climate crisis, on investment for the
future, on public services and on Brexit.
It is simply not working for most people.

A Labour government will unlock the
potential of all those held back for too
long. Labour will be on your side.

Labour will rewrite the rules of the
economy, so that it works for everyone.
We will rebuild our public services, by
taxing those at the top to properly fund
the services we all rely on.

We will launch the largest-scale
investment programme in modern
times to fund the jobs and industries of
the future, so that no one is held back
and no community left behind. This is a
fully costed programme to upgrade our
economy and transform our country.

We will kick-start a Green Industrial
Revolution to tackle the climate
emergency by shifting to renewable
energy, investing in rail and electric
cars, and making housing energy-
efficient, to reduce fuel poverty and
excess winter deaths.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

 

We will create a million climate jobs

in every region and nation of the

UK - good, skilled jobs that will bring
prosperity back to parts of our country
neglected for too long.

We will bring rail, mail, water and energy
into public ownership to end the great
privatisation rip-off and save you
money on your fares and bills.

We will deliver full-fibre broadband
free to everybody in every home in
our country by creating a new public
service, boosting the economy,
connecting communities and putting
money back in your pocket.

FOREWORD

We will end food bank Britain, and lift
children and pensioners out of poverty.

We will bring in a Real Living Wage of
at least £10 per hour for all workers

- with equal rights at work from day
one on the job. We will end insecurity
and exploitation by ending zero-hours
contracts and strengthening trade
union rights.

Labour will create a National Education
Service to provide support and
opportunity throughout your life: from
Sure Start centres to top-quality early
years education; well-funded schools
with lower class sizes to free university

tuition with no fees; and free lifelong
learning, giving you the chance to
reskill throughout your life.

Labour will give the NHS the funding

it needs, end privatisation, and never
let our health service be up for grabs in
any trade negotiation. We'll expand our
NHS to offer free prescriptions for all
and free basic dentistry, building on its
founding principles.

We will end the social care crisis that
has left 1.5 million elderly people
without the care they need. Labour will
fund free personal care for older people
and extra care packages.

I'm really worried by the rise in crime

— and the fact that the most serious
violent crime has risen even further. We
will reverse a decade of cuts to police
and vital public services that have
shown you simply can’t keep people
safe on the cheap.

Labour will protect our security at home
and abroad. After years of failed foreign
interventions and wars, we will end the
‘bomb first, talk later’ approach and
instead have a foreign policy based on
peace, justice and human rights.

And we will get Brexit sorted in six
months by giving people the final

say - with a choice between a sensible
leave deal or remain. We will implement
whatever the British people decide.

The choice could not be clearer at this
election. Labour will put wealth and

power in the hands of the many. Boris
Johnson's Conservatives will look after
the privileged few.

This manifesto offers the chance of

real change for every generation and
every community. When Labour wins,
the nurse wins, the pensioner wins, the
student wins, the office worker wins, the
engineer wins. We all win.

We can and we must do better
as a country.

This is our last chance to tackle
the climate emergency.

The future is ours to make. It’s time for
real change - for the many, not the few.
Together, we can deliver it.

of

Jeremy Corbyn
Leader of the Labour Party

 

This manifesto deals both with Labour's
policies which apply across the United
Kingdom and, where responsibilities
have been devolved, it also sets out

our policies for England.

In devolved areas such as health,
education and local government,
Labour's detailed policies for
Scotland and Wales are set out
in the manifestos published by
our Welsh and Scottish parties.

This election is

about the crisis

of living standards
and the climate

and environmental
emergency. Whether
we are ready or not,
we stand on the brink

of unstoppable change.

AGREEN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION

 

We must confront this change while dealing with
the growing inequality and insecurity in Britain.
Labour led the UK Parliament in declaring a climate
and environmental emergency. The next Labour
government will lead the world in fighting it, with a
plan to drive up living standards by transforming our
economy into one low in carbon, rich in good jobs,
radically fairer and more democratic.

The climate crisis ties us all into a common fate. This
election is our best hope to protect future generations
from an uninhabitable planet. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change has said we need to cut
global emissions in half by 2030 to have a chance of
keeping global heating within safe limits - that means
acting now, and acting decisively.

The Tories wasted a decade serving the interests of
big polluters. Labour will use the crucial next decade
to act. The Tories slashed support for renewable
energy while pushing through dangerous fracking.

Now Britain is decades off course on
vital emissions targets.

That’s why Labour will kick-start a Green
Industrial Revolution that will create one
million jobs in the UK to transform our
industry, energy, transport, agriculture
and our buildings, while restoring
nature. Our Green New Deal aims to
achieve the substantial majority of our
emissions reductions by 2030 in a way
that is evidence-based, just and that
delivers an economy that serves the
interests of the many, not the few.

Just as the original Industrial Revolution
brought industry, jobs and pride to

our towns, Labour’s world-leading
Green Industrial Revolution will rebuild
them, with more rewarding, well-paid
jobs, lower energy bills and whole

new industries to revive parts of our
country that have been neglected for
too long. For some, industrial transition
has become a byword for devastation,
because successive Conservative
governments were content to sit back
and leave the fate of whole industries
and communities at the mercy of
market forces. A Labour government
will never let that happen.

We will work in partnership with the
workforce and their trade unions

in every sector of our economy, so
that they lead the transition in their
industries, creating new, good-quality
jobs and making sure that their

extensive skills are passed on to
the next generation of workers.

We will show the world how prioritising
sustainability will not only deliver
immediate improvements to everyone’s
lives but also offer humanity a pathway
to a more equitable and enlightened
economy: one that protects our
environment, reins in corporate power,
revitalises democracy, unites our
communities, builds international
solidarity and promises a better quality
of life for all. The scale of the challenge
requires nothing less.

Tackling the destruction of our planet
is a question of justice - for the
communities at home and abroad
who are most affected by it and

for our children who will bear the
consequences if we don't. Social justice
will define Labour’s approach. We will
make sure that the costs of the green
transition fall fairly and are mostly
borne by the wealthy and those most
responsible for the problem.

2019 saw the blossoming of a global
movement calling on politicians to
wake up and act on the climate and
environmental emergency. Labour
welcomed that movement and, as a
government in waiting, we have turned
its demands into detailed, credible
plans for real change.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

Investment

Delivering the far-reaching change
needed to tackle the climate and
environmental emergency will require a
full mobilisation of national resources,
both public and private.

Labour will create a Sustainable
Investment Board to bring together
the Chancellor, Business Secretary and
Bank of England Governor to oversee,
co-ordinate and bring forward this
investment - involving trade unions
and business. We will ask the Office for
Budget Responsibility to incorporate
climate and environmental impacts
into its forecasts so that the cost of not
acting will be factored into every

fiscal decision.

The cost of not acting is far greater
than the cost of acting. We will launch
a National Transformation Fund of
£400 billion and rewrite the Treasury’s
investment rules to guarantee that
every penny spent is compatible with
our climate and environmental targets
~ and that the costs of not acting are
fully accounted for too. Of this, £250
billion will directly fund the transition
through a Green Transformation Fund
dedicated to renewable and low-carbon
energy and transport, biodiversity and
environmental restoration.

We will create a National Investment
Bank, backed up by a network of
Regional Development Banks, to
provide £250 billion of lending

for enterprise, infrastructure and
innovation over 10 years. They will

AGREEN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION

be mandated to lend in line with our
mission to decarbonise our economy
while increasing productivity and
creating good jobs across the country.
As well as large-scale national and
regional projects, smaller loans will

be available through our new Post
Bank based in Post Office branches,
enabling thousands of bottom-up
transformational changes by start-ups,
small businesses, local co-operatives
and community projects in towns and
villages up and down the country.

We will make sure that the Uk’s
financial sector is helping to tackle the
emergency rather than fuelling it. We
will do this by improving the fitness

of our financial authorities to mobilise
green investment and by giving them
powers to manage the risk to financial
stability posed by short-sighted
investment in polluting assets.

Just 100 companies globally are
responsible for the majority of carbon
emissions. We won't be afraid to tackle
this wanton corporate destruction by
taking on the powerful interests that are
causing climate change. We will change
the criteria a company must meet to be
listed on the London Stock Exchange
so that any company that fails to
contribute to tackling the climate and
environmental emergency is delisted.

Levelling Up Across the Country

Many parts of Britain would need

this investment even without a climate
and environmental emergency. Years
of under-investment and neglect

by Westminster have left too many
communities feeling powerless and
too many areas left behind with low-
quality jobs, weak productivity and
slow growth.

The climate and environmental
emergency is a chance to unite the
country to face this common challenge
by mobilising all our national resources,
both financial and human. But we will
only succeed by ensuring that everyone
shares in the benefits. Labour will make
sure that investment is spread evenly
across the whole country and will give
powers and funding to every region and
nation of the UK.

We will bring about a radical
decentralisation of power in Britain so
that local people and communities are
given far greater control over their own
lives and prospects.

A Local Transformation Fund in each
English region will be used exclusively
to fund infrastructure projects decided
at a local level, as will devolved
governments in Wales, Scotland

and Northern Ireland. Our Regional
Development Banks will be governed
by boards made up of key local
stakeholders such as local chambers of
commerce, trade unions and councillors
- with Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland empowered to make similar

4

arrangements. They will set priorities for
lending, giving every region and nation
a new and powerful lever to rebuild their
economy on their own terms.

We will shift the political centre

of gravity by placing the National
Transformation Fund Unit, a key part of
the Treasury, in the North of England
and build up the regional offices of
government in each of the nine English
regions to co-ordinate government
policies at the regional level, as well as
ensuring a regional voice in Whitehall.

Energy

Energy use in buildings accounts for
56% of the Uk’s total emissions, making
it the single most polluting sector. We
will develop the recommendations

of our ‘30 by 2030’ report to put the
UK on track for a net-zero-carbon
energy system within the 2030s - and
go faster if credible pathways can

be found. We will deliver nearly 90%
of electricity and 50% of heat from
renewable and low-carbon sources

by 2030.

We will build:
+ 7,000 new offshore wind turbines
+ 2,000 new onshore wind turbines

+ Enough solar panels to cover 22,000
football pitches.

+ New nuclear power needed for energy
security.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

We will trial and expand tidal energy
and invest to reduce the costs of
renewable and low-carbon hydrogen
production. We will upgrade almost

all of the Uk’s 27 million homes to the
highest energy-efficiency standards,
reducing the average household energy
bill by £417 per household per year by
2030 and eliminating fuel poverty. We
will introduce a zero-carbon homes
standard for all new homes.

As part of heat decarbonisation, we will
roll out technologies like heat pumps,
solar hot water and hydrogen, and
invest in district heat networks using
waste heat.

To balance the grid, we will expand
power storage and invest in grid
enhancements and interconnectors.

We will expand distributed and
community energy, and immediately
and permanently ban fracking.

We will support energy workers
through transition and guarantee them
retraining and a new, unionised job on
equivalent terms and conditions.

We will introduce a windfall tax on oil
companies, so that the companies that
knowingly damaged our climate will
help cover the costs. We will provide a
strategy to safeguard the people, jobs
and skills that depend on the offshore
oil and gas industry.

AGREEN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION

Ownership

We will not achieve the promise of a fair
and sustainable economy if we repeat
the mistakes of the carbon era, when
the capture of a natural resource for
private profit created a vastly unequal
and polluting economy dominated by
powerful vested interests.

It’s not just carbon. From the
depletion of fish stocks to the
burning of the Amazon, profit has
proved a poor regulator for use of
our natural resources.

Whether it is the trillions of litres of
water lost through leakages, barriers to
renewable energy connecting to the
grid or the billions of pounds of bill-
payers’ money being siphoned off in
dividends to wealthy shareholders,
Tory privatisation of our utilities has
been a disaster for both our planet and
our wallets.

We will put people and planet before
profit by bringing our energy and

water systems into democratic public
ownership. In public hands, energy and
water will be treated as rights rather than
commodities, with any surplus reinvested
or used to reduce bills. Communities
themselves will decide, because utilities
won't be run from Whitehall but by
service-users and workers.

Public ownership will secure democratic
control over nationally strategic
infrastructure and provide collective
stewardship for key natural resources.

In the case of energy, it will also help
deliver Labour's ambitious emissions
targets. Whereas private network
companies have failed to upgrade the
grid at the speed and scale needed,
publicly owned networks will accelerate
and co-ordinate investment to connect
renewable and low-carbon energy while
working with energy unions to support
energy workers through the transition.

Under Labour's plans:

+ Anew UK National Energy Agency will
own and maintain the national grid
infrastructure and oversee the delivery
of our decarbonisation targets.

+ 14 new Regional Energy Agencies
will replace the existing district
network operators and hold statutory
responsibility for decarbonising
electricity and heat and reducing
fuel poverty.

+The supply arms of the Big Six energy
companies will be brought into public
ownership where they will continue to
supply households with energy while
helping them to reduce their
energy demands.

The Conservatives allowed the
proceeds of North Sea oil to be
squandered on tax cuts for the richest
and captured in profits for the few,
instead of investing them in our future.
We now stand at an even greater
crossroads in the development of our
national economy. Under Labour, our
green future will be owned by all of us.

Whenever public money is invested

in an energy generation project, the
public sector will take a stake and return
profits to the public.

Industry and Innovation

Averting climate catastrophe offers
huge economic opportunities.

But Britain will only benefit from

a Green Industrial Revolution with
the right policies.

Over the past three decades, Britain has
reduced its emissions at the expense

of domestic industry by offshoring
production. This is an accounting trick,
not a solution. It does not protect the
climate, is unfair to other countries

and it damages jobs and communities
at home.

Labour will take full responsibility for our
carbon footprint instead of passing the
buck. We will instruct the Committee

on Climate Change to assess the
emissions the UK imports as well as
those it produces, and recommend
policies to tackle them, including making
UK industry the greenest in the world.

The Conservatives have presided over a
lost decade of productivity and allowed
Britain to fall behind in the green
technologies of the future. Labour will
make sure this never happens again.

Targeted science, research and
innovation will be crucial to tackling the
climate crisis, dealing with the plastic

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

waste filling our oceans and addressing
other societal challenges, such as

an ageing population and antibiotic
resistance. As part of our plan to usher
in a Green Industrial Revolution, Labour
will create an innovation nation, setting
a target for 3% of GDP to be spent on
research and development (R&D) by
2030. We will achieve this target by
increasing direct support for R&D and
reforming the innovation ecosystem to
better ‘crowd in’ private investment.

We will establish a Foundation
Industries Sector Council to provide

a clean and long-term future for our
existing heavy industries like steel

and glass and fund R&D into newer
technologies like hydrogen and carbon
capture and storage.

A thriving steel industry will be vital

to the Green Industrial Revolution.
Labour will support our steel through
public procurement, taking action on
industrial energy prices, exempting new
capital from business rates, investing

in R&D, building three new steel
recycling plants and upgrading existing
production sites.

We will ensure that new technologies
aren't just invented here, but are
engineered, manufactured and
exported from here. We will put
British innovation at the heart of

our procurement to support local
sourcing and reshoring, so that every
investment we make strengthens
our manufacturing and engineering

AGREEN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION

sectors and supply chains and creates
hundreds of thousands of good,
unionised jobs here at home.

We will use the power of public
procurement to strengthen local jobs
and supply chains and will require all
companies bidding for public contracts
to recognise trade unions, pay suppliers
on time and demonstrate equalities
best practice.

As we transition, we will ensure the UK’s
automotive sector isn’t left behind by
the electric revolution by investing in
three new gigafactories and four metal
reprocessing plants. By supporting
UkK-made electrical steel we will ensure
robust support for an end to end UK
supply chain. We'll also take on the
global plastics crisis by investing in a
new plastics remanufacturing industry
creating thousands of jobs, ending
exports of plastic waste and reducing
our contribution to ocean pollution.

Labour's progressive trade strategy will
be aligned with our industrial strategy
to help develop the industrial base
needed to deliver high-quality exports
and the decent jobs that go with them.
Labour will champion exports from

the environmental goods and services
sector, building on the 300,000 jobs
that the sector already sustains. We
will uphold the highest environmental
and social regulations in all our trade
relations, and will never downgrade
standards as ‘barriers’ to trade.

Skills

Our Green Industrial Revolution will
create at least one million well-paid,
unionised jobs in the UK. We will train
people in the skills they need to access
these jobs of the future.

Britain’s skills crisis has grown under

the Tories. The Apprenticeship Levy

has been beset by problems, leaving
employers paying into a training budget
they are unable to spend. And it is

not delivering for small businesses.

We cannot afford to carry on like this.

Labour will make it easier for employers
to spend the levy by allowing it to be
used for a wider range of accredited
training, in line with guidelines set by
the Institute for Apprenticeships and
Technical Education and government's
wider priorities for the economy.

We will launch a Climate Apprenticeship
programme to enable employers to
develop the skills needed to lead the
world in clean technology.

Under this programme, employers

will be expected to allocate 25% of
the funds in their Apprenticeship

Levy accounts to training Climate
Apprentices. These funds can be spent
directly or allocated to a ring-fenced
Climate Apprenticeship Fund, which

will be topped up with any surplus
raised through Inclusive Ownership
Funds and made accessible to non-
levy-paying businesses.

Targeted bursaries will be available to
women, BAME people, care leavers,
ex-armed forces personnel, and people
with disabilities to encourage them to
take up climate apprenticeships - the
STEM of the future.

We will further help small businesses
by increasing the amount that can
be transferred to non-levy-paying
employers to 50% and introducing
an online matching service to help
levy-paying businesses find smaller
businesses to transfer their funds to.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

TRANSPORT

Labour will build a
sustainable, affordable,
accessible and integrated
transport system,
founded on the principle
that transport is an
essential public service.

AGREEN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION

 

Cutting emissions will drive our transport policies. We
will review public expenditure on transport to ensure
that it promotes environmental sustainability and
contributes to decarbonisation.

Bus services have been devastated by the
Conservatives, despite carrying more people than any
other mode of public transport. Women are especially
dependent on buses, which also provide a lifeline

for both older and younger people and for many
economically disadvantaged groups.

Labour will ensure that councils can improve bus
services by regulating and taking public ownership

of bus networks, and we will give them resources

and full legal powers to achieve this cost-effectively,
thereby ending the race to the bottom in working
conditions for bus workers. Where councils take control
of their buses, Labour will introduce free bus travel for
under-25s. We will increase and expand local services,

reinstating the 3,000 routes that have
been cut, particularly hitting rural
communities.

Labour will deliver improvements for

rail passengers by bringing our railways
back into public ownership, using
options including franchise expiry. This
will enable us to make fares simpler and
more affordable, rebuild the fragmented
railways as a nationally integrated
public service, cut the wastage of
private profit, improve accessibility for
disabled people, ensure safe staffing
levels and end driver-only operation.

Our publicly owned rail company

will steer network planning and
investments. It will co-ordinate
mainline upgrades, resignalling,
rolling stock replacement and major
projects. We will implement a full,
rolling programme of electrification.
Our model will ensure continuity of
skills, jobs and supply chain capacity
to reduce costs, improve productivity
and support the economic benefits of
Labour’s Green Industrial Revolution.

We will introduce a long-term
investment plan including delivering
Crossrail for the North as part of
improved connectivity across the
northern regions. We will consult with
local communities to reopen branch
lines. We will also unlock capacity
and extend high-speed rail networks
nationwide by completing the full
HS2 route to Scotland, taking full
account of the environmental impacts
of different route options. We will

20

deliver rail electrification and expansion
across the whole country, including in
Wales. We will ensure that these major
infrastructure projects are a model

of good employment practice and

pay due regard to the environmental
impact.

We will promote the use of rail freight
in order to reduce carbon emissions, air
pollutants and congestion on the roads
and expand the provision of publicly
owned rail freight services.

We will increase the funding available
for cycling and walking. We will bring
together transport and land-use
planning to create towns and cities

in which walking and cycling are the
best choice: safe, accessible, healthy,
efficient, economical and pollution-
free. We will help children’s health and
well-being by ensuring street designs
provide freedom for physically active
outdoor play and by introducing
measures to ensure the zones around
our schools are safer, with cleaner air.

Our transport programme is focused on
creating better, publicly accessible local
transport systems. By improving public
transport, Labour will help people to
become less reliant on their cars, for our
better health, for a cleaner environment
and to improve quality of life in our
towns and cities. The Conservatives
have committed to ending new sales of
combustion engine vehicles by 2040.
Labour will aim for 2030.

We will position the UK at the forefront
of the development and manufacture

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

of ultra-low emission vehicles and will
support their sale. We will invest in
electric vehicle charging infrastructure
and in electric community car clubs.
We will accelerate the transition of our
public sector car fleets and our public
buses to zero-emissions vehicles.

We will reform taxi and private hire
services, including a review of licensing
authority jurisdictions, setting national
minimum standards of safety and
accessibility and updating regulations
to keep pace with technological change
and to close loopholes to ensure a level
playing field.

We will adopt an ambitious

Vision Zero approach to UK road
safety, striving for zero deaths and
serious injuries. Labour will invest

to make our neglected local roads,
pavements and cycleways safer for
the everyday journeys of both drivers
and vulnerable road users. We will
review all tolled crossings.

Labour recognises the Davies
Commission's assessment of pressures
on airport capacity in the South East.
Any expansion of airports must pass
our tests on air quality, noise pollution,
climate change obligations and
countrywide benefits. We will examine
fiscal and regulatory options to ensure
a response to the climate crisis in a way
that is fair to consumers and protects
the economy.

We will take action to end nationality-
based discrimination in seafarer pay.

We are facing a climate and environment emergency,
and unlike the Tories we will not trade our environment
in pursuit of reckless trade agreements.

Labour will review and improve protected area
designations, from National Parks to local nature
reserves and urban green spaces.

We will introduce a Climate and Environment
Emergency Bill setting out in law robust, binding
new standards for decarbonisation, nature recovery,
environmental quality and habitats and species
protection.

We will maintain and continuously improve the
existing EU standards of environmental regulation.

AHealthy Environment

Our polluted air contributes to over 40,000 premature
deaths a year and poisons our environment, with

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

further impacts on children’s health. But
the Conservatives’ air-quality measures
are so inadequate they have been
found to be illegal.

Labour will introduce a new Clean Air
Act, with a vehicle scrappage scheme
and clean air zones, complying with
World Health Organisation limits for
fine particles and nitrous oxides.

We will provide an extra £5.6 billion
in funding to improve the standard
of flood defences and respond

to the increased risk of flooding,
prioritising areas at risk in North
West England, Yorkshire and the East
Midlands that have been neglected
by Conservative investments.

Nature Restoration

Our Plan for Nature will set legally
binding targets to drive the restoration
of species and habitats.

We will embark on an ambitious
programme of tree planting, with both
forestry and native woodland species.

We will fully fund the Environment
Agency and other frontline environment
agencies, and improve upstream

river management.

We will create new National Parks
alongside a revised system of other
protected area designations, which
will guard existing wildlife sites and
join up important habitats, while also
ensuring more people can enjoy living
closer to nature.

AGREEN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION

We will establish a new environmental
tribunal to ensure that administrative
decisions are consistent with
environmental and nature-recovery
obligations.

Land

Land is a public good, but it is nota
common asset. In 1979, 20% of land
was owned by the public sector.
Today, that has halved.

Green Belts protect one tenth of our
land and offer conservation of some

of our natural environment. Introduced
by Labour in 1947 to provide access

to the countryside, they are threatened
by developments.

A Labour government will maintain
agricultural and rural structural funds
but repurpose them to support
environmental land management
and sustainable methods of food
production.

We will invest in more county farms to
replace those lost, and will work with
agricultural organisations to increase
access into farming for new entrants.

Food

A quarter of all food purchased is
wasted every year, equivalent to over
20 million tonnes of greenhouse gas
emissions, costing over £20 billion.

Yet Britain has an epidemic in food-
related ill health, obesity, malnutrition

and diabetes, as well as increased food
insecurity - with a boom in food bank
use and record levels of hunger.

Labour will introduce A Right to Food.
We will end ‘food bank Britain’ We will
ensure everyone has access to healthy,
nutritious, sustainably produced food.
We will halve food bank usage within

a year and remove the need for them
altogether in three years. We will
establish a National Food Commission
and review the Allotments Act. We

will make food security a reason to
intervene in the economy and work with
local councils to minimise food waste

We will put farmers, fishers, food
producers and workers at the heart

of our plans for delivering healthy

food locally. We will support local

food networks, expand access to

farm holdings and ensure rights of
union representation for all food and
agricultural workers. We will re-establish
an Agricultural Wages Board in England
so every part of the UK is covered.

We will set maximum sustainable
yields for all shared fish stocks,
redistribute fish quotas along
social and environmental criteria
and, if people vote to leave the EU,
require the majority of fish caught
under a UK quota to be landed in
UK ports.

We aim to achieve net-zero-carbon
food production in Britain by 2040.

24

Waste and Recycling

Waste, including plastic waste, pollutes
our land and seas, killing wildlife and
contaminating our food.

We will make producers responsible
for the waste they create and for

the full cost of recycling or disposal,
encouraging more sustainable design
and manufacturing. In government in
Wales, Labour has transformed the
position of recycling, placing them in
the top five globally for recycling rates.
A UK Labour government will learn
from Wales’ example, and will also
back bottle-return schemes.

We will invest in three new recyclable
steel plants in areas with a proud history
of steel manufacturing.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

The Conservatives will

sacrifice animal welfare
standards in trade deals
with other countries.
They threaten to bring
back fox hunting and are
pursuing the ineffective
badger cull - the

largest destruction of

a protected species in
living memory.

AGREEN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION

 

Labour has published an ambitious animal welfare
manifesto which reiterates our commitments to
prohibit foxhunting and end the cull of badgers.

In England, we will introduce an animal welfare
commissioner, prohibit the sale of snares and glue
traps, end the badger cull and ban the keeping of
primates as pets. We will work internationally to end
commercial whaling, ban the importation of hunting
trophies of threatened species, and boost police
resources to tackle rural and wildlife crime.

Universal public services,
collectively provided
through general taxation
and free at the point of
use for all, are how we
guarantee the right toa
good life.

REBUILD OUR PUBLIC SERVICES

 

Public services do more than make sure everyone

has the basics. They create shared experiences and
strengthen social bonds. They make our lives richer and
more fulfilling.

A decade of Tory cuts has pushed our public services
to breaking point. Labour offers real change - we

will make Britain’s public services the best and most
extensive in the world.

We will pay for this by creating a fairer taxation system,
asking for a little more from those with the broadest
shoulders, and making sure that everyone pays what
they owe.

We will reverse some of the Tories’ cuts to corporation
tax while keeping rates lower than in 2010.

We'll ask those who earn more than £80,000 a year to
pay a little more income tax, while freezing National
Insurance and income tax rates for everyone else.

29

We will end the unfairness that sees
income from wealth taxed at lower
rates than income from work. VAT is

a regressive tax that hits the poorest
hardest and we guarantee no increases
in VAT.

We will launch the biggest ever
crackdown on tax avoidance and
evasion and reform the inefficient
system of tax reliefs.

Public services must also be
accountable. Labour will end the
current presumption in favour of
outsourcing public services and
introduce a presumption in favour of
insourcing. And we will stop the public
getting ripped off by taking back all
PFI contracts over time.

When services are procured from

the private sector, companies will be
assessed against best practice public
service criteria, including provisions
for collective bargaining, fair wage
clauses, adherence to environmental
standards, effective equalities policies,
full tax compliance and application of
pay ratios. In the public sector, we will
enforce maximum pay ratios of 20:1.

We will repair the damage the Tories
have done to our social fabric, with

a £150 billion Social Transformation
Fund to replace, upgrade and expand
our schools, hospitals, care homes and
council houses. Public buildings will be
modernised to ensure a reduction in
their carbon footprint.

30

Our most valuable assets are the
dedicated people who work in

our public services, but under this
government their pay has been cut in
real terms. Labour will restore public
sector pay to at least pre-financial
crisis levels (in real terms), by delivering
year-on-year above-inflation pay rises,
starting with a 5% increase, to reward
and retain the people who do so much
for us all.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

The National Health
Service is one of Labour’s

proudest achievements.
The right to free-at-
the-point-of-use
healthcare, universal and
comprehensive in scope,

is socialism in action.

REBUILD OUR PUBLIC SERVICES

 

A decade of Tory health cuts and privatisations has
pushed our greatest institution to the brink. Our
hospitals are crumbling, equipment is outdated, IT
systems are inadequate and community facilities
are neglected.

There are 100,000 staff vacancies in NHS England,
including a shortage of 43,000 nurses. There are
15,000 fewer hospital beds. Every winter, bed
occupancy rates exceed dangerous levels. Patients
now wait far too long to see their GP, for an ambulance
or for treatment.

Our immediate task is to repair our health services.
Our urgent priority is to end NHS privatisation.

Our mission is to create the conditions to prevent
illness and enable people to live longer, healthier lives.

31

Quality Care for All

A Labour government will invest in the
NHS to give patients the modern, well-
resourced services they need. We will
increase expenditure across the health
sector by an average 4.3% a year. This
investment enables us to end patient
charges, guarantee the standards of
healthcare patients are entitled to
receive from NHS England, invest in
education for the health workforce and
restore public health grants.

Our investments mean we deliver the
standards of care enshrined in the NHS.
We will stabilise our overstretched A&E
departments. We will improve stroke,
heart disease and cancer survival rates
by providing earlier diagnosis and
improved screening rates. We will call a
moratorium on bed cuts.

Every penny spent on privatisation and
outsourcing is a penny less spent on
patient care. Labour will end and reverse
privatisation in the NHS in the next
Parliament. We will repeal the Health
and Social Care Act and reinstate the
responsibilities of the Secretary of
State to provide a comprehensive and
universal healthcare system. We will end
the requirement on health authorities to
put services out to competitive tender.
We will ensure services are delivered
in-house and also bring subsidiary
companies back in-house. We will halt
the fire sale of NHS land and assets.

We will publish an infrastructure plan to

 

return NHS England to the international
average level of capital investment

32

and to ensure future decisions are
transparent and balanced fairly
between every region. We will complete
the confirmed hospital rebuilds and
invest more in primary care settings,
modern Al, cyber technology and
state-of-the-art medical equipment,
including more MRI and CT scanners.

We will ensure data protection for

NHS and patient information, a highly
valuable publicly funded resource that
can be used for better diagnosis of
conditions and for ground-breaking
research. We will ensure NHS data is not
exploited by international technology
and pharmaceutical corporations.

We will uphold the principle of
comprehensive healthcare by providing
free annual NHS dental check-ups.
We will guarantee universal healthcare
by ensuring women’s and children’s
health services are comprehensive,

by protecting the rights of EU workers,
other migrants and refugees and by
ensuring all our services are made
accessible to BAME, LGBT+ and
disabled patients. We will end
mixed-sex wards.

We will ensure our NHS becomes a net-
zero-carbon service with an NHS Forest
of one million trees, more efficient
heating and insulation systems, greater
reliance on renewable energy, including
more solar panelling and a transition to
electric paramedic vehicles, NHS fleet
cars and hybrid ambulances.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

We will introduce mandatory standards
for NHS in-patient food and will provide
free hospital parking for patients, staff
and visitors.

Joined-up Care

As medical technologies advance,
we will live with a wider array of
chronic conditions. Health and care
must become more joined-up, more
accessible, more personal and more
preventative.

We will stop Tory plans to further
entrench the private sector delivery

of health care under the cover of
integration plans set out in the NHS
Long Term Plan. Instead we will join up,
integrate and co-ordinate care through
public bodies.

A Labour government will develop a
planned model of joined-up community
care, enabling people to live longer lives
in better health in their own homes. We
will ensure the voices of local people
and NHS staff are heard in future
developments of the health system.

We will allocate a greater proportion of
overall funding to close-to-home health
services and build interdisciplinary,
patient-focused services across
primary care, mental health and social
care. We will ensure patients in deprived
and remote communities will have
better access to primary care services.
We will also ensure those living with
long-term conditions can access the
care they need.

REBUILD OUR PUBLIC SERVICES

To support our transition to community
health care services, we will expand GP
training places to provide resources for
27 million more appointments each year
and ensure community pharmacy is
supported.

Mental Health

A Labour government will provide
an additional £16 billion a year to
ensure new standards for mental
health are enshrined in the NHS
constitution ensuring access to
treatments is on a par with that
for physical health conditions.

Our mental health hospitals are not fit
for purpose. Over 1,000 people with
mental health problems face hospital
stays in old, dormitory-style hospital
wards, while less than one in four

A&E departments have the facilities
to deal with people experiencing a
mental health crisis. We will invest

£2 billion to modernise hospital facilities
and end the use of inappropriate,
out-of-area placements.

The legislation for detaining people
with learning disabilities and mental
illnesses is outdated. We will implement
in full the recommendations set out in
the independent review of the Mental
Health Act, so that people are given
choice, autonomy and the treatment
they need.

We will invest more in eating disorders
services and ensure NICE guidelines on
eating disorders are implemented.

33

We will improve access to psychological
therapies to ensure they deliver the
quality care patients deserve. We will
ensure provision of 24/7 crisis services.

Only one in four children and young
people are able to receive help from a
mental health professional. Our £845
million plan for Healthy Young Minds will
more than double the annual spending
on children and adolescent mental
health services.

We will establish a network of open-
access mental health hubs to enable
more children to access mental health
and recruit almost 3,500 qualified
counsellors to guarantee every child
access to school counsellors.

Inequalities

Life expectancy is stalling and infant
mortality rates are increasing, especially
among those living in our most deprived
communities.

A Labour government will target a
reduction in health inequalities with

a comprehensive children’s health
strategy. We will introduce a Future
Generations Well-being Act, enshrining
health aims in all policies and a new
duty for NHS agencies to collaborate
with directors of public health.

We will invest more than £1 billion in
public health and recruit 4,500 more
health visitors and school nurses. We
will increase mandated health visits,
ensure new mothers can have access to

34

breastfeeding support and

introduce mental health assessments
in a maternal health check six weeks
after birth.

We will invest in children’s oral health,
tackle childhood obesity and extend
the sugar tax to milk drinks. We will
ban fast-food restaurants near schools
and enforce stricter rules around the
advertising of junk food and levels of
salt in food. We will take actions to
significantly reduce infant deaths and
ensure families who lose a baby receive
appropriate bereavement support as
well as protections at work.

The re-emergence of measles is an
indictment. We will urgently put in place
a vaccination action plan to regain our
measles-free status in WHO listings.

We will fully fund sexual health services
and roll out PrEP medication.

We will address drug-related deaths,
alcohol-related health problems and
the adverse impacts of gambling

as matters of public health, treated
accordingly in expanded addiction-
support services. Alcoholic drinks will
be labelled with clear health warnings.
We will review the evidence on
minimum pricing.

We will implement a Tobacco
Control Plan and fund smoking
cessation services.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

Workforce

A Labour government will end the crisis
in our health and care services, plan for
the future and guarantee real-terms pay
rises every year.

Agenda for Change terms and
conditions will be put into law
alongside safe staffing limits for all
staff. We will invest, train and develop
NHS staff throughout their careers.
We will introduce a training bursary
for nurses, midwives and allied

health professionals. We will

remove the obstacles to ethical
international recruitment.

A Labour government will review the tax
and pension changes implemented by
the Tory government to ensure that the
workforce is fairly rewarded and that
services are not adversely affected.

We will provide mental health

support for staff and create a working
environment within the NHS that is
safe, flexible and free from harassment,
bullying or violence.

Medicine

Under a Labour government the

NHS will be at the forefront of the
development of genomics and cell
therapies so that patients can benefit
from new treatments for cancer

and dementia, whilst ensuring the

UK continues to lead in medical
developments.

REBUILD OUR PUBLIC SERVICES

The Orkambi cystic fibrosis drug is just
the latest example of patients held

to ransom by corporations charging
extortionate prices for life-saving drugs.

We will establish a generic drug
company. If fair prices are rejected for
patented drugs we will use the Patents
Act provisions, compulsory licences and
research exemptions to secure access
to generic versions, and we will aim to
increase the number of pharmaceutical
jobs in the UK.

We will play an active role in the
medical innovation model, ensuring
rewards and incentives match the areas
of greatest health need.

We will ensure that all parts of the
NHS, the treatment of patients, the
employment of staff and medicine
pricing are all fully excluded and
protected from any international
trade deals.

We will progress clinically appropriate
prescription of medical cannabis.

We will abolish prescription charges
in England.

Social Care

Social care funding cuts have left 15
million older people without the care
they need.

Almost £8 billion has been lost from
social care budgets since 2010. This is
having a profound impact on unpaid
carers in this country, with 2.6 million

35

carers quitting their jobs to provide care
to family members. The current care
system is at risk of collapse.

A Labour government will build

a comprehensive National Care
Service for England. We will provide
community-based, person-centred
support, underpinned by the principles
of ethical care and independent living.
We will provide free personal care,
beginning with investments to ensure
that older people have their personal
care needs met, with the ambition

to extend this provision to all
working-age adults.

We will develop eligibility criteria that
ensures our service works for everyone,
including people with complex
conditions like dementia. We will
ensure no one ever again needs to face
catastrophic care costs of more than
£100,000 for the care they need in old
age, which we will underscore with a
lifetime cap on personal contributions
to care costs.

We will also invest in other social care
packages to reverse the damage done
by Conservative cuts and provide
additional care packages to support
both older people and working-age
adults living independently in their
own homes.

Our investments in social care services
will enable us to more than double the
number of people receiving publicly

36

funded care packages, improve the
standard of care provided to them and
remove the distinction between health
and care needs.

The provision of additional care
packages also means we can support
autistic people and people with
learning disabilities to move out from
inappropriate inpatient hospital settings
and provide support in their own homes

Our National Care Service will work in
partnership with the NHS, ensuring care
is delivered for people, not for profit.
Contracts for providing care will not
be awarded to organisations that do
not pay their fair share of taxes and do
not meet our high standards of quality
care. Our focus will be on the ethical
delivery of care that ensures growing
public sector provision and providers
who meet standards of transparency,
compliance and profit capping.

Nearly one and a half million people
work in the care sector, but there are
over 100,000 vacancies. Labour will
invest to end the social care crisis, end
15-minute care visits and provide care
workers with paid travel time, access to
training and an option to choose regular
hours. We will increase the Carer’s
Allowance for unpaid full-time carers.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

Education makes our
economy stronger,

our society richer

and our people more
fulfilled. Whether it is
businesses finding people
with the right skills, a
tech start-up making our
economy more dynamic
or more people in better
paid work and able to
contribute to public
services, we all benefit

from an educated society.

REBUILD OUR PUBLIC SERVICES

 

But education isn’t just vital to our economy - it lets

people develop their talents, overcomes injustices and
inequalities and helps us understand each other and
form social bonds.

The Conservatives have starved our education system
of funding, transferring costs onto students, staff and
communities. They have lost sight of its value.

From cutting budgets of schools, disproportionately
in deprived areas, to closing Sure Start centres

and underfunding support for those with special
educational needs and disabilities, Conservative
policy has meant those in most need have lost out.

That’s why our National Education Service will be at
the heart of Labour’s plan for real change. It will provide
free education for everyone throughout their lives and
will nurture every child and adult to find a path that’s
right for them, by promoting all types of learning,

skill and knowledge - technical, vocational, academic
and creative.

37

Early Years

Early years education is vital to
children’s development. Children from
disadvantaged backgrounds start
falling behind their peers before they
even start school. Early years education
also helps parents - usually mothers

~ by providing a bridge between
maternity/parental leave and school.

But the current system falls far short

of what is needed. One thousand Sure
Start centres have closed since 2010,
while the Tories’ so-called free childcare
offer is desperately underfunded

and excludes many of the most
disadvantaged children.

We will reverse cuts to Sure Start and
create a new service, Sure Start Plus,
with enough centres to provide a
genuinely universal service, available
in all communities, focused on the
under-2s.

Labour will radically reform early years
provision, with a two-term vision

to make high-quality early years
education available for every child. We
will also extend paid maternity leave to
12 months.

Within five years, all 2, 3 and 4-year-
olds will be entitled to 30 hours of free
preschool education per week and
access to additional hours at affordable,
subsidised rates staggered with
incomes. Labour will also work to extend
childcare provision for 1-year-olds

38

and to ensure that childcare provision
accommodates the working patterns
of all parents.

We will improve child development by
transitioning to a qualified, graduate-
led workforce. We value the experience
of current early years workers, and will
offer free training to the workforce to
attain these qualifications on the job.

Achieving this vision will require
significant investment. We will increase
funding and end the fragmentation

of the current system by funding
providers directly, making things
simpler and more sustainable for

both parents and providers.

We will recruit nearly 150,000 additional
early years staff, including Special
Educational Needs Co-ordinators, and
introduce a national pay scale, driving
up pay for the overwhelmingly

female workforce.

Maintained nursery schools provide a
proven, high-quality service but they
are under threat from Tory cuts. We will
provide sustainable, long-term funding
to secure their future.

Schools

Labour will make sure schools are
properly resourced with increased long-
term funding, while introducing a fairer
funding formula that leaves no child
worse off. We will invest to upgrade
schools that have fallen into disrepair.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

Labour's funding settlement will ensure
pupils are taught by a qualified teacher,
that every school is open for a full five
days a week, and maximum class sizes
of 30 for all primary school children. We
will also fund more non-contact time
for teachers to prepare and plan.

Schools have faced years of budget
cuts, leaving headteachers forced

to beg parents for money for basic
equipment. Despite promising to
reverse their own cuts, the Tories latest
funding announcement leaves 83% of
schools still facing cuts next year.

Schools are being subjected to
intensified testing, inspection, league
tables and competition. These aren't
improving pupil achievement or
narrowing the attainment gap, but
are contributing to a growing teacher
recruitment and retention crisis.

The narrowing curriculum is
denying many children access to
modern languages, arts and music,
or technical and engineering skills
that will be essential in a world
shaped by climate change.

The academies system is
over-centralised, inefficient and
undemocratic. Parents, communities
and even teachers are shut out of
decisions about schools and vulnerable
children are being let down. And there
is no evidence that academies deliver
better results.

The Conservatives have failed a
generation of children with special

REBUILD OUR PUBLIC SERVICES

educational needs and disabilities, who
have endured years of cuts and chaos.
Labour will provide the necessary
funding for children with special
educational needs and disabilities.

Labour will end the ‘high stakes’
testing culture of schools by
scrapping Key Stage 1 and 2 SATs

and baseline assessments, and
refocussing assessment on supporting
pupil progress.

We will introduce an Arts Pupil Premium
to fund arts education for every
primary school child. We will review the
curriculum to ensure that it enriches
students and covers subjects such as
black history and continues to teach
issues like the Holocaust. Pupils will
learn both the science of climate and
environmental emergency, and the
skills necessary to deal with them.

We will end the fragmentation and
marketisation of our school system by
bringing free schools and academies
back under control of the people who
know them best - parents, teachers
and local communities.

Under our system:

+ Budget and day-to-day decisions
will be transferred back to schools,
overseen by an accountable governing
body with elected representatives.

+ Responsibility for delivery of education and
support for young people will sit with local
authorities, they will manage admissions.
and have responsibility for school places,
including the power to open schools

39

+ Oversight and coordination, including
of continuous, peer-to-peer school
improvement modelled on the London
Challenge, will be carried out by
regional offices of the NES.

+ All schools will be subject to a
common rulebook, set out in
legislation.

We will replace Ofsted and transfer
responsibility for inspections to a
new body, designed to drive school
improvement.

A new teacher supply service will tackle
the waste of funds going to private
supply teacher agencies thanks to

the government's failure to recruit and
retain experienced teachers.

We will take action to end ‘off-rolling’,
removing the perverse incentives for
schools to let pupils fall out of the
system, by making schools accountable
for the outcomes of pupils who leave
their rolls.

We will properly regulate all education
providers and reform alternative
provision (AP) to ensure an excellent
education is the right of every child, and
improve the outcomes and life chances
of some of the most vulnerable children
in society.

We will ‘poverty-proof’ schools,
introducing free school meals for all
primary school children, encouraging
breakfast clubs, and tackling the cost of
school uniforms.

40

We will bring back the School Support
Staff Negotiating Body and national
pay settlements for teachers.

We will close the tax loopholes enjoyed
by elite private schools and use that
money to improve the lives of all
children, and we will ask the Social
Justice Commission to advise on
integrating private schools and creating
a comprehensive education system.

Further Education
and Lifelong Learning

With automation and the Green
Industrial Revolution bringing major
changes to industry, it is more
important than ever that people have
the opportunity to retrain and upskill
throughout their lives.

Under the Tories, adult education
has undergone 10 years of managed
decline. England already faces a
shortage of people with higher-level
technical qualifications, and demand
for these skills will only grow as we
create new green jobs.

Instead of investing in people to
prepare them for the jobs of the future,
the Conservatives have slashed funding
and cut opportunities.

Labour will ensure fairness and
sustainability in further education,
aligning the base rate of per-pupil
funding in post-16 education with
Key Stage 4, providing dedicated
capital funding to expand provision

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

and bringing back the Education
Maintenance Allowance as the Welsh
Labour Government has done.

Labour will make lifelong learning a
reality, giving everyone a free lifelong
entitlement to:

+ Training up to Level 3.

+ Six years training at Levels 4-6, with
maintenance grants for disadvantaged
learners.

We will introduce additional
entitlements for workers in industries
that are significantly affected by
industrial transition.

We will make sure training delivers the
right skills by giving employers a role
in co-design and co-production of
qualifications.

We will restore funding for English for
Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL)
courses and restore and expand the
Union Learning Fund, giving workers
the right to accrue paid time off for
education and training.

Labour will reform existing careers
advice, working towards an integrated
information, advice and guidance
system that covers the entire NES.

We will reverse the fragmentation

and privatisation of further and adult
education, incorporating it into a single
national system of regulation that
functions for education as our NHS
does for healthcare provision.

REBUILD OUR PUBLIC SERVICES

Higher Education

Under the Tories, universities are
treated as private businesses, left

at the mercy of market forces, while
top salaries soar and students pay
more for less. Tuition fees have
trebled and maintenance grants have
been scrapped, leaving the poorest
graduates with an average debt

of £57,000.

Labour will end the failed free-market
experiment in higher education,
abolish tuition fees and bring

back maintenance grants. We will
fundamentally rethink the assessment
of research and teaching quality, and
develop a new funding formula for
higher education that:

+ Ensures all public HE institutions
have adequate funding for teaching
and research.

+ Widens access to higher
education and reverses the
decline of part-time learning.

+ Ends the casualisation of staff.

We will transform the Office for
Students from a market regulator to a
body of the National Education Service,
acting in the public interest.

We will introduce post-qualification
admissions in higher education,

and work with universities to ensure
contextual admissions are used across
the system.

Recorded crime has risen, including violent crimes

like knife crime, which has risen to record high levels,
up 80% in the last five years. Last year more than 11
million crimes were recorded, and the proportion of
offences charged has fallen across all categories:
violence, drugs, robbery, burglary, weapons possession
and vehicle theft. Prosecutions have fallen to a record
low level. Some offences have been decriminalised in
practice. Only 1.4% of reported rapes are prosecuted.

Crime rates reflect the society we live in.
Conservative cuts to services have eroded the
fabric of local communities. The rate of school
exclusions has increased, as has social inequality
- crime rates are driven by both.

Where the Conservatives have failed, a Labour
government will take action to address the causes

of crime and end the epidemic. We will invest in our
communities and public services to build the stronger,

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

fairer society that keeps us all safer.
Rebuilding our criminal justice services,
we will focus on crime prevention and
early interventions, giving people the
best chance of rehabilitation.

We will rebuild our youth services and
guarantee young people's access to
youth workers. We will invest in a youth
justice system in which schools, local
authorities, health authorities and
youth services work together to divert
young people away from the pathways
towards crime.

Police

A Labour government will invest in
policing to prevent crime and make
our communities safer, and we will
enforce the laws protecting police
and other emergency workers from
violent assault.

We will rebuild the whole police
workforce, recruiting more police
officers, police community support
officers and police staff. We will
re-establish neighbourhood policing
and recruit 2,000 more frontline officers
than have been planned for by the
Conservatives. We will work with police
forces to invest in a modern workforce
to tackle the rise in violent crime and
cybercrime under the Tories. To deliver
these priorities, Labour will work with
police and crime commissioners to
reform police funding and share new
resources fairly, and to ensure that
local needs are met.

REBUILD OUR PUBLIC SERVICES

The Tory approach to policing has

been different: reckless, remote,
authoritarian, ineffective policing

on the cheap. It has led to what HM
Inspectorate of Constabulary described
as dangerous, disturbing practices,

with investigations shelved, vulnerable
victims let down and dangerous
suspects remaining at large.

We will retain local democratic
accountability for police forces and
reform the police funding formula to
ensure sufficient, sustainable resources
are fairly allocated. We will agree
resources with the police authorities

to combat crime and restore
community policing by consent.

Effective police work requires the police
to serve their communities and work
collaboratively with youth workers,
mental health services, schools, drug
rehabilitation programmes and other
public agencies. A police force working
within our communities, with the
capacity to gather local intelligence,

is also the frontline of our domestic
security - the first eyes and ears of
effective counter-terrorism.

We will work to eliminate institutional
biases against BAME communities.
Proportionate stop-and-search based
on intelligence is a needed tool of
effective policing, but the use of
expanded powers means black and
Asian men are still more likely to be
stopped and searched, poisoning
relations between the police and the
local communities they serve.

We will ensure better police training
on domestic abuse and offences
arising from coercive control, as well
as historical abuses and other crimes
neglected by the reduced forces
operating under Tory austerity.

A Labour government will establish a
Royal Commission to develop a public
health approach to substance misuse,
focusing on harm reduction rather than
criminalisation.

We will introduce minimum legal
standards of service for all victims
of crime.

Security

We will address the failure of the
Conservatives to take effective
measures against a growing problem
of extreme or violent radicalisation.
We will ensure closer counter terrorism
co-ordination between the police

and the security services, combining
neighbourhood expertise with
international intelligence.

We will ensure the powers exercised by
the security services are proportionate
and used in accordance with human
rights. We will review the circumstances
requiring judicial warrant. We will
ensure agencies are accountable and
strengthen the powers of the Joint
Intelligence and Security Committee.
We will constrain the right of the Prime
Minister to suppress publication of
committee reports.

A Labour government will review our
security strategies.

We will review the Prevent programme
to assess both effectiveness and
potential to alienate communities

and consider alternatives including
safeguarding programmes to protect
those vulnerable to the recruitment
propaganda and ideologies of the
far-right and others who promote terror
as a political strategy.

We will review the Protect programme
to ensure that public authorities take
appropriate security measures, without
alienating the communities they serve.

We will evaluate the mobile phone
trials with the aim of introducing an
emergency alert system.

We will use our diplomatic services,

our aid budgets and our international
standing to promote peaceful solutions
to conflicts and tackle the risks arising
from poverty, natural catastrophes and
population displacements. Our national
security is linked to global threats. We
will respect international law and avoid
needless military interventions.

Our security co-operation
arrangements with EU neighbours
are essential for our safety. If the
British people confirm their decision
to leave, we will prioritise agreement
of anew UK-EU Security Treaty.

Cybersecurity

Cybercrime and cyberwarfare are
growing, all around the world. Every
aspect of our lives, from the NHS to
our nuclear facilities, from transport
systems to communications networks
is vulnerable.

A Labour government, ever more
dependent on digital technology,
will overhaul our cybersecurity by
creating a co-ordinating minister and
regular reviews of cyber-readiness.

We will review the role and remit of
the National Cyber Security Centre to
determine whether it should be given
powers as an auditing body, with the
ability to issue warnings to private
and public sector organisations and
designate risk.

We will also review the structures and
roles of the National Crime Agency,
to strengthen the response to all
types of economic crime, including
cybercrime and fraud, and ensure a
modern, technologically advanced
police service that has the capacity
and skills to combat online crime,
supported by a new national strategy
on cybercrime and fraud.

REBUILD OUR PUBLIC SERVICES

Border Security

Our border security prevents serious
crimes including child abduction,
people trafficking, smuggling of drugs
and guns, terrorism and modern

day slavery. The Tories have further
weakened our borders, cutting another
200 jobs over the last four years.

They have failed to deliver exit checks.
In place of an effective border control
they have required landlords, teachers
and medical staff to work as unpaid
immigration officers, creating a hostile
environment.

A Labour government will review
our border controls to make them
more effective.

 

Smarter justice requires

cross-government action
to reduce the impact

of adverse childhood
experiences and to break
the vicious cycle of
poverty, inequality

and crime.

46

 

We will champion a joined-up approach, fostering
close working relationships between criminal justice
agencies with education authorities, health services
and others by establishing violence-reduction units
and ensuring vulnerable people get the support they
need by boosting public health, mental health and
early years services. Prison is not the best place to
address the drug addictions, mental illnesses and
debts that lead many people into crime.

The crisis in our criminal justice system has left
communities less safe, victims less supported and
people less able to defend their rights. Labour will
defend the rule of law.

Cutting thousands of prison officers has driven record
levels of prison violence. A Labour government will
restore total prison officer numbers to 2010 levels,
and phase out dangerous lone working. We will bring
PFI prisons back in-house and there will be no new

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

private prisons. We will tackle the prison
maintenance backlog and develop a
long-term estate strategy.

The Ministry of Justice’s own
evidence shows tens of thousands of
crimes could be prevented if robust
community sentences replace short
prison sentences. We will set new
standards for community sentences
and introduce a presumption against
prison sentences of six months

or less for non-violent and
non-sexual offences.

We will invest in proven alternatives to
custody, including women’s centres,
expand problem-solving courts and
plug the funding gap in the female
offender strategy. We will further
consider the evidence for effective
alternatives and rehabilitation of
prolific offenders.

A Labour government will reunify
probation and guarantee a publicly run,
locally accountable probation service.
Under Labour, probation staff and
professional standards will once again
be properly valued.

Legal aid cuts mean essential legal
help is too often denied. To help people
enforce their rights, we will restore all
early legal aid advice, including for
housing, social security, family and
immigration cases.

We will recruit hundreds of new
community lawyers, promote public
legal education and build an expanded
network of law centres.

REBUILD OUR PUBLIC SERVICES

We will ensure legal aid for inquests
into deaths in state custody and the
preparation of judicial review cases.
We will consult on the civil legal aid
means-test levels and act on the
criminal legal aid review.

We will defend workers’ ability to
recover legal representation costs
from negligent employers.

We will keep the right for workers to

be represented and recover their

costs in cases of employer negligence
leading to injury at work. We will review
the eligibility criteria for the criminal
injuries compensation scheme.

A Labour government will halt

court closures and cuts to staff, and
undertake a review of the courts reform
programme. We will facilitate a more
representative judiciary while upholding
its independence, and review funding
for the Crown Prosecution Service.

We will tackle the disproportionate
levels of BAME children in custody,
review the youth custody estate,
strengthen youth courts and build
on the Lammy Review.

Violence against women and girls is
unacceptable as is many women’s
experience of criminal justice agencies.
We will set new standards for tackling
domestic and sexual abuse and
violence, and appoint a Commissioner
for Violence against Women and Girls.
We will establish an independent review
into shamefully low rape prosecution
rates. We will establish a National

a7

Refuge Fund, ensure financial stability
for rape crisis centres and reintroduce
a Domestic Abuse Bill.

We will improve the safety of the

family court system for domestic
violence victims and prohibit their
cross-examination by their abuser.

We will introduce protections for victims
of so-called revenge porn. Labour will
introduce a no-fault divorce procedure.
We will uphold women’s reproductive
rights and decriminalise abortions.

We will establish public inquiries

into historical injustices including
blacklisting and Orgreave, and ensure
the second phase of the Grenfell
Inquiry has the confidence of all

those affected, especially the bereaved
families and survivors. We will also
consider a public inquiry in the case

of Zane Gbangbola.

We will require judicial warrants for
undercover operations and retain the
Mitting Inquiry into undercover policing.

We will release all papers on the
Shrewsbury 24 trials and 37 Cammell
Laird shipyard workers and introduce
a Public Accountability Bill. We will
ensure fair compensation for the
victims of contaminated blood
products across the UK.

Labour will reverse the
Tory decade of austerity
for local government and
aim to restore council
spending powers to 2010
levels over the lifetime of
the Parliament.

REBUILD OUR PUBLIC SERVICES

 

While those who make decisions in Whitehall can seem
distant and detached, our local councillors live among
us, shopping on the same high street, using the same
parks and leisure centres and sending their children to
the same schools. Thriving local councils are vital to
Labour's democratic transformation of

the economy.

Councils are the collective voice of local communities
and are on the frontline in delivering many essential
public services.

Tory cuts, which have been deliberately targeted
at the poorest areas of the country, have plunged
our councils into crisis and pushed many services
to breaking point. Decades of privatisation and
outsourcing have hollowed out council capacity,
taken money out of communities and undermined
democratic accountability.

49

We will act to bring services - from bin
collections to management of local
leisure centres - back in-house within
the next Parliament, improving service
quality, saving money and ensuring the
people who deliver vital local services
are treated decently.

Rural councils deliver public services
differently, and this needs to be
reflected in funding allocation
mechanisms. We will introduce a ‘rural-
proofing’ process so that all our laws,
policies and programmes consider their
impact on rural communities.

Where local areas experience a sharp
rise in demand for services, we will make
council funding more reactive, and will
work with councils to establish such a
fund to meet changing circumstances.

Our high streets are being decimated
by store closures and jobs losses.

High streets are more than places to
shop, they are places we go for culture,
company and character. We will revive
high streets by stopping bank branch
closures, banning ATM charges and
giving local government new powers
to put empty shops to good use.

Business rates are causing real issues
for high-street retailers and others.

A Labour government will review

the option of a land value tax on
commercial landlords as an
alternative and develop a retail
sector industrial strategy.

We will make sure the rights of
consumers are enhanced and

50

protected, that safety standards are
maintained and improved, and that
local authority trading standards
departments and other consumer
protection agencies have the resources
to enforce those rights and standards

We will stop Crown Post Office closures
and bring Royal Mail back into public
ownership at the earliest opportunity,
reuniting it with the Post Office and
creating a publicly owned Post Bank
run through the post office network

to ensure every community has easy
access to face-to-face, trusted and
affordable banking.

A Business Development Agency will be
based in the Post Bank, providing free
support and advice on how to launch,
manage and grow a business.

Pubs are community hubs but 18 are
closing each week in Britain. Labour will
list pubs as Assets of Community Value
so community groups have the first
chance to buy local pubs when they
are under threat.

We will ensure libraries are preserved
for future generations and updated
with Wi-Fi and computers. We will
reintroduce library standards so that
government can assess and guide
councils in delivering the best
possible service.

As well as the presumption to insource
public services, we will build community
wealth by giving communities the
powers and resources they need to
keep public spending circulating in

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

the local economy, rather than being
sucked offshore to corporate tax
havens. We will extend community
control in the private sector by
supporting local and community
businesses. We will give a new
Co-operative Development Agency
a mission to double the size of the
co-operative sector.

Labour will put the voices of local
people at the heart of planning. We will
rebalance power in the planning system
by giving local government greater
freedom to set planning fees and by
requiring the climate and environmental
emergency to be factored into all
planning decisions.

Young people have been let down by
the Conservatives. At least 750 youth
centres have closed since 2012. Too
many young people now have nowhere
to go, nothing to do and no one to help
them with their problems. Labour will
build a properly funded, professionally
staffed National Youth Service, and

will guarantee every young person has
access to local, high-quality youth work.

Vulnerable children have suffered most,
with many left waiting until crisis point
for support. Councils are having to meet
the needs of more at-risk children with
lower funding.

Labour will launch a wholesale
review of the care system, including
kinship care, considering national
standards such as a central register

REBUILD OUR PUBLIC SERVICES

of foster parents and regulation of
semi-supported housing, to ensure
we meet the needs of every child.

We will rebuild early intervention
services and replace the Troubled
Families programme with a Stronger
Families programme, refocused on
long-term support to reduce the risk
of children going into care.

We will protect and build on
Staying Put for over-18s in care
and the Adoption Support Fund.

The Conservatives have
cut 11,500 firefighter jobs
and closed dozens of fire
stations. Response times
have got slower and lives
have been put at risk.

FIRE AND RESCUE

 

A Labour government will halt the cuts and further
invest in our Fire and Rescue Service, recruiting at
least 5,000 new firefighters. We will learn lessons from
the public inquiries into Grenfell and earlier disasters.
We will establish a broadly based implementation
taskforce, but will not wait for final recommendations
to make urgently needed changes. We will ensure
dedicated fire controls under Fire and Rescue Service
governance and provide resources for a public Fire
and Rescue College to ensure that necessary training,
research and planning is undertaken.

We will conduct a review of the Fire and Rescue
Service, evaluating safe staffing levels and consulting
on national minimum standards. We will establish in
law a standards body for fire prevention, protection
and intervention, with trade union representation

at all levels. We will reinstate separate governance
arrangements for Fire and Rescue Service and police
services. We will give fire services the duty to co-
ordinate the emergency response to floods locally.

Digital

Digital and technological
advancements bring challenges,

but also huge opportunities. In the

age of Al and automation, digital
connectivity will underpin our future
economy. We will need world-class
digital infrastructure in which everyone
can share.

Labour will deliver free full-fibre
broadband to all by 2030.

We will establish British Broadband,
with two arms: British Digital
Infrastructure (BDI) and the British
Broadband Service (BBS). We will bring
the broadband-relevant parts of BT
into public ownership, with a jobs
guarantee for all workers in existing

REBUILD OUR PUBLIC SERVICES

 

broadband infrastructure and
retail broadband work.

BDI will roll out the remaining 90-92%
of the full-fibre network, and acquire
necessary access rights to existing
assets. BBS will coordinate the delivery
of free broadband in tranches as

the full-fibre network is rolled out,
beginning with the communities worst
served by existing broadband networks.
Taxation of multinationals, including
tech giants, will pay for the operating
costs of the public full-fibre network.
The plan will boost jobs, tackle regional
inequality and improve quality of

life as part of a mission to connect

the country.

We will enforce a legal duty of care to
protect our children online, impose fines

on companies that fail on online abuse
and empower the public with a Charter
of Digital Rights.

Culture

Britain’s thriving arts, culture and
creative industries drive investments
and encourage tourism.

A Labour government will open up
career opportunities in these industries
for everyone and consult on ways to
address the gender imbalance in the
digital creative industries.

We will introduce an Arts Pupil Premium
to every primary school in England -

a £160 million annual boost for schools
to ensure creative and arts education

is embedded in secondary education,
and providing a pathway to grow our
thriving creative sector.

We will invest in the towns and
communities neglected for too long,
with a £1 billion Cultural Capital Fund
to transform libraries, museums and
galleries across the country.

We will make the distribution of
National Lottery funding more
transparent to help communities

get their fair share of project funding.

We will maintain free entry to
museums, because everyone should
have access to our shared heritage.
Building on the success of the UK City
of Culture, we will launch a Town of
Culture competition.

54

We will work with trade unions and
employers to make creative jobs
accessible for all, ensuring diversity
in these industries so that everyone
sees themselves represented on
screen and on stage. We will review
the copyright framework to ensure
fair remuneration for artists and
content creators.

Media

A Labour government will ensure a
healthy future for all our public service
broadcasters, including BBC Alba and
S4C. We will protect free TV licences for
over-75s.

A free and fair press is vital to protecting
democracy and holding the powerful to
account.

We will address misconduct and

the unresolved failures of corporate
governance raised by the second stage
of the abandoned Leveson Inquiry. We
will take steps to ensure that Ofcom

is better able to safeguard a healthy
plurality of media ownership and to
put in place clearer rules on who is fit
and proper to own or run TV and radio
stations. We will take action to address
the monopolistic hold the tech giants
have on advertising revenues and will
support vital local newspapers and
media outlets.

We will consult media-sector workers
and trade unions to establish an inquiry
into the ‘fake news’ undermining trust in

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

media, democracy and public debate,
and on a legal right of public interest
defence for journalists.

Sport

Sport enriches our lives, binds
communities together and helps
us all to stay healthy.

Sport must be accessible and run in the
interests of those who participate in it
and love it.

In football, the professional game

has become divided between the
extremes of the very rich and the very
poor with clubs in Bury and Bolton
facing collapse. A Labour government
will examine the state of the game,

its governance and regulation, its
ownership rules and the support and
funding of the clubs that are vital to
local communities. We will review the
‘fit and proper person test’ for club
owners and directors and ensure that
supporters’ trusts have a proper role so
that the professional game is properly
run for all its fans and all its clubs.

A Labour government will legislate for
accredited football supporters’ trusts to
be able to appoint and remove at least
two club directors and purchase shares
when clubs change hands. We will
regulate safe standing in stadiums and
ensure that a proportion of the Premier
League’s television rights income is
spent on grassroots football facilities.

REBUILD OUR PUBLIC SERVICES

We will add the ICC Cricket World
Cup to the list of crown jewel sporting
events that are broadcast free-to-air.

We will commission an independent
review into discrimination in sport.

Gambling

A Labour government will curb
gambling advertising in sports and
introduce a new Gambling Act fit for
the digital age, establishing gambling
limits, a levy for problem gambling
funding and mechanisms for consumer
compensations.

Civic Society

In the years of austerity it was
non-government organisations that
often held the social fabric of our
society together, protecting our
communities from even greater

harm and providing precisely targeted
support. As we rebuild our public
services, we will support and maintain
the social capital values of these
organisations.

Work should provide

to allow for a fulfilling life
outside it.

‘TACKLE POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

 

Under the Tories, pay has stagnated while insecurity

and inequality are rising.

Work no longer guarantees a way out of poverty.
Of 14.3 million people in poverty, nine million live in
families where at least one adult works. Real wages
are still lower than before the financial crisis, while
dividends paid to shareholders are up 85%.

Labour will eradicate in-work poverty in our first term
by tackling the structural causes of poverty and
inequality, such as low pay and high living costs,

while raising the floor provided by our social safety net.

Too many people have found themselves in a spiral of
debt as wages fell and housing costs rose. Labour will
cap the total amount that can be paid in overdraft fees
or interest on a loan.

We will rapidly introduce a Real Living Wage of at least
£10 per hour for all workers aged 16 and over, and use

savings to public finances to help small
businesses manage the extra cost.

We will give workers a stake in the
companies they work for - and a share
of the profits they help create - by
requiring large companies to set up
Inclusive Ownership Funds (IOFs). Up
to 10% of a company will be owned
collectively by employees, with
dividend payments distributed equally
among all, capped at £500 a year,

and the rest being used to top up the
Climate Apprenticeship Fund. The cap
will rise to ensure that no more than
25% of dividends raised by IOFs are
redistributed in this way.

And we will explore other innovative
ways of responding to low pay,
including a pilot of Universal

Basic Income.

Growing numbers of the workforce are
self-employed. While for some this
brings freedom and autonomy, it can
also bring insecurity. Self-employed
people will benefit from a broad range
of our policies, from free childcare and
full-fibre broadband to face-to-face
lending and business support through
our Post Bank.

We will also seek to develop tailored
support and protections for the self-
employed, including: collective income
protection insurance schemes, annual
income assessments for those on
Universal Credit, and better access to
mortgages and pension schemes.

We will tackle late payments that
leave small businesses and the
self-employed waiting months to

be paid, including banning late payers
from public procurement.

Ministry for Employment Rights

Throughout history, working people
in Britain have improved their lives by
coming together to demand rights
and protections. Even after decades
in which workers’ rights have been
cut back and their unions’ capacity
to defend them have been slashed,

 

the Tories believe that workers’ terms
and conditions should be dictated by
employers on a ‘take it or leave it’ basis.

We are proud of the trade union
movement's historic achievements in
giving people a voice at work through
collective action. It is not just part of our
history; it is also part of our future. Only
by shifting the balance of power back
towards workers will we achieve decent
wages, security and dignity at work.

The next Labour government will
transform people’s lives for the better
through the biggest extension of
workers’ rights in history.

We will give working people a voice
at the Cabinet table by establishing
a Ministry for Employment Rights.

We will start to roll out sectoral
collective bargaining across the
economy, bringing workers and
employers together to agree legal

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

minimum standards on a wide range of
issues, such as pay and working hours,
that every employer in the sector must
follow. Sectoral collective bargaining will
increase wages and reduce inequality.
This will also stop good employers
being undercut by bad employers.

We will tackle insecurity by:

+ Giving everyone full rights from day
one on the job.

+ Strengthening protections for
whistleblowers and rights against
unfair dismissal for all workers, with
extra protections for pregnant women,
those going through the menopause
and terminally ill workers.

+ Ending bogus self-employment
and creating a single status of
‘worker’ for everyone apart from
those genuinely self-employed in
business on their own account, so that
employers can not evade workers’
rights; and banning overseas-only
recruitment practices.

+ Introducing a legal right to collective
consultation on the implementation of
new technology in workplaces.

+ Banning zero-hour contracts and
strengthening the law so that those
who work regular hours for more than
12 weeks will have a right to a regular
contract, reflecting those hours.

We will help people balance work and
family life by:

TACKLE POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

+ Increasing wages through sectoral
collective bargaining.

+ Requiring breaks during shifts to
be paid.

+ Requiring cancelled shifts to be paid
and proper notice for changes
in hours.

+ Giving all workers the right to flexible
working.

+ Extending statutory maternity pay
rom nine to 12 months.

+ Doubling paternity leave from two
weeks to four and increasing statutory
paternity pay.

+ Introducing statutory bereavement
leave, guaranteeing workers time
off to grieve the loss of close family
members or following miscarriage.

+ Introducing four new bank holidays
celebrating our four patron saints’
days.

+ Reviewing family-friendly employment
rights, including rights to respond to
‘amily emergencies.

We will make sure people are treated
equally at work by:

 

+ Requiring employers to devise and
implement plans to eradicate the
gender pay gap - and pay inequalities
underpinned by race and/or disability
- or face fines.

+ Requiring employers to maintain
workplaces free of harassment,
including harassment by third parties.

+ Increasing protection against
redundancy for people wherever
they work.

+ Giving statutory rights to equalities
representatives.

+ Setting up a Royal Commission to
bring health (including mental health)
and safety legislation up to date.

+ Ensuring that public-facing workers
are protected by toughening the law
against abuse and violence.

+ Banning unpaid internships.

We will remove unfair and unnecessary
restrictions on trade unions, allowing
people to come together and speak up
on issues that affect them at work.

We will:

+ Allow trade unions to use secure
electronic and workplace ballots.

+ Remove unnecessary restrictions on
industrial action.

+ Strengthen and enforce trade unions’
right of entry to workplaces to
organise, meet and represent their
members and to recruit.

+ Ban union-busting, strengthen
protection of trade union
representatives against unfair
dismissal and union members from
intimidation, harassment, threats and
blacklisting.

+ Repeal anti-trade union legislation
including the Trade Union Act 2016
and create new rights and freedoms

62

for trade unions to help them win a
better deal for working people.

+ Simplify the law around union
recognition.

+ Give union reps adequate time off
for union duties.

We will develop collective income-
protection insurance schemes for the
self-employed. We will introduce a
maximum workplace temperature to
protect workers and require employers
to take counteracting measures.

For years, the UK has been in breach

of our international obligations. We

will bring UK law into line with the
International Labour Organisation
standards it has ratified, so Britain leads
the world, instead of engaging in a race
to the bottom.

Working Time

Time off to rest, relax and be with family
is essential to a happy and fulfilling life,

but workers in the UK put in some of the
longest hours in Europe.

Labour will tackle excessive working
hours. Within a decade we will reduce
average full-time weekly working hours
to 32 across the economy, with no

loss of pay, funded by productivity

increases.
We will meet this target by:

+ Ending the opt-out provision for
the EU Working Time Directive and
enforcing working-time regulations.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

+ Setting up an independent Working
Time Commission to advise on
raising minimum holiday entitlements
and reducing maximum weekly
working time.

+ Mandating bargaining councils to
negotiate reductions in working time.

+ Investing to increase productivity
and making sure workers share the
benefits.

We will keep restrictions on Sunday
trading in place and review unpaid
overtime.

Enforcement

Rights don’t mean anything unless
they're enforced, but that is not
happening under the Tories.

That doesn’t just hurt workers who lose
out, it is also bad for employers who
follow the law and are undercut by
unscrupulous competitors prepared

to break it.

Strong trade unions are the best and
most effective way to enforce rights at
work. Labour will also introduce a new,
unified Workers’ Protection Agency

to enforce workplace rights, including
the Real Living Wage. It will be given
extensive powers to inspect workplaces
and bring prosecutions and civil
proceedings on workers’ behalf.

We will keep employment tribunals
free, extend their powers, and
introducenew Labour Courts with a
stronger role for people with industrial
experience on panels.

TACKLE POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Rewriting the Rules

Social justice also means levelling the
playing field between small and big
business, and ensuring that democracy
and accountability are valued across
society, including in the private sector.

Businesses are the heartbeat of our
economy, creating jobs, wealth and
innovations.

But the upper echelons of corporate
Britain have been corrupted by a
culture in which the long-term health
of a company is sacrificed for a quick
buck for a few: a short-term culture
has seen some treasured companies
asset-stripped, leaving workers, small
business suppliers and pensioners in
the lurch. Too often, the link between
reward and long-term performance is
broken for short-term greed.

Labour will take on short-termism and
corporate greed, making sure good
businesses are rewarded, not undercut.
We will rewrite the rules of the economy
and ensure everyone plays by them.

We will amend the Companies Act,
requiring companies to prioritise
long-term growth while strengthening
protections for stakeholders, including
smaller suppliers and pension funds.
We will tackle late payments that leave
small businesses waiting months to be
paid, including banning late payers from
public procurement.

For small businesses, we will ensure no
quarterly reporting for businesses below
the VAT threshold.

We will require one-third of boards to
be reserved for elected worker-directors
and give them more control over
executive pay - because when those
who depend on a company have a say
in running it, that company generally
does better and lasts longer.

We will introduce a broader ‘public
interest test’ to prevent hostile
takeovers and asset-stripping
weakening our industrial base and
destroying treasured home-grown
companies. And we will give workers
a voice on public bodies such as the
Competition and Markets Authority.

We will let struggling companies go into
protective administration, so they can
be sold as a going concern rather than
collapsing into insolvency.

Audits are vital to corporate
accountability, but the auditing industry
is dominated by a few players riddled
with conflicts of interest. Labour will
separate audit and accounting activities
in major firms and impose more robust
rules on auditors.

We will tackle regulatory capture and
streamline regulation by creating a new
Business Commission, responsive to
parliamentary select committees.

Social Justice Commission

Labour will usher in a new era of social
justice in Britain. Everyone in our society
should be allowed to flourish regardless

64

of what class or postcode they are born
into, or the colour of their skin.

But that’s impossible when you cannot
meet your most basic needs and have
to choose between eating and heating
your home. Britain is one of the richest
countries in the world, but under the
Tories millions of people can’t make
ends meet.

They tell us we shouldn't care about
inequality, because social mobility
allows those who work hard to get
on. But nobody becomes a billionaire
through hard work alone, and as
inequality has grown, it has become
more entrenched.

For Labour, the true measure of fairness
is not social mobility but social justice.

Implicit in the notion of social mobility
is the idea that poverty and inequality
are acceptable provided some people
can climb the social ladder.

Social justice, on the other hand,
demands that we end poverty, reduce
inequality and create a society in which
the conditions for a fulfilling life are
available to everyone.

Labour will replace the Social Mobility
Commission with a Social Justice
Commission, based in the Treasury,
with wide-ranging powers to hold us,
and future governments, to account.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

Labour is the party of
equality, committed to
achieving a world free
from all forms of bigotry
and discrimination.
Whether campaigning
on the streets or

passing legislation in
government, Labour

is the only party to
consistently stand with
women, disabled people,
people from ethnic
minority backgrounds
and LGBT+ communities.

‘TACKLE POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

 

The Conservatives have failed to tackle society's

burning injustices. Instead, they have inflicted injustice
after injustice on women, Black, Asian and Minority
Ethnic (BAME) and LGBT+ communities and disabled
people. Over 85% of the burden of Tory/Lib Dem cuts
has fallen on the shoulders of women.

Labour will create a new Department for Women

and Equalities, with a full-time Secretary of State,
responsible for ensuring all our policies and laws are
equality-impact assessed in order to deliver a fairer
society for women and all under-represented groups.
We will establish a modernised National Women’s
Commission as an independent advisory body to
contribute to a Labour government.

We are guided by our firm commitment to the Human
Rights Act and Convention on Human Rights that have
been consistently attacked by the Conservatives. We
will ratify both the Istanbul Convention on preventing
domestic abuse and the ILO Convention on Violence
and Harassment at work.

65

We will put class at the heart of Britain’s
equality agenda and create a new
ground for discrimination on the basis
of socio-economic disadvantage.

Women

Labour will put women at the heart of
our government and programme. Next
year marks the 50th anniversary of the
Equal Pay Act, yet women still earn 13%
less than men. Labour will take action to
close the gender pay gap by 2030.

We will also:

+ Deliver gender pay equality by making
the state responsible for enforcing
equal pay legislation for the first time.
The new Workers’ Protection Agency
working with HMRC will ensure that
employers take equal pay seriously
and take positive action to close the
gender pay gap. Women will no longer
be left to take enforcement action by
themselves through the courts.

Require all employers with over 250
employees to obtain government
certification on gender equality or face
further auditing and fines. By the end
of 2020, we will lower the threshold to
workplaces with 50 employees, whilst
providing the necessary additional
support for small businesses.

Revolutionise parents’ rights by
increasing paid maternity leave from
nine to 12 months, doubling paternity
leave to four weeks and extending
pregnancy protection. We will ban the

dismissal of pregnant women without
prior approval of the inspectorate.

+ Transform the workplace and require

all large employers to have flexible
working, including a menopause
policy, and consider changes to
sickness and absence practices.

+ Enable positive action for recruitment

to roles where employers can justify
the need for more diversity and
introduce a right for all workers to
request flexibility over their hours from
the first day of employment.

+ Ensure that the single-sex-based

exemptions contained in the Equality
Act 2010 are understood and fully
enforced in service provision.

+ Create a safer society for women

and prioritise domestic abuse as a
health issue, introduce 10 days of paid
leave for survivors of domestic abuse,
and ensure women’s refuges receive
the long-term sustainable funding
they need. Misogyny and violence
against women and girls will become
hate crimes.

+ Increase women’s representation

across parliament by building on

the Equality Act, passed by the

last Labour government, and enact
Section 106 so that all political parties
publish diversity data about electoral
candidates.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

Race Equality

Achieving racial equality is a bedrock
Labour value. It has never been more
important than in the current climate.
We are proud of the way our country
has been shaped by the contributions,
cultures and values of people from
around the world.

The Conservatives have fanned the
flames of racism, using difference

to divide. They have made BAME
people pay the price for their austerity
project and scapegoated refugees and
migrants. Never was this starker than
with their ‘hostile environment’, leading
to the scandalous treatment of the
Windrush generation. Hate crime has

more than doubled in the last five years.

This is a wake-up call for all of us.

Labour will ensure a pathway to
economic inclusion for all, putting
an end to all forms of racism and
discrimination in our economy and
society. Inclusion will be at the heart
of its programme for government.

We will:

+ Seek to end the politics of hate and
commission an independent review
into the threat of far-right extremism
and how to tackle it.

+ Put wealth and power in the hands of
the many, extend pay-gap reporting
to BAME groups and tackle pay
discrimination on the basis of race.

+ Commit our National Investment
Bank to addressing discrimination in

TACKLE POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

access to finance, which many BAME
business owners face; and take action
to ensure that BAME and women
business owners have access to
government contracts and spending.

+ Implement recommendations of
the Lammy Review to address the
disparity of treatment and outcomes
for BAME people within the criminal
justice system.

+ Create an Emancipation Educational
Trust to educate around migration and
colonialism, and to address the legacy
of slavery and teach how it interrupted
a rich and powerful black history which
is also British history.

On religious discrimination, we will:

+ Strengthen protection for religious
communities and amend the law
to include attacks on places of
worship (including synagogues,
temples, mosques and churches)
as a specific aggravated offence.

+ Review current levels of funding for
and access to the Places of Worship
Protective Security Funding Scheme,
maintain funding in real terms for the
Community Security Trust, and consult
on giving it statutory protection to
ensure that religious communities
have the support they need.

Disability with Dignity

Over the last 10 years, through
a catalogue of punitive welfare
policies, the dignity of people with

67

disabilities has been degraded by the
Conservatives. Not one, but two UN
reports describe the government having
committed ‘systematic violations’ of the
rights of disabled people - while their
families have been ‘driven to breaking
point’ by cuts to social care.

More disabled people are now living in
poverty, and people have died because
of this government's choice to make
the most vulnerable pay for tax cuts
for the few. Labour will end this cruelty,
restoring the protections that disabled
people and their families - many of
whom shoulder the cost of their care

- should expect in one of the richest
countries in the world.

Labour supports the principle of
‘nothing about us without us’.

We will:

+ Champion the social model of
disability throughout government.
Through our new Department for
Women and Equalities, we will
ensure that disabled people can be
independent and equal in society, with
choice and control over their own lives.

+ Transform the workplace for disabled
people by requiring that all employers
be trained to better support them,
while introducing mandatory disability
pay-gap reporting for companies with
over 250 employees.

+ End disability discrimination and
update the Equality Act to introduce
new specific duties including disability

68

leave, paid and recorded separately
from sick leave.

+ Recommend that the Equality
and Human Rights Commission
prepare a specific code of practice
on reasonable adjustments to
supplement existing codes. This
will provide an appropriate balance
between flexibility and clarity on
how ‘reasonable’ cost is determined.
The code will also set timescales
for implementation of reasonable
adjustments to end the long and
distressing delays experienced by
disabled workers.

+ Reinstate the Access to Elected Office
Fund to enable disabled people to run
for elected office.

+ Adopt a British Sign Language Act,
giving BSL full legal recognition in law.

We will work with employers, trade
unions and public services to improve
awareness of neurodiversity in the
workplace and in society.

LGBT+ Equality

Labour has a proud history of standing
shoulder to shoulder with LGBT+
people. We abolished Section 28,
equalised the age of consent, created
civil partnerships, and only with

Labour votes could equal marriage
become law. Labour is committed to
reforming the Gender Recognition Act
2004 to introduce self-declaration for
transgender people, but we are not

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

complacent about the culture shift
required to make LGBT+ inclusivity a
reality. The Conservatives have been
slow to understand the scale of abuse
and discrimination LGBT+ people
continue to face in our society.

Labour will eliminate remaining areas
of discrimination in law, ensuring
that LGBT+ people can live in safety
and dignity.

We will:

+ Put LGBT+ equality at the heart of
government, ensuring our public
services are LGBT+ inclusive and
delivering on the national LGBT
Action Plan.

+ Take steps to safeguard LGBT+ rights
inside or outside the EU, such as
retaining and promoting the Human
Rights Act.

* Tackle the homelessness and rough
sleeping crisis in the UK, ensuring
that all strategies and services
are tailored to understand needs
unique to LGBT+ homeless people,
particularly young people who make
up a disproportionate number of our
currently homeless people.

+ Provide sufficient funding for schools
to deliver mandatory LGBT+ inclusive
relationships and sex education.

+ Fully fund sexual health services and
roll out PrEP medication.

TACKLE POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

+ Respond fast and firmly wherever
LGBT+ people face violence
or persecution internationally
and appoint a dedicated global
ambassador to the Foreign Office on
LGBT+ issues.

Labour will work with organisations and
charities already making the UK a more
equal and fairer society and together
we will build a country for the many,
not the few.

A Labour government

will establish a humane
immigration system

and end the ‘hostile
environment’ that caused
the Windrush scandal

of British citizens being
deported. Instead, our
system will be built on
human rights and aimed
at meeting the skills and
labour shortages that
exist in our economy and
public services.

70

 

Our immigration system must allow us to recruit the
people we need, and to welcome them and their
families. Our work visa system must fill any skills or
labour shortages that arise. The movement of people
around the world has enriched our society,

our economy and our culture.

We will take decisive action to regulate the labour
market to stop the undercutting of wages and
conditions, and the exploitation of all workers including
migrant workers. It is the actions of bad bosses and
successive Conservative governments that have driven
down wages and working terms and conditions. Labour
will ensure all workers have full and equal rights from
day one, with a Real Living Wage for all.

The Conservative policy of pursuing net migration
targets has undermined our economy and our public
services, refusing entry to essential key workers
including nurses. It has created a hostile environment

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

within our communities, encouraged
the demonisation of migrants and
enabled the callous use of three million
residents as bargaining chips in our
negotiations over EU withdrawal.

Moreover, the Tories have not once
met their own targets. Their migration
policies are a complete and damaging
failure, whichever way they are

looked at.

We will scrap the 2014 Immigration
Act introduced by the Tories with their
Liberal Democrat coalition partners.
We are for a levelling up of rights, not a
race to the bottom. We will not tolerate
a two-tier system for those entitled to
be here.

The Windrush scandal continues
to create new victims. We will
end its injustices and provide fair
compensation to those who have
unfairly suffered.

We will end indefinite detention, review
the alternatives to the inhumane
conditions of detention centres, and
close Yarl’s Wood and Brook House,
from which immediate savings would
contribute towards a fund of £20 million
to support the survivors of modern
slavery, people trafficking and domestic
violence. We will ensure justice for
migrant domestic workers and restore
the overseas domestic workers’ visa.

If we remain in the EU, freedom of
movement would continue. If we leave,
it will be subject to negotiations, but
we recognise the social and economic

TACKLE POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

benefits that free movement has
brought both in terms of EU citizens
here and UK citizens abroad - and we
will seek to protect those rights.

In accordance with our values and
domestic laws, we will uphold the
right to a family life for British, EU and
non-EU residents alike. We will end
the deportation of family members of
people entitled to be here and end the
minimum income requirements which
separate families.

Refugees

Refugees are victims of wars,
environmental catastrophes,
famine or persecution.

This government has failed its
international legal obligations to
refugees and to allow people to
exercise their rights to seek asylum.

A Labour government will uphold those
rights and meet those obligations.

We will work with others to resume
rescue missions in the Mediterranean,
co-operate with the French authorities
to put an end to the horrific camps,
and establish safe and legal routes for
asylum seekers.

Once here, refugees will have the right
to work, access to public services

and will be treated humanely by
government at all levels.

Labour holds social

security in the same
esteem as our health and
education systems.

It is there to help each

of us in times of need.

If someone falls on hard
times - because they
lose their job, get sick or
lose a loved one - Labour
will help them live with
dignity and provide
support to get them
back on their feet.

2

 

While Labour wants a society in which people care for
one another, the Tories are trying to pitch us against
each other.

Under the Tories, the social security system has lost
sight of its purpose. Poverty has become endemic,
the glue that binds our society together has come
unstuck and, in the words of the United Nations, the
UK’s social safety net ‘has been deliberately removed
and replaced with a harsh and uncaring ethos’.

The cruelty and heartlessness of the Tories has made
the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) a
symbol of fear. When people feel the DWP is more
about harassment than a helping hand, something has
gone seriously wrong. Labour will completely change
this culture, replacing the DWP on day one with a
Department for Social Security, which will be there to
help and support people, not punish and police them.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

 

We will put children at the heart of
everything we do, developing a cross-
governmental National Strategy for
Childhood focusing on health, security,
well-being and poverty. We will give
effect to the UN Convention on the
Rights of the Child.

Universal Credit

The Tories’ flagship social security
programme, Universal Credit (UC),

has been a catastrophe. It has pushed
thousands of people into poverty,
caused families to lose their homes and
forced parents to visit food banks in
order to feed their children.

Labour will scrap UC. We will
immediately stop moving people onto
it and design an alternative system that
treats people with dignity and respect.
Our ambition in designing this system
will be to end poverty by guaranteeing
a minimum standard of living.

We will start developing this system
immediately. But we have learned the
lessons from Tory failure: major policy
change can't be delivered overnight,
especially when people’s lives depend
on it. So we will also implement an
emergency package of reforms to
mitigate some of the worst features
of UC while we develop our
replacement system.

TACKLE POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

We will end the five-week wait by
introducing an interim payment
based on half an estimated monthly
entitlement. We will immediately
suspend the Tories’ vicious sanction
regime and ensure that employment
support is positive not punitive.

We will stop 300,000 children from
being in poverty by scrapping the
benefit cap and the two child limit, so
ending the immoral and outrageous
‘rape clause’ We will pay childcare costs
up front so that parents aren't forced to
turn down work or get into debt to pay
for childcare.

Labour will protect women in abusive
relationships by splitting payments
and paying the child element to the
primary carer. We will make it easier for
people to manage their living costs by
introducing fortnightly payments and
paying the housing element directly to
landlords.

The Conservative’s ‘digital only’
approach is excluding vulnerable
people. Labour will end the digital
barrier and offer telephone, face-to-
face and outreach support. We will
recruit 5,000 additional advisors to
deliver this.

Tory cuts are pushing people into rent
arrears and leaving them at risk of
homelessness. We will stop housing
costs running away from benefits

by scrapping the bedroom tax and
increasing the Local Housing Allowance.

3

Disabled People

Labour stands with and for disabled
people. We will always challenge stigma
and discrimination wherever it is found
and support the right of disabled
people to live independently and be
treated with respect.

The Tories’ rhetoric of ‘scroungers’

and ‘skivers’ has whipped up hatred of
disabled people, with disability hate
crime skyrocketing, up 37% in the last
year alone. Labour will never demonise
disabled people or the unemployed.

Labour follows the social model of
disability — it is not people’s condition
or impairment that disables them,
but society's failure to adapt to those
conditions and impairments. We are
committed to removing the barriers
constructed by society and ensuring
that disabled people can participate
fully and equally in our society.

The Conservatives have created a
hostile environment for disabled people,
who have borne the brunt of Tory cuts.
The United Nations has said that the
Tories have systematically and gravely
violated disabled people's rights by
denying them the support they are
entitled to.

Labour will end this hostile environment.

We will give effect to the UN
Convention on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities and amend the
Equality Act to reflect the social
model of disability.

m

We will stop the dehumanising Work
Capability and PIP Assessments,

which repeatedly and falsely find ill or
disabled people fit to work, and make
sure all assessments are done in-house.

Social security is meant to help
disabled people cope with the
additional costs and disadvantages
they face. But the Tories have cut back
that support to inadequate levels. Time
and again disabled people have had to
fight through the courts to receive the
support they are entitled to.

Labour will make sure people who are ill
and disabled receive the support they
need to lead full, independent lives.

We will:

+ Increase Employment and Support
Allowance by £30 per week for those
in the work-related activity group.

+ Raise the basic rate of support for
children with disabilities to the level of
Child Tax Credits.

+ Ensure that severely disabled people
without a formal carer receive extra
support to enable them to meet the
extra costs they inevitably face.

We will support those who look after
others, increasing the Carer’s Allowance
to the level of the Jobseeker’s
Allowance.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

We will help disabled people who want
to work by bringing back specialist
employment advisors, introducing

a government-backed Reasonable
Adjustments Passport scheme to help
people move between jobs more easily,
and reviewing support for disabled
people at work, including the Access to
Work scheme.

Pensions

People work hard for most of their lives
and deserve a decent retirement free of
financial stress and insecurity.

Under the Tories, 400,000 pensioners
have been pushed into poverty and

a generation of women born in the
1950s have had their pension age
changed without fair notification.

This betrayal left millions of women
with no time to make alternative plans
- with sometimes devastating personal
consequences.

Labour recognises this injustice, and
will work with these women to design
a system of recompense for the losses
and insecurity they have suffered.

We will ensure that such an injustice
can never happen again by legislating
to prevent accrued rights to the state
pension from being changed.

The Conservatives have repeatedly
raised the state pension age despite
overseeing a decline in life expectancy.
Labour will abandon the Tories’ plans

TACKLE POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

to raise the State Pension Age, leaving
it at 66. We will review retirement ages
for physically arduous and stressful
occupations, including shift workers,
in the public and private sectors.

We will maintain the ‘triple lock’ and
guarantee the Winter Fuel Payment,
free TV licences and free bus passes
as universal benefits.

Thanks to automatic enrolment,
which was introduced by the last
Labour government, record numbers
of employees are now in workplace
pension schemes. But too many
people are still not saving enough
for a comfortable retirement.

We will stop people being auto-enrolled
into rip-off schemes and seek to

widen and expand access for more
low-income and self-employed workers.
We will establish an independent
Pensions’ Commission, modelled on the
Low Pay Commission, to recommend
target levels for workplace pensions.

We will create a single, comprehensive
and publicly run pensions dashboard
that is fully transparent, including
information about costs and charges.

We will legislate to allow the CWU-
Royal Mail agreement for a collective
pension scheme to proceed and allow
similar schemes.

Labour has listened to the NUM and

in government will end the injustice of
the state taking 50% of the surplus in
the Mineworkers’ Pension Scheme and

5

introduce new sharing arrangements
so that 10% goes to government and
90% stays with scheme members.
This new sharing arrangement will
also apply to the British Coal Staff
Superannuation Scheme.

We will ensure that the pensions of UK
citizens living overseas rise in line with
pensions in Britain.

76

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

Everyone has the right to
a decent, secure home.
In 1945, Labour promised
to ‘proceed witha
housing programme

with the maximum
practical speed until
every family in this island
has a good standard of
accommodation’. In 2019,
we renew that pledge.
But too many people

are being denied their
right to a good home by
our housing system that
treats homes as financial
assets rather than places
to live.

TACKLE POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

 

There is no starker symbol of the failing housing
system than the horror of the Grenfell Tower fire.

A Labour government will bring system-wide change,
so that a tragedy like Grenfell never happens again.
We will introduce a £1 billion Fire Safety Fund to fit
sprinklers and other fire safety measures in all high-
rise council and housing association tower blocks,
enforce the replacement of dangerous Grenfell-
style cladding on all high-rise homes and buildings,
while introducing mandatory building standards and
guidance, inspected and enforced by fully trained
Fire and Rescue Service fire safety officers.

Grenfell Tower was the confirmation of a more far-
reaching crisis. Everyone knows of someone affected
by the housing crisis: younger people unable to buy
a first home, renters trapped in damp flats, families
stuck on council waiting lists, leasehold home-owners
hit by unfair fees, people who are homeless living and
dying on our streets. The gap between the housing

7

haves and have-nots is at the heart
of the injustice in our country today.

Since 2010, the Conservatives have
slashed funding for new homes,
refused to regulate for higher standards
and given a free hand to commercial
property developers. There are fewer
new homes for social rent, a million
more households stuck renting from
a private landlord, 900,000 fewer
young people owning a home and
more than twice as many people
sleeping on our streets.

Only Labour has a plan to fix the
housing crisis. We will act on every front
to bring the cost of housing down and
standards up, so that everyone has a
decent, affordable place to call home.

Labour will create a new Department
for Housing, make Homes England a
more accountable national housing
agency and put councils in the driving
seat. We will set out a strategy fora
flourishing construction sector with a
skilled workforce and full rights at work.

Labour will set up a new English
Sovereign Land Trust, with powers to
buy land more cheaply for low-cost
housing. We will use public land to build
this housing, not sell it off to the highest
bidder. Developers will face new ‘use

it or lose it’ taxes on stalled housing
developments. We will keep the Land
Registry in public hands, and make
ownership of land more transparent.
We will make brownfield sites the
priority for development and protect
the green belt.

78

Labour will tackle the climate crisis and
cut energy bills by introducing a tough,
new zero-carbon homes standard for
all new homes, and upgrading millions
of existing homes to make them more
energy efficient. We will review the
planning guidance for developments

in flood risk areas.

Council and Social Homes

The only way to deliver on everyone's
tight to a good home is to build publicly
funded social housing.

Labour will deliver a new social
housebuilding programme of more than
a million homes over a decade, with
council housing at its heart. By the end
of the Parliament we will be building

at an annual rate of at least 150,000
council and social homes, with 100,000
of these built by councils for social rent
in the biggest council housebuilding
programme in more than a generation.
We will establish a new duty on councils
to plan and build these homes in their
area, and fund them to do so, with
backing from national government.

We will scrap the Conservatives’ bogus
definition of ‘affordable’, set as high

as 80% of market rents, and replace it
with a definition linked to local incomes.
These council and housing association
homes will be more affordable than
market housing and built to higher
standards. We will end the conversion
of office blocks to homes that
sidestep planning permission

through ‘permitted development’.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

We will stop the haemorrhage of low-
cost homes by ending the right to

buy, along with the forced conversion
of social rented homes to so-called
‘affordable rent’. We will review the case
for reducing the amount of housing
debt councils currently hold. And we will
give councils the powers and funding to
buy back homes from private landlords.

We will give tenants a stronger say in
the management of their homes and
stop social cleansing by making sure
regeneration only goes ahead when
it has the consent of residents, and
that all residents are offered a new
property on the same site and terms.
We will fund a new Decent Homes
programme to bring all council and
housing association homes up to a
good standard.

Home Ownership

Under the Tories, home ownership is
getting further out of reach for more
and more people. Numbers of new
affordable homes to buy have fallen,
and fewer younger people can afford
their own home. We will build more
low-cost homes reserved for first-time
buyers in every area, including Labour's
new discount homes with prices linked
to local incomes.

We will reform Help to Buy to focus
it on first-time buyers on ordinary
incomes. We will introduce a levy on
overseas companies buying housing,
while giving local people ‘first dibs’
on new homes built in their area. We

TACKLE POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

will bring empty homes back into use
by giving councils new powers to tax
properties empty for over a year.

Labour will end the scandal of leasehold
for the millions who have bought their
home but don't feel like they own it.

We will end the sale of new leasehold
properties, abolish unfair fees and
conditions, and give leaseholders the
right to buy their freehold at a price
they can afford. We will introduce
equivalent rights for freeholders on
privately owned estates.

Private Renters

More than 11 million people rent from a
private landlord and many of them are
at the sharp end of the housing crisis.
We will take urgent action to protect
private renters through rent controls,
open-ended tenancies, and new,
binding minimum standards.

Labour will stop runaway rents by
capping them with inflation, and give
cities powers to cap rents further.

We will give renters the security they
need to make their rented housing a
home, with new open-ended tenancies
to stop unfair, ‘no fault’ evictions. We
will make sure every property is up to
scratch with new minimum standards,
enforced through nationwide licensing
and tougher sanctions for landlords who
flout the rules. We will fund new renters’
unions in every part of the country - to
allow renters to organise and defend
their rights.

We will get rid of the discriminatory
rules that require landlords to check
people’s immigration status or that
allow them to exclude people on
housing benefit. We will give councils
new powers to regulate short-term lets
through companies such as Airbnb.

Homelessness

No one should sleep without a roof
over their head in one of the richest
countries in the world. But under the
Tories, the number of people sleeping
rough has more than doubled.

Over 125,000 children are now living in
temporary accommodation, without a
home to call their own - or the space
they need to thrive. Labour will tackle
the root causes of rising homelessness
with more affordable homes and
stronger rights for renters.

Labour will end rough sleeping within

five years, with a national plan driven by

a prime minister-led taskforce. We will
expand and upgrade hostels, turning
them into places where people can
turn their lives around. We will make
available 8,000 additional homes for

people with a history of rough sleeping.

We will tackle the wider causes of
homelessness, raising the Local

Housing Allowance in line with the 30th
percentile of local rents, and earmarking

an additional £1 billion a year for
councils’ homelessness services.

We will bring in a new national levy on
second homes used as holiday homes
to help deal with the homelessness
crisis, so that those who have done well
from the housing market pay a bit more
to help those with no home.

We will save lives this winter by
ensuring extra shelters and support are
in place in all areas. And we'll repeal the
Vagrancy Act and amend antisocial
behaviour legislation to stop the law
being used against people because
they are homeless.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

 

For many people, politics
doesn’t work. The
Westminster bubble is

a world away from their
daily lives. The Labour
Party was founded to
give working-class
people a voice in politics.

TACKLE POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

We want our political institutions to be connected fully
to the wider electorate, and will take urgent steps to
refresh our democracy.

The time has come for the real changes that a Labour
government will bring.

We will act immediately to end the hereditary
principle in the House of Lords, and work to abolish
the House of Lords in favour of Labour’s preferred
option of an elected Senate of the Nations and
Regions, but we also believe that the people must
be central to historic political changes.

The renewal of our Parliament will be subject to
recommendations made by a UK-wide Constitutional
Convention, led by a citizens’ assembly. This
Convention will answer crucial questions on how
power is distributed in the UK today, how nations
and regions can best relate to each other and how a
Labour government can best put power in the hands
of the people.

81

Only a Labour government will
safeguard the future of a devolved UK,
reforming the way in which it works to
make it fit for the future.

Britain is one of the most centralised
countries in Europe. Labour will
decentralise decision-making and
strengthen local democracy. We
reiterate our commitment to One
Yorkshire, and will make directly elected
mayors more accountable to local
councillors and elected representatives.

We will re-establish regional
Government Offices to make central
government more attuned to our
English regions, to support our regional
investments, and to enable the shift of
political power away from Westminster.

Our democratic revolution will also
extend to elections.

A Labour government will repeal the
Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which
has stifled democracy and propped up
weak governments. We will maintain
650 constituencies and respond
objectively to future, independent
boundary reviews. We will oversee the
largest extension of the franchise in
generations, reducing the voting age
to 16, giving full voting rights to all

UK residents, making sure everyone
who is entitled to vote can do so by
introducing a system of automatic voter
registration, and abandoning plans

to introduce voter ID which has been
shown to harm democratic rights.

82

Tackling Vested Interests

Labour will change how politics is
funded, banning donations from tax
avoiders and tax evaders, and closing
loopholes that allow the use of shell
companies to funnel dark money
into politics.

We will free the voices of civil society
by repealing the Lobbying Act 2014
and overhauling the rules that govern
corporate lobbying. We will introduce
a lobbying register covering both
in-house lobbyists and think tanks and
extending to contacts made with all
senior government employees, not
just ministers.

We will also increase the financial
penalties available to the Electoral
Commission and require imprints for
digital political adverts.

We will stop MPs from taking paid
second jobs, with limited exemptions
to maintain professional registrations
like nursing. We will replace ACOBA,
the business appointments committee,
with a sufficiently resourced and
empowered new body, governed by a
diverse and representative board and
established in law. We will also overhaul
the system of ministerial appointments
to public office.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

We will bring greater transparency by
extending Freedom of Information

rules to cover private providers of

public services, setting new standards
of consistent disclosure practice and
ending the six-month time limit in which
the Information Commissioner can
prosecute the deliberate destruction

of public records.

Northern Ireland

The Good Friday Agreement and long-
term peace in Northern Ireland is one
of the great achievements of Labour

in government. Therefore, as a priority,
Labour will work quickly and tirelessly to
secure the return of a genuine power-
sharing government in Northern Ireland.

The devolved power-sharing institutions
have not been running in Stormont

for over 1,000 days. During this period
people have suffered in the face of a
funding crisis as austerity continues to
damage public services, which Labour
will resolve.

Working with a new assembly and
power-sharing government, Labour
will invest an extra £19 billion to end
austerity and rebuild public services in
Northern Ireland.

TACKLE POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Women in Northern Ireland should
have access to abortions in Northern
Ireland. A Labour government will fully
implement new laws on equal marriage
in Northern Ireland so that same-

sex couples are no longer treated as
second-class citizens. We will work
with all major parties in Northern Ireland
to provide a good platform for the
restoration of devolution alongside
bringing forward and implementing

a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland as
outlined in the Good Friday Agreement.

A Labour government will also protect
Northern Ireland and its people in any
future Brexit outcome by ensuring
that there is no return to a hard border
between Northern Ireland and the
Republic of Ireland or the creation of a
regulatory border down the Irish Sea.

Wales

Labour's constitutional convention
will include the Welsh Government’s
20-point plan for the future of the UK
to better recognise the realities of a
devolved UK.

Alongside this work, we need long-term
reform of how the UK allocates public
expenditure to ensure that it reflects the
needs of different parts of our country
and that no nation or region of the UK is
unfairly disadvantaged.

Labour in Wales has pioneered the
social partnership approach. With a UK
Labour government investing an extra

£3.4 billion in Wales, and a UK Ministry
for Employment Rights we will be able
to do much more.

Wales led the first industrial revolution
and with a Labour government in
Westminster, we will be at the forefront
of the Green Industrial Revolution

of the future. We will create jobs in
Wales through environmental energy
schemes such as the Swansea Bay
tidal lagoon project.

The Tories have let down the people
of Ynys Mén (Anglesey) by failing to
deliver the Wylfa project. Labour will
work with people on the island to
maximise its potential for new nuclear
energy, alongside investment in
renewables.

Nine years of Tory cuts have done
untold damage and the Thomas
Commission on Justice in Wales is clear
that the justice system is not working
for Wales. Labour governments in Wales
and Westminster will work together,
using the Commission’s report, to put
that right.

Three years on from the 2016 EU
referendum we understand much
more about how Wales will be uniquely
exposed to a hard Brexit. Only Labour
will put this decision back in the hands
of the people, and in Wales the Welsh
Labour government will campaign

to remain.

84

Scotland

Labour in government will give around
700,000 Scottish workers a pay rise
when we introduce a Real Living Wage
of £10 an hour.

We will also provide Scotland with at
least around £100 billion of additional
resources over two terms. This
investment will transform Scotland’s
people, communities, public services
and industries.

As part of that additional resource
Labour would want to see £10 billion
from our new National Transformation
Fund invested in the building of 120,000
council and social homes in Scotland
over the next ten years, ending the
housing crisis and creating up to
50,000 jobs.

This is the difference a UK Labour
government would make to Scotland

As part of our Green Industrial
Revolution we will invest £6 billion in
retrofitting houses across Scotland,
which will help tackle the climate
emergency at the same time as
lowering bills, ending fuel poverty
and creating 35,000 jobs.

A UK Labour government will also
provide the Scottish National
Investment Bank, under Scottish
control, with £20 billion of lending
power to deliver funds to local projects
and Scotland’s small businesses.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

Labour believes that Scottish
independence would be economically
devastating and it would be the many
not the few who would pay the price.
Scotland needs the transformative
investment coming from a Labour
government, not another referendum
and not independence.

A UK Labour government will focus on
tackling the climate emergency, ending
austerity and cuts, and getting Brexit
sorted. That’s why in the early years of
a UK Labour government we will not
agree to a Section 30 order request if

it comes from the Scottish Government.

Labour will give the
people the final say

on Brexit. Within three
months of coming

to power, a Labour
government will secure
a sensible deal. And
within six months, we
will put that deal to a
public vote alongside
the option to remain.

A Labour government
will implement whatever
the people decide.

THE FINAL SAY ON BREXIT

yy

9

Only a Labour government will put this decision

 

in the hands of the people to give you the final say.
This will be a legally binding referendum and we
will implement the people’s decision immediately.

The Tories have failed for three years to get Brexit
sorted, in a shambles of repeated delays and
uncertainty. Whether people voted Leave or Remain
in 2016, people and businesses are crying out for
politicians in Westminster to finally focus on the
wider challenges we face.

Labour rules out a no-deal Brexit, and we will end the
scandal of billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money
being wasted on no-deal preparations. No deal has
never been a viable option. It would do enormous
harm to jobs, rights, security and to our NHS.

Labour has led the campaign to stop a no-deal Brexit.
A majority Tory government would pose a renewed
threat of the UK crashing out with no deal. Only a
Labour government can prevent this.

We will rip up the deeply flawed

deal negotiated by Boris Johnson.

We opposed his deal precisely because
it would do such harm to workers’ rights,
environmental protections and to our
manufacturing industry.

Boris Johnson’s deal is even worse than
Theresa Mav's: it would leave the UK
£70 billion worse off by 2029; it would
give the green light to deregulation
undermining UK manufacturing; and it
would leave our NHS at the mercy of

a trade deal with Donald Trump. This
sell-out deal is unacceptable to Labour.

Labour will secure a new Brexit deal

- one that protects jobs, rights and

the environment, avoids a hard border
in Northern Ireland and protects the
Good Friday Agreement and the peace
process. We will also ensure that there is
no change in the status or sovereignty
of Gibraltar.

Our deal will be based on the principles
we have set out over the last two years.

It will include:

+ A permanent and comprehensive
UK-wide customs union, which is vital
to protect our manufacturing industry
and allows the UK to benefit from joint
UK-EU trade deals, and is backed by
businesses and trade unions.

+ Close alignment with the Single
Market - ensuring we have a strong
future economic relationship with the
EU that can support UK businesses.

+ Dynamic alignment on workers’ rights,
consumer rights and environmental
protections so that UK standards keep
pace across Europe as a minimum,
allowing the UK to lead the way,
not fall behind.

* Continued participation in EU
agencies and funding programmes,
including in such vital areas of
co-operation as the environment,
scientific research and culture.

+ Clear commitments on future security
arrangements, including access to the
European Arrest Warrant and shared
databases, making people safer at
home and abroad.

Labour will secure a revised Withdrawal
Agreement that provides legal protection
for citizens’ rights, meets our international
obligations - particularly with regard

to the Good Friday Agreement - and
ensures an appropriate transition period
to allow businesses and citizens to
adapt to any new arrangements.

We will also secure robust and legally
binding protections for workers’ rights,
consumer standards and environmental
protections, and ensure level-playing-
field protections are maintained. Labour
will never accept an outcome that puts
tights and standards at risk.

Once we have secured this new deal
we will put it to a legally binding
referendum alongside the option

of remaining in the EU.

This will take place within the first six
months of a Labour government.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

Labour is the only party that can

heal the harmful divisions in our
communities and address the
devastation caused by 10 years of
austerity, ruthlessly imposed on society
by the Tories and Lib Dems. While other
parties have exacerbated polarisation,
defining everyone by how they voted

in the 2016 EU Referendum, Labour has
consistently reached across this divide.

Only Labour will deliver a final say
referendum.

Only Labour will offer the choice of
remaining in the EU, or leaving with
a sensible deal.

This final say referendum will not be a
re-run of 2016. It will be legally binding.
Labour will implement the decision of
the British people immediately.

Labour will introduce legislation to
facilitate this referendum and to provide
legal certainty and stability following
the result.

We will introduce a Withdrawal
Agreement and Referendum Bill,
providing the legal basis to conduct
and implement the outcome of the
referendum.

We will scrap the Brexit legislation
currently proposed by the Tories and
introduce new legislation that is in line
with Labour's priorities and principles
to protect our economy, trade, jobs
and rights.

This will include new legislation to
ensure support and certainty for UK

THE FINAL SAY ON BREXIT

farmers, our fishing industry and
protection for our natural environment.

Labour recognises the huge benefits of
immigration to our country. Many British
citizens have benefited from freedom
of movement, which has given them
the opportunity to study, work or retire
abroad. Likewise our public services and
our industry have benefited from skilled
workers coming here.

Labour believes that citizens’ rights
should never have been used as

a bargaining chip in the Brexit
negotiations, and recognises the huge
anxiety this has caused for the three
million EU nationals living in the UK and
the 1.2 million UK nationals who have
made their home elsewhere in the EU.

We will end the uncertainty created by
the EU Settlement Scheme by granting
EU nationals the automatic right to
continue living and working in the UK.
This new declaratory system will allow
EU nationals the chance to register

for proof of status if they wish, but will
mean they no longer have to apply

to continue living and working in this
country. This will help ensure reciprocal
treatment for UK citizens living in the
EU. It will also prevent a repeat of the
shameful Windrush scandal and avoid
unnecessarily criminalising hundreds
of thousands of EU nationals.

If in a referendum the British people
decide to remain in the EU, this must
not mean accepting the status quo.
Labour will work with partners across
Europe to make the case for radical

reform of the EU - in particular to
ensure that its collective strength

is focused on tackling the climate
emergency, tax evasion and ending
austerity and inequality.

The EU needs a new political direction
and, if the people decide the UK
should remain in the EU, Labour will
lead the way to ensure that change.

For too long a politically inflicted wave
of austerity has damaged communities
across Britain and across Europe.

The most vulnerable members in

our society have suffered, while the
super-rich continue to be rewarded by
a system that allows them to thrive at
the expense of the many.

This must change. If the country
decides to remain, a Labour
government will take a different
approach and strive to ensure that
the EU works for people across our
communities. The EU should focus on
policies that value investment, protect
public services and make those who
have the most pay their fair share.

If people decide to leave, a Labour
government will work constructively
with the EU on vital issues of mutual
interest and to the mutual benefit of
the UK and EU. But we will leave the EU.

Most importantly, under a Labour
government, you will get the final
say on Brexit.

Human Rights

Human rights and international
humanitarian law are fundamental

pillars of a secure global system. These
principles are under threat. Some of the
world’s most powerful states choose to
sell arms to human-rights abusing states.
Conservative ministers, including Boris
Johnson, have signed off well over

£2 billion of arms sales to repressive
regimes since June 2017.

Around the world, human rights
defenders and civil society activists
remain vulnerable to attacks, often carried
out with impunity.

We will:

+ Immediately suspend the sale of arms
to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen and to
Israel for arms used in violation of the
human rights of Palestinian civilians, and
conduct a root-and-branch reform of
our arms exports regime so ministers
can never again turn a blind eye to
British-made weapons being used
to target innocent civilians.

+ Reform the international rules-
based order to secure justice and
accountability for breaches of human
rights and international law, such as
the bombing of hospitals in Syria, the
illegal blockade of the Gaza Strip, the
use of rape as a weapon of war against

98

the Rohingya community in Myanmar
and the indiscriminate bombardment of
civilians in Yemen.

+ We will work through the UN and
the Commonwealth to insist on the
protection of human rights for Sri
Lanka’s minority Tamil and Muslim
populations.

+ Appoint human-rights advisers
to work across the Foreign Office and
government to prioritise a co-ordinated
approach to human rights.

+ Advocate for human rights at every
bilateral diplomatic meeting.

Climate Diplomacy

There is no greater injustice today than
countries in the Global South paying

the price for a climate crisis they did not
cause. Yet some world leaders, including
US President Donald Trump and Brazilian
President Jair Bolsonaro, champion a
climate-change denial agenda.

Britain’s climate-change diplomacy

was respected internationally, playing
an important role in securing the Paris
Agreement, following the leading role
the UK played in securing the Kyoto
Agreement. However, Boris Johnson -
who has described global warming as a
‘primitive fear.. without foundation’ - has
overseen a 60% cut in the Uk’s global
network of climate experts.

Only Labour can rebuild Britain’s
leadership on the most serious threat
to our shared humanity.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

We will:

+ Rebuild our climate expertise
within the Foreign Office, putting
climate diplomacy at the heart of
our foreign policy.

+ Use our influence at the UN, EU, G7, G20,
World Bank, the Commonwealth and other
global institutions to promote policies
to tackle the climate emergency.

+ Use our diplomatic expertise to
negotiate and deliver more ambitious
global targets to deal with the climate
emergency, starting with COP 26 in
Glasgow next year.

Prioritising Conflict Prevention
and Building Peace

The Conservatives have failed to play

a constructive role in resolving the
world’s most pressing humanitarian
crises, including in Kashmir, Yemen and
Myanmar, and the escalation of tensions
with Iran. The treatment of the Kurdish
people in Syria, including by Turkey, and
of the Uighurs in China has been met
with total inaction and apathy by the
current UK government. In some cases,
they set aside regard for international
law, including refusing to criticise Crown
Prince Mohammed Bin Salman of Saudi
Arabia over the murder of journalist Jamal
Khashoggi.

Labour is committed to a comprehensive
peace in the Middle East based on a two-
state solution - a secure Israel alongside
a secure and viable state of Palestine.
There can be no military solution to this

ANEW INTERNATIONALISM

conflict, which must be settled on the
basis of justice and international law.

All sides must avoid taking action that
would make peace harder to achieve.
That means both an end to the blockade,
occupation and settlements, and an

end to rocket and terror attacks. Labour
will continue to press for an immediate
return to meaningful negotiations leading
to a diplomatic resolution. A Labour
government will immediately recognise
the state of Palestine.

Labour will take all lawful action
necessary to counter and confront all
forms of terrorism, and we will advocate a
long-term multinational political strategy,
led by regional actors, to tackle the
spread of extremism.

We believe effective diplomacy
can address the drivers of conflict
and insecurity.

We will:

+ Build support for UN reform,
including assessing and developing
democratisation initiatives, and
improving the engagement of the
General Assembly in decision-making to
ensure its institutions are more effective
at achieving peace.

+ Prioritise our responsibility to prevent
conflict by investing in local capacities
for peacebuilding in areas of conflict
- advocating for political, multilateral
strategies for peace.

+ Act immediately to urge negotiations
towards a political resolution to conflict
wherever it arises, including in the Middle
East and sub-Saharan Africa.

DEFENCE AND SECURITY _

The primary duty

of government is to
guarantee the security
of people in the UK.
Labour’s defence
policy will be strategic
and evidence-led.

Our security at home
is made stronger
when the security of
others elsewhere is
guaranteed too.

100

 

An incoming Labour government will undertake a
Strategic Defence and Security Review to assess

the security challenges facing Britain, including new
forms of hybrid, cyber and remote warfare. This review
will also take account of the climate emergency, and
associated threats of resource competition, involuntary
migration and violent conflict.

Under the Conservatives:

+ Boris Johnson refuses to publish the report
into possible foreign interference by Russia
in UK democracy.

+ Trained army personnel have been cut from 102,000
to just over 74,000.

- Armed forces and their families have been forced to
live in sub-standard accommodation.

+ Failing outsourced contracts have not been
terminated.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

+ Our Armed Forces personnel
received below-inflation pay rises
for seven years.

The security challenges we face know
no borders. Labour will increase funding
for UN peacekeeping operations to
£100 million. We will maintain our
commitment to NATO and our close
relationship with our European partners,
and we will use our influence at the
United Nations to support peace and
security worldwide.

Labour supports the renewal of the
Trident nuclear deterrent. Labour
will also actively lead multilateral
efforts under our obligations to the
Non-Proliferation Treaty to create a
nuclear-free world.

Labour’s commitment to spend at least
2% of GDP on defence will guarantee
that our armed forces are versatile and
capable of fulfilling the full range of
roles and obligations.

We will scrap the public sector pay
cap, which resulted in a real-terms

pay cut for our armed forces, ensure
decent housing for forces members
and their families, and guarantee better
access for all forces children to good
quality local schools. We will consult

on creating a representative body for
the armed forces, akin to the Police
Federation.

Labour will improve opportunities for
veterans through access to lifelong
learning and training, housing and
mental and physical health services,

ANEW INTERNATIONALISM

and will seek greater consistency in the
implementation of the Armed Forces
Covenant by public authorities.

We will pay a lump sum of £50,000
to each surviving British nuclear-test
veteran to support them and their
families with the health conditions
they have suffered as a result of
exposure to radiation. We will also
ensure that black and Asian soldiers
who fought in Britain’s colonial armies
receive a full apology and explore
ways to compensate them for the
discriminatory demob payments they
received compared to their white
counterparts serving at the same rank
in the same regiments.

The UK defence industry is world-
leading and Labour will continue to
work with manufacturers, unions and
export partners in line with Labour's
foreign policy to support innovation
in this sector to ensure it maintains
its highly skilled workforce and world-
class apprenticeship programme. We
are committed to procurement that
supports UK defence manufacturing
including our aerospace and
shipbuilding, alongside a vibrant
supply chain that includes the British
steel industry and other component
manufacturing companies providing
good jobs throughout supply chains.
Labour will publish a Defence Industrial
Strategy White Paper, including a
National Shipbuilding Strategy, that
keeps all Royal Navy and Royal Fleet
Auxiliary shipbuilding contracts in the

UK, to secure a long-term future for the
industry and its workers.

Reducing our carbon footprint can
only happen with ambitious emissions
reduction targets at the Ministry of
Defence, one of government's biggest
energy users. So as part of our Green
Industrial Revolution, we will create

a Climate Change Sustainability
Committee within the department to
review the feasibility of increasing the
use of sustainable energy in defence,
and publish a strategy to accelerate the
safe and sustainable recycling of our
old nuclear submarines.

102

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

The scale of the
challenges facing our
world are enormous.
Conflict, climate change
and a global economy
rigged in favour of a tiny
elite are driving instability
and inequality across the
world. A bold international
development policy driven
by social justice has never
been more needed.

ANEW INTERNATIONALISM

 

Labour will use Britain’s influence within the World
Bank, IMF and WTO to transform the rules of the
global economy so they work for the many.

We recognise the need to address historic injustices
and will reset our relationships with countries in the
Global South based on principles of redistribution
and equality, not outdated notions of charity or
imperialist rule. Unlike the Conservatives, Labour

is fully committed to a standalone Department for
International Development (DfID), with an aid budget
of at least 0.7% of gross national income. We will
introduce the reduction of inequality as a goal for all
aid spending alongside existing poverty reduction and
gender equality goals.

For the Conservatives, too often humanitarian aid is
undermined by their disastrous foreign policy, as in
Yemen. Under Labour, we will ensure policy coherence
across our international-facing departments. Under

103

Labour, DfID will continue to respond

to the world’s biggest crises and will
ensure humanitarian aid is provided
according to need, not whether the

UK has commerical or other interests

in the country. DfID will assume a
strong position in cross-government
decision making, including a permanent
seat on the Export Control Joint Unit
responsible for licensing arms exports.

Our international programme
will be based on human rights
and gender equality.

We will:

+ Uphold basic rights to education,
health and clean water by establishing
a new Unit for Public Services
within DfID, which will include
increasing direct budgetary support
to governments so they can build
sustainable services for their citizens.

+ Promote fairer international tax rules
and help countries in the Global South
build progressive tax systems to
finance essential public services.

+ Support trade unions internationally
in their efforts to promote collective
bargaining for better pay and
conditions, and include binding social
chapters in trade agreements to
safeguard workers’ rights.

+ Support ongoing UN efforts to introduce
a binding international treaty on business
and human rights, and make companies
legally accountable for failing to prevent
human rights abuses or environmental

104

damage in their operations and supply
chains, including criminal liability in the
most serious cases.

+ Implement a gender transformative
approach across all our international
work, including tripling funding for
grassroots women’s organisations
and establishing an independent
ombudsman to tackle abuse in the
development sector.

Labour believes in climate justice.
Wealthy countries like the UK bear the
greatest responsibility for the climate
emergency. Countries in the Global
South that have done the least to cause
climate change are already facing the
worst impacts, such as rising sea levels,
more frequent hurricanes and greater
food insecurity. We have a duty to right
this wrong.

We will:

+ Provide a top-up of new and
additional spending on international
climate finance to bring the total to
£4 billion a year, and also support
international calls for compensation
to those nations already suffering loss
and damage.

+ Stop all aid spending on fossil fuel
production overseas, redirecting it
towards clean, renewable energy
for all.

+ End all UK Export Finance support
to fossil fuel projects, and reject any
trade deals that conflict with our
climate principles.

IT’S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE

+ Undertake a root-and-branch reform
of CDC Group ple (DfID’s principal
vehicle for encouraging private
sector investment in developing
countries), transforming it into a green
development bank mandated to
fight poverty, inequality and climate
change.

Labour respects the crucial role played
by small-scale farmers the world over in
guaranteeing people the right to food.

We will:

+ Establish an aid-funded Food
Sovereignty Fund to enable small-
scale farmers in the Global South
to gain access to land, seeds and
finance, and uphold indigenous
peoples’ right to land.

+ Support sustainable local food and
agriculture markets in the fight against
climate change.

Labour believes human rights should
drive our trade policy.

We will:

+ Implement UK arms export controls
to the highest standard, putting an
end to exports where they might be
used in violation of human rights or
international humanitarian law.

+ Ensure government procurement
contracts are not granted to
companies that are complicit in
serious human rights abuses, and
require all UK trade agreements
to be consistent with international
humanitarian law.

ANEW INTERNATIONALISM

+ Introduce legislation to ensure
transparency and parliamentary
scrutiny of trade and investment
agreements.

+ Reject any trade agreements that
undermine labour standards or
environmental protections, and rule
out UK Export Finance support to
companies engaged in bribery or
corruption.

Labour recognises the right to essential
medicines as an integral part of the
right to health.

We will:

+ Promote fairer international patent
regimes that do not prevent countries
from accessing essential medicines
and support efforts to increase the
transparency of medicines pricing so
governments can negotiate fair prices.

+ In the long term, ensure that all
medicines developed with the support
of UK taxpayer money are accessible
to people in the Global South.
